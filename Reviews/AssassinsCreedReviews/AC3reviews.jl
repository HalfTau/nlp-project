The main story doesn't really start until 5+ hours in and you spend the beginning of the game playing as a different character from the main protagonist which might confuse some people. The main protagonist of the game (Connor) is pretty boring and the American setting is pretty weak by AC standards, but this was also the first AC game to run in a new version of the anvil engine, which brought a lot of new features to the franchise like climbing trees and rocks, better and smoother climbing and better stealth, and future games would not be so good if this game didn't exist. This game has its flaws, but Ubisoft did actually try and innovate this time after 4 previous games with copy and pasted gameplay, animations and sound effects.

Everything works fine but when it's an xbox controller the camera panics and continually shoots to the left side in the most jittery, sporadic fashion. With an xbox controller plugged in, any fall longer than a few inches would immediately cause the camera to rapidly face different directions, and this happened every time I slipped or slid a few inches.\nThere's an over population of mobs making freeroaming unenjoyable. For example, wandered around a rock and got mugged by a cougar. 3 minutes later was mugged by a wolf with another cougar comin' to nip at my nuts. Fell off a cliff because the collission and detection for solid flat planes seems to be non-existant, and fell directly on to an Elk.

Once I ran about 5-6 feet I immediately desynchronized and clipped through the bottom of the pit.\nWhat's weird to me is that I played this game two years ago and none of these things were an issue then.

Ushered to undertake the secretive training of the Assassin brotherhood, the boy grows into a humble but deadly warrior who goes by the infinitely easier to pronounce name of Connor.  The Assassin Brotherhood fights to preserve the free will of humanity while the opposing and equally secretive Templar Order fights to topple it.  Following Connor's story with the use of a special device, Desmond Miles is a modern day Assassin reliving his ancestor's memories in order to locate a key that will unlock the way into a temple that predates humanity itself.  Built by a civilization that came before but was eradicated by a solar flare, the temple is humanity's only hope of stopping the next oncoming flare.  Desmond finds himself occassionally making forays out into the world to retrieve power sources for the temple from the modern day Templar's clutches.  Connor's story is depressingly off the mark from its true potential.  It has everything it needs to be an enthralling tale.  War.  Mystery.  Family conflicts.  Blurring moral lines that ask interesting questions.  A fascinating historical setting.  But through either poor execution, poor direction, or just a lack of necessary time; the story fails to deliver consistently or in some cases at all.  It's also eye-rollingly ridiculous in its treatment of the period.  Connor is directly involved in if not usually directly responsible for every single major event in the entirety of the revolution from Paul Revere's ride to the signing of the Declaration.  Desmond's story meanwhile just isn't there enough and spends more time on the history of those who came before than on the man himself.\nAlso included is a side story split into three episodes.  This story throws Connor into an alternate universe in which George Washinton, fresh off of his victory over the Britsh; declares himself king of America and devolves into a vile and tyrranical ruler that Connor must bring down.  The story throws out several threads that are either unresolved or simply fail to capture any emotion at all.\nAn action-adventure game at its heart, Assassin's Creed III also incorporates economy and crafting management, several board games, and naval combat on the open seas.  On foot, Connor is an unstoppable power house capable of scaling sheer rock faces and murdering groups of enemy combatants by the dozen.  Combat itself is far too easy and despite the genuinely heavy and satisfying animations; becomes a tedious distraction over time.  Parkour movement in the game runs the gambit from \"that did exactly what I wanted it to do\" to \"GET OFF OF THE FENCE\".  Naval combat somehow manages to shine.  Putting Connor at the helm of the speedy and cannon laden Aquila, the repetitive naval engagements somehow never get old as you manage your course and line up with your enemies for broadside cannon fire.  The ocean simulation rocks the ship to and fro as stormy waves provide cover.  Overall though, the gameplay feels more like a device to push the narrative foward than the primary reason to buy the game.  There are a ridiculous number of collectibles and little side objectives that require gathering and crafting goods all across the landscape.\nAnd NEVER play Twelve Mens Morris.  Ever.\nThe game seems so aware of its tedium in the King Washington side-story, that is starts granting supernatural powers allowing you to straight up bypass previous game mechanics quickly.\nOverall the game feels rushed but built by talent.  It can absolutely dazzle you one second and throw you for a loop the next.  The primary characters, their faces especially, are rich in detail and emotion.  The game swaps between seasons as its years roll by and the winter landscape is really something else.  Deep, deep snow forces characters to plod along as it straddles their waists.  Which brings us to animation, which is simultaneously incredible and confounding.  Connor in particular has a movement animation for just about every angle of incline and type of terrain.  His clmbing and combat moves are weighty and satisfying and initially help to break up some of the boredom.  However they also never seem to line up properly with what they're supposed to interact with.  Connor seems to be a magician capable of climbing the air by merely reacing out in the general direction of a nearby ladder, for instance.  Sailing across the ocean is particularly well done as shipmates scurry across the vessel to perform their tasks while cannon balls rip the ship to pieces and the beautiful water laps at the hull.  Music is an absolute high point and draws even more emotion out of the often stellar voice acting.  Connor in particular has a strange but comforting cadence to his speech.\nHowever, I encountered no small list of bugs, crashes, and, in the first episode of the King Washington story, a progress halting bug that shall forever prevent me from seeing the episode to its conclusion.", "hours": 61.0, "user_id": "76561198004162646", "username": "connordavisj", "products": 424, "early_access": false}

I will start with the Pros:\nPros\n- It's a great learning experience about the history of before,during,and after the Revolutionary War. Read newspapers, hear town criers talk and complain to the people about the bad things the british are doing, and reading the wealth of information about all the prominent figures during the Revolutionary War is fun to do IF you're into that sort of thing.\n- The climbing and combat system is much better than the previous Assassins Creed games except for a couple things that I will point out in the cons.\n- The story is the best so far but I do agree with everyone else that the game is VERY SLOW in the beginning stage. The game doesnt seem to give you freedom as an assassin until halfway through the game which is just mind boggling.\n- The ship combat is fun and is what motivated Ubisoft to make what I think is the best Assassins Creed game Black Flag, so I just had to put that as a Pro.\nCons\n- Graphical anomalies and character pop ins EVERYWHERE. You can see every single character pop into the game when you're riding a horse in the city. Breaks immersion. The game does not perform well if the game is over 60fps so you have to manually downgrade the game to 60 to make the game work correctly. There is no resolution modifier in game which is just baffling and you have to manually change the resolution through a config file. There is no vsync.\n- The game is just extremely boring to begin with, especially when compared to Assassins Creed 2. There are collectibles, but you get rewarded nothing until you find them all in the game, which is just an unessesary grind. Remember the feathers in AC2 where each one you collected gave you a very little upgrade in money for your homestead? THAT is a collectible. There are side missions, but you gain little reward for doing them compared to previous entries and your noteriety goes up during most of them which is a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 After about 60 hours playing through this game it seems that 80% of the games map you never explore or dont want to explore since there is nothing to do in them.\n- The UI and the controls for this game is trash, calling for assassins is a chore, having to pause the game and tell your assassins what to do instead of in the previous games where you just have to press a button and POOF heres comes your badass assassins. In this game the simpliest things are destroyed by the trash UI system. Calling for assassins, upgrading your homestead, trading using your homestead, trading with traders, and even using your map and setting markers is a chore on PC using PC controls.\n- You can hunt and gather supplies for your homestead which you can upgrade, but compared to previous AC's it is much more confusing using this system and you get very little reward for doing them which makes you never want to play it. In Assassins Creed 2 you get an understandable amount of money for upgrading shops and whatnot. But in AC3 you get 20 bucks for doing trading missions to upgrade your homestead, and most good weapons in this game cost over 5000 dollars. Completely pointless system. So fast travlling to my homestead, understanding the confusing system, going through the crappy UI controls, just to get 20-50 dollars? No thanks, i'll pass upgrading my homestead.\n- Though the combat is more refined, there is one thing that doesnt make sense and that is the enemies are pretty much invincible until you combo kill them, they do not have health bars like in ALL PREVIOUS AC TITLES. This means that if you keep hitting enemies 1 or 2 times each you will never be able to kill anyone since it seems that enemies can only be killed if you hit them X times in a row or if you counter kill them. I have tested this numerous times where I would see a lone enemy and then just hit him once or twice then block, and he would never die, I would hit him a total of 30 times, and he would just keep fighting like nothing ever happens. Really dumb, especially when you want to keep all your enemies on your toes by fighting each one a little bit so they dont creep up on you and grab you, stab you in the back etc.\n- The noteriety system is ridiculous in this game, this game gets REALLY HARD if you have noteriety. Running away from enemies is much more of a time waste then it used to be. If you did a dirty deed and an enemy sees you, you would usually run away and run 100 or 200 meters then hid in a haystack ro whatnot. But if there are enemies 2-3 blocks away they will instantly know who you are and start chasing you even though they never witnessed what you did in the first place. This makes running and hiding extremely tedious and time consuming, again, unlike the previous AC titles. I never do any of the side missions like killing all of the people taxing the patriots just because I hate having high noteriety because its annoying so I never want to do any of the side missions.\n- There are many things you can do and use and the game BARELY tells you about them. Halfway through my first playthrough I didnt know you could fast travel. I didnt know until recently that the tunnels gave you fast travel points if you explore them. Didn't know there was a Horse whistle until recently. Didn't know there was Trip mines in the game. The game really sucks at telling you everything you can do in the game.\nI would only recommend this game for two reasons. 1. If you never played any assassins creed games before you might like it. But this game is such a downgrade from the previous titles in every way possible. 2. If you are into the Assassins creed story and want to know the games lore then you have to play through this game since the ending (which i didnt appreciate) is very important in the AC universe. If you dont care for both of those things then just go play Black Flag or AC2, games which are better in every single avenue compared to this game.", "hours": 64.0, "user_id": "76561197973213964", "username": "Recondo", "products": 303, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Heard some complaints about Connor's attitude/ naivety but there's something about him entering a world so alien to his own that means that although he sometimes acts and sounds like a child, it's passionate, and some of his dialogue especially when he threatens or acts cocky is so well done. Combat is enjoyable and arguably unique with a lot of toys to play with, tough until you realise each enemy has a certain counter that never works and one that always works, but still fun to get those counter kills. You can just counter your way through basic soldiers, but with a mix it's fun to play around to tackle each individual one. Side missions are basic, offering 3x of a task but that's more for your own enjoyment at sticking it to the British than anything else. And that's coming from a Brit. Didn't try the brawlers club or anything like the thieves/ \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s/ mercenaries of 2 and BHood and Revelations.\nMy main gripe is the inconsistency with certain aspects. Depending on where you are in the game, sometimes in missions particularly enemy awareness is yanked up to overdrive. I had one particular moment when hiding behind cover I saw 4 guards facing the opposite way in a line, so I left cover to walk behind them. Should be easy. They saw me instantly. Yet outside of missions you can do what you always do in previous games and walk up to a guard slowly, subtly assassinate, and leave with his friends none the wiser. Another mission required an air assassination of a target alongside remaining undetected, yet despite air assassinating the dude a good 20 metres away from others, behind two big pillars of boxes, with the other two not even being scripted on looking at you and were completely engrossed in something else, they find you INSTANTLY. There's also a mission that requires no kills for full synch, but if you assassinate with fists it counts as knocking them out or something. Try that in any other mission that requires you stay under a kill count, and it'll still notch up. It's just in that first mission that because you can't actually beat it without taking out one guard, they let you off - elsewhere it's not so easy, and I don't know why. Either make unarmed assassination not a kill, or remove the need for knocking someone unconcious in the first place as you can't beat it without knocking one dude out. Some of the full synchronisation things were a pain (see above) but some were enjoyable, and worth doing. To the less stubborn of you I'd say try it 3-4 times, if it doesn't happen just give up because it'll only make you angry.\nStoryline was enjoyable, if a bit predictable like AC1. Work your way through the Templars until you win. Ship warfare is a blast though, literally. Big plot twist early on that WAS thoroughly enjoyable, and some of the smaller missions about the Revolutionary War, as well as voice acting both by named characters and general enemies being fantastic, and animation, graphics and the history provided by Shaun being really amazing. As far as characters go, without spoilering I'd say perspective is EVERYTHING. I hated the villains and wanted them dead as much as the antagonist did, which is such a twist from earlier chapters. Desmond's storyline was a bit dull and forgettable, and I genuinely think I missed a bit because I swear a character appeared who everyone knew but I don't remember being mentioned at all in earlier games. It did finish the story all off I suppose, even if it was a bit frustrating and weak. I've not played anything after so I don't know how the story progresses, but I hope it goes well.\nGood at rambling but basically good PC port, doesn't ask too much of your settings. General storyline was great from the second half, meh to decent at first. Even at full price I would say it's worth it, but if you can get it for 25-30% off that's even better. It's different but worth including in your library - just find something to do during the credits. Over 20 minutes long, UNSKIPPABLE unless you dramatically turn your PC off. There's a couple of nice cutscenes to wrap things up, and then an intro to multiplayer and bonus stuff for replay value, but once you've done the storyline there's not much to do apart from collectibles and side missions. Try it for yourself, it has its flaws but every AC does - overall still a strong contender in the series.", "hours": 39.3, "user_id": "76561198102612532", "username": "ExplicitPigeon", "products": 79, "early_access": false}

There are a few reasons for this, but what made me decide to quit it early was the insane amount of crashes I experience on Windows 10. Getting to the end of the storyline, the game froze and crashed almost every twenty minutes. Also, I should mention that you cannot run this game off an external hard drive. Long story short, if you want an optimized game don't buy it.\nAs for the game itself, Assassin's Creed III is in a bit of an awkward spot between the very well received Assassin's Creed II and the \"next gen\" Black Flag. It is cleary experimenting with an open world, naval battles, original story elements et cetera, but can't quite execute them in the envisioned way. The open world is not really open, and many of the forests are bland and repetitive. Much of the world is sort of empty and without much to do. Also, AC3 tries to give a huge depth to its story, featuring an unusual protagonist (and antagonist), and generally throwing lots and lots of characters at the player. Personally I didn't like the protagonist, even later in the story, whereas I could grow into Ezio in AC2, and AC1 had a much shorter story to make up for its relatively generic protagonist. And then the game introduces even more weapons and gameplay elements (including naval battles) than its predecessor. It is admirable, but I would say it gives the game a lack of focus. Altogether, some of the game was fun, but a lot of it also felt like a chore.\nPlaying this between AC2 and Black Flag, you will have probably overlooked many of the game's rough edges, but if you have played Black Flag or any later part of the series, going back to AC3 will feel clunky and uneasy.

I really liked brotherhood and revelations so I kinda held high hopes for this. But it is not what I wanted. I mean, sure, the gameplay can be fun sometimes, especially when you enter a killing spree but it can be tiring to constantly trying to hide from dozens of guards that exist in every corner. Hell, Connor can take all of them but I'm a stealth player. And having dozens of guards on my trail because one of them looked at me for too long is tiring.\nBut, that wasn't my main problem with it. My main problem was that I wasn't immersed in it as I thought I'd be. The tree parkour wasn't as good as I thought and I ended up unable to climb a tree because of my positioning several times. The story was meh, cause the setting doesn't offer much. Boston ain't as immersive as Rome. The consumable items and weapons were pretty much useless (why use a smoke bomb when there are three guards around every corner ? Why use a rope dart when there aren't guards that the rope dart can be used on without triggering an alarm ?). Connor himself was kinda nice but I found myself hoping that I could play with haytham more, idk, he seems better as a character. The manor can't be compared to the auditore villa, it kinda sucks. The hunting and the naval battles were awesome af, the combat system was nice and I'd buy a DLC that would offer more large scale battles.\nIn general, this was a mediocre game but I can see why people enjoy it. It has some nice elements in it and it IS an assassin's creed game with some modern features. So yeah, I wouldn't really suggest it to players not experienced with the series. But for a regular AC player, it's a pretty good game. To conclude, it is enjoyable but not as good as you'll find yourself hoping it was. 6/10\nPs. The sound desynchronizes with the animations and it is very irritating.

The story is less engaging, the secondary quests feel like an afterthought, and the free-running is less intuitive/buggier, but the combat and tools are marginally improved.  You play through essentially an 8 hour tutorial before getting to the bulk of the game.  Overall, I spent around 30 hours on the pre-DLC content, completing most of the secondary quests but few of the collection quests.\nThe assassin brotherhood sort of feature returns and naval combat is an option.  However, none of the secondary quests feel rewarding.  In most cases, a new outfit is unlocked after spending a few hours collecting items.  There's also a few trading systems, but they weren't very well introduced and I didn't see any need for collecting the currency anyways.  I encountered a number of awkward jumps/falls and one situation where I got stuck inside of a rock feature.  But I didn't experience any crashes.\nWhile the overall review tone isn't very promising, I'd still recommend the game if you enjoyed the other AC games.  Definitely on sale though.

The gameplay itself is good apart from the occasional issue for randomly scaling up a wall when you simply intended to run past it. The game feels unpolished and a bit lack lustre.

Ubisoft simply could not be bothered to fix basic things like this. Why can't I fast travel directly where I want to be. Also, I dealt with the typical Ubisoft consolitus issues. My game kept crashing because I didn't have vsync enabled in the graphics settings...I mean, really? A game developed for pc, which is a platform that takes advantage of high refresh rates has to have the framerate locked? There are also some really pointless gameplay sections where you are literally just required to walk 20 meters into another cut scene. I think Ubisoft needs to start questioning \"why would player would want to do this?\", or, \"is this a fun part to have in the game?\" and then simply remove elements if they dont check the boxes.

It also exists among significant populations outside of the sub continent and has over 900 million adherents worldwide.\nIn some ways Hinduism is the oldest living religion in the world, or at least elements within it stretch back many thousands of years. Yet Hinduism resists easy definition partly because of the vast array of practices and beliefs found within it. It is also closely associated conceptually and historically with the other Indian religions Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.\nUnlike most other religions, Hinduism has no single founder, no single scripture, and no commonly agreed set of teachings. Throughout its extensive history, there have been many key figures teaching different philosophies and writing numerous holy books. For these reasons, writers often refer to Hinduism as 'a way of life' or 'a family of religions' rather than a single religion.\nDefining Hinduism\nThe term 'Hindu' was derived from the river or river complex of the northwest, the Sindhu. Sindhu is a Sanskrit word used by the inhabitants of the region, the Aryans in the second millennium BCE. Later migrants and invaders, the Persians in the sixth century BCE, the Greeks from the 4th century BCE, and the Muslims from the 8th century CE, used the name of this river in their own languages for the land and its people.\nThe term 'Hindu' itself probably does not go back before the 15th and 16th centuries when it was used by people to differentiate themselves from followers of other traditions, especially the Muslims (Yavannas), in Kashmir and Bengal. At that time the term may have simply indicated groups united by certain cultural practices such as cremation of the dead and styles of cuisine. The 'ism' was added to 'Hindu' only in the 19th century in the context of British colonialism and missionary activity.\nThe origins of the term 'hindu' are thus cultural, political and geographical. Now the term is widely accepted although any definition is subject to much debate. In some ways it is true to say that Hinduism is a religion of recent origin yet its roots and formation go back thousands of years.\nSome claim that one is 'born a Hindu', but there are now many Hindus of non-Indian descent. Others claim that its core feature is belief in an impersonal Supreme, but important strands have long described and worshipped a personal God. Outsiders often criticise Hindus as being polytheistic, but many adherents claim to be monotheists.\nSome Hindus define orthodoxy as compliance with the teachings of the Vedic texts (the four Vedas and their supplements). However, still others identify their tradition with 'Sanatana Dharma', the eternal order of conduct that transcends any specific body of sacred literature. Scholars sometimes draw attention to the caste system as a defining feature, but many Hindus view such practices as merely a social phenomenon or an aberration of their original teachings. Nor can we define Hinduism according to belief in concepts such as karma and samsara (reincarnation) because Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists (in a qualified form) accept this teaching too.\nAlthough it is not easy to define Hinduism, we can say that it is rooted in India, most Hindus revere a body of texts as sacred scripture known as the Veda, and most Hindus draw on a common system of values known as dharma.\nHinduism originated around the Indus Valley near the River Indus in modern day Pakistan.\nAbout 80% of the Indian population regard themselves as Hindu.\nMost Hindus believe in a Supreme God, whose qualities and forms are represented by the multitude of deities which emanate from him.\nHindus believe that existence is a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, governed by Karma.\nHindus believe that the soul passes through a cycle of successive lives and its next incarnation is always dependent on how the previous life was lived.\nThe main Hindu texts are the Vedas and their supplements (books based on the Vedas). Veda is a Sanskrit word meaning 'knowledge'. These scriptures do not mention the word 'Hindu' but many scriptures discuss dharma, which can be rendered as 'code of conduct', 'law', or 'duty'\nHindus celebrate many holy days, but the Festival of Lights, Diwali is the best known.\nThe 2001 census recorded 559,000 Hindus in Britain, around 1% of the population.", "hours": 32.4, "user_id": "76561198242946802", "username": "Bubblebor", "products": 29, "found_funny": 12, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 11, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-23", "text": "Assassin's Creed 3. Technically the 5th game in the main series, but I guess since they didn't want Ezio being the protagonist in a title called \"AC3\" they gave the previous 2 games subtitles instead of AC3. Anyways, this game was released in 2012 and is considered by a lot to be the \"worst Assassin's Creed game\" along with Unity and Syndicate. Do I think that? well lets see.\nThe story begins with Haytham Kenway obtaining a key by killing an assassin in an opera house, he then travels to America to find the precursor site which can be opened with the key. He comes across other Templars such as Thomas Hickey, Charles Lee, John Pitcairn, William Johnson and Benjamin Church. Haytham realises the key doesn't open the precursor site, so they move onto other things. During Haytham's journey, he meets a native american woman called Ziio, who he marries and has a child with. That child is none other than the assassin advertised for the game, Connor Kenway. Who at a young age watches his mother and village burn because of Charles Lee. Connor is sent to train with Achilles, who we know is exiled in his own house after the events of Assassin's Creed Rogue. Connor is trained and fights for the freedom of America and his own native people. He is tasked in stopping Haytham and all the other Templars. He prevents William Johnson from taking land off of Connor's people, John Pitcairn from killing generals, Thomas Hickey from killing George Washington and Benjamin Church from stealing supplies. During his journey he comes across Haytham and tries to form a truce between Assassins and Templars, however this is stopped when Connor finds out that George Washington, the man who Connor has saved countless times, was actually the one responsible for destroying Connor's village and killing his mother and was about to try again. Connor no longer works with George and soon after, kills Haytham after searching for Charles. Charles Lee, knowing he can't escape Connor, lets himself be killed. At this point, Achilles has also died and Connor just sort of stops doing anything after his people are driven out, the assassins are still gone, meaning Connor failed. There's not much to talk about for Connor, but honestly, unlike the other AC games, this relies heavily on the modern day story. So lets talk about that.\nAfter waking up from a coma, Desmond uses the apple to open the precursor site that Ezio had shown him in a memory, which happens to be the same site Haytham was looking for. So Desmond uses Connor's memories to search for the key which Haytham had. However they also need to find batteries to power up the temple. Desmond finds these in Brazil and Manhattan, however another is found in Egypt but Desmond's father, William, goes to find it. While this happens, William is captured by Abstergo Industries who demand the Apple in return for William Miles. Desmond goes back to Abstergo and kills Warren Vidic (which btw is the best thing ever because that old git has been\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665me off since AC1). They return, power up the temple then Desmond is left with a choice. Either save the world from ending by sacrificing himself, but releasing Juno or letting the world burn and he would survive and start the population again. If Desmond let option 2 happen, he would become like a prophet, his words would be used for wisdom, then violence, sorta like religion today, where peaceful words are sometimes used to justify murder. Desmond chooses to sacrifice himself since option 2 is just letting 7 billion people die. Desmond dies, the end. What do I think of this game? its an amazing final chapter of the Desmond saga and finally closes a story which began in AC1 with Desmond, Lucy and Altair, expanded with Ezio and now finally closes with Connor. This game has been out for 5 years and I still think its quite good in terms of story.\nThe gameplay has changed compared to the typical AC1-ACR gameplay that we've had for a while... and its not really the best, it can sometimes be finnicky and the naval combat in this game is absolutely \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, I would have more to say about the gameplay, but by this time, they've already perfected this style of gameplay with AC4 Black Flag and AC Rogue.\nThe music is absolutely fantastic. We no longer have Jesper Kyd composing the music, but Lorne Balfe, who helped Jesper Kyd with the AC Revelations soundtrack, and they've done a great job in making some of the most memorable AC music in a long time.\nSo how does this game hold up after 5 years? pretty damn well, its probably my 5th favourite AC game, purely for its story, I think this game gets a lot of unnecessary hate. Connor is hated because he's \"boring\" however I think this is because people had a hard time letting go of Ezio and Altair, since they had been in several games and you pretty much played through their entire lives. But I like Connor, he's interesting and has one of the most depressing stories. When this game ends, its not happy at all. He loses everything, his friends, his parents and his people. Its a shame Ubisoft gave him a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665death which was leaked in Unity or something. I will admit the cities are really boring in this game compared to what we got in AC2 or Brotherhood. But other than that and the slow start to the story, this game is great and is definitely up there with some of the other great AC games. Its definitely one of the games which started the fall of AC though. If I were you, I'd buy this in a sale. I got it for \u00a37.", "hours": 11.0, "username": "Alta\u00efr", "products": 59, "early_access": false}

I love the alternate history approach.  I love how vibrant and alive the cities and countrysides feel.  And I admit that for the majority of Assassins's Creed III, I was entertained (hence the thumbs up).\nBut there were some really frustrating elements.  Completely unlikeable main characters (the bad guys are far far more interesting than the good guys), zero emotional connection to Conner, long periods of traversing through the frontier to get from one place to another, the absence of parkour missions, a system of economics that is irrelvant to the game and can be safely ignored.\nThe best missions were the peg leg trinket missions (not finding the trinkets, but the missions you would get after finding a certian number of them).  These missions were interesting and mysterious.  But they were few and far between.\nThe combat has always perturbed me about the AC games.  Ezio could take on a limitless number of enemies.  Why would anybody attack him?  Wouldn't he get a reputation of being an invicinble bad-a$$ and frighten away all the guards?  Instead, they attack him like pigs to the slaughter.  ACIII makes combat harder, which is good.  It was still my preferred approach to most missions where stealth wasn't mandated, but it was definitely more challenging.  Also, the kill animations are especially entertaining.\nBuy it on sale... it's worth it.

The combat system is decent, for reference look up the Patriot with Mel Gibson when he pulls out his tomahawk, its the same. However the story is great that is if you are not from the U.K. Conner teams up with George Washington, Ben Franklin and many other familar Founding Fathers to help drive the British off of our (sorry American talking) new nation. This game holds a special place in my heart because it feels like you are fighting in your own back yard and when you win its satisfying. Now as for the character story, its basically Star Wars, I'm not kidding look it up on youtube, its Star Wars. Beat for beat it follows the Wars mythos to a fault. In all its not terrible but it if you are an American who loves his/her own history. Pick up a copy, its really worth, espically for the DLC Campaign which is beyond cool.

I'm a little late to playing it, it's been sitting in my library for 2 years but I finally got around to it. The story is amazing and the whole concept around the game is by far my favorite of all the Assassins creed games. My only issue is how buggy it can be. The random glitches during missions here and there had me screaming and punching my desk. Re-doing a mission over and over and over again because he either climbs in the wrong spot or just all together would stop moving or not do what I'm trying to do. Random civilians fall through the map. Riding a horse was probably the most challenging thing to do in the game sometimes. I could go on and on about glitches this game has, and there's a lot, however that seems to be with every assassins creed on PC, so I blame ubisoft. The game also has a lot of running back and fourth between the frontier, boston, and new york, and it got annoying to finish a mission only to have to run all the way across the map to get to the next one, and then back across the map for the one after that, but at the same time it was nice finding different ways to get around the forests by tree tops. If you look past the bugs and glitches, this game is amazing. The story line is amazing and always made me want to keep playing. Even after the main story line there are epiloque quests and A LOT of sidequests. For a completionist, it would be almost annoying, but for someone like me who just wants to play the game and get sucked into it, assassins creed 3 did the job.

However, I was slightly disappointed at the same time.\nYou are Ratonhnhake:ton, (yeah, and this will be the only time I will use his actual name in my review) son of a Mohawk mother and an English father in a crucial time in history. The American Colonies are up in arms, angered by the British Parliament's act in imposing taxes without the consent of the colonies. The American Revolution has begun. However, Connor, finds his home indangered by this. As a group of Templars prepare to seize his home in their search for a Precursor site, Connor sets out to join the Brotherhood of Assassins to eliminate those who plan to seize his home and drive his people out. In doing so, he will find himself playing a huge part in history, and will become a key witness to the birth of a New Nation based on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nFirst off, I LOVE this AC game, it has by far has one of the best settings in the whole franchise; the American Revolution. Now I love history, and this game is filled with history about one of the most unique historical moments in human history. The gameplay is fun, with fluid combat gameplay, a good hunting and loot economy, and a beautifully executed naval warfare gameplay. However, that doesn't mean it has it flaws, first off, the story. You will spend one fifth of the game not even as Connor, but his father instead has he sails to the Colonies from England (to be honest though, I really liked Haytham Kenway, so that's a pro within a con). Second, you won't even become an Assassin until you're nearly halfway through the game. Third, the story sadly doesn't make great use of the setting it takes place in, sure you'll meet historic faces and participate in the beginning of the Revolution, but then you'll suddenly go do something that simply make the freaking REVOLUTIONARY WAR nothing more than a background. The first half of the story is nicely done, but then it starts to get rushed and sort of skips events and people that could've been a juicy oppurtunity for an awesome experience.\nThe gameplay would overtime get repetative, but that's more when you finish the story and granted free-roam. When I first got this game, I couldn't wait to participate in the American Revolutionary War and fight in the battles alongside the Continental Army against the British, like what was presented in the commercials, I met people like Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and even the Marquis de Lafayette, but then, you would only participate in three quick, linear, very limited battles. You would spend more time riding around, retreating, or sneaking around rather than fighting. So yeah, rather dissappointing when you see the trailers before you play this game.\nDespite that, it still is very fun and Connor is not the best protagonist, but if you take the time to accomplish side missions and engage in the interactive conversations, you'll actually get to learn more about him and find his character to be more solid and present than you expected. Although, he could've had a better voice actor. I won't give spoilers away so, if you want to know what happens in the story and how the Desmond storyline will end, play this.

Both earlier and later games did a better job with that. The game is also not very good with sticking to corners, often sticking when you want to stand near them, or awkwardly humping walls you want to hide against to assassinate someone. The key to move a body is on the same key as to loot, and only sometimes seems to show up, and the tutorial also prompts \"r\" to reload, which only brings up the weapon select screen and then automatically makes you drop your picked up weapon. Even the assassination doesn't feel too smooth, as it automatically happens around corners rather than being timed with an additional key press, which can cause some irritating moments in gameplay.\nThe story so far is good, though several hours in, and I have not seen anything of this native american assassin the game totes as it's main feature.", "hours": 10.0, "username": "Jynxed", "products": 251, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I had fun when I wasn't wandering miles across the Frontier, Boston, and New York hunting down treasure, or just plain hunting game for cash.  The story sections were full of intrigue and curiosity, and it was interesting to see how Conner adjusted to his half-arsed assassin's trainin gand induction.  The Aquilla ship sections were an absolute BLAST, the  homestead characters were well portrayed, and I've never felt quite so useful playing the Desmond scenes in the game.\nThat said, the game is SUCH a slog for completionists.  Feathers, Treasures, Leaflets, hunting trophies, special kill scenarios, and just to\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665you off, they let you know about completion aspects that you often cant complete for 2-7 sequences.  The last Frontiersman mission literally forces you to beat the game and load into post-game play before you can complete it.  They completely wasted the Underground, and made it the most INCONVENIENT quick travel unlock imaginable.  Cliff climbing was the most satisfying parkour in the game, but it was generally so far out of range of anything of use,  that most of what you end up climibn is 2 story buildings and trees which barely sate the need for a pulse pounding eagle-dive.\nOn top of that, the ending really feels like they just didn't know how to finish up the Desmond arc and tacked on an ending for the giggles.\nThe one redemption after finishing my completion is that the Tyranny of King Washington was actually an immensely fun variant of the game to play.  I wish they had streamlined the main campaign and given some of the additional powers to Conner.  That DLC is the only reason I'm walking away from ACIII with any shred of positivity.\nSo, if you want to wrap up the Desmond Arc and get that Altair Light (because thinking about it, Conner does remind me of Altair) out of the way before moving on to Prequels, rogues, and back to Europe, by all means, give it a go.

Out of those titles, AC III is my favorite by far, with AC 4 fairly close behind.\nI really enjoyed the historic aspect of the game.  I am sure that liberties have been taken, but seeing the possible interior of an Trans-Atlantic vessel of the period was very interesting.  Was it an accurate representation?  Who knows, but it was cool to see and walk around.  I liked the fighting mechanics tremendously better than the previous releases.  If you get a War Tomahawk or Good Sword and combo it with the Rope Dart, you END fights very quickly.  If you grew up outside of the big-city and enjoy hunting, you can go hunting as much as you like, but watch out for the bears, cougars, bobcats, wolves, and occasional enemy patrols!  The ship battles at sea were a gas as well.  The battles in AC 4 were much better though, but these are still enjoyable.  An occasional bug still will get you from time to time, thankfully, they are very rare.\nThe biggest thing that drives me crazy with this and all the other AC games that I have played are the restrictions for a mission.  It seems like they put them in to extend the game as you usually keep replaying the part until you get the 100%, that can be a bit of a drag at times, especially with old systems.  At least they mostly ditched the timed obstacle courses from the previous releases which was very welcome imho.\nI know this game took alot of guff from the botched release and being familiar with UBI and their ridiculous philosophy and attitude towards their customers, sadly, it does nto surprise me at all, but they do seem to have cleaned most of the problems up now.\nI would definitely recommend this game, especially for the history buffs.

Coming off the very successful Ezio Trilogy, with its charming protagonist and colourful Mediterranean romps, to this, where you play as a moody teen in a downbeat tale of dashed hopes and broken promises...it's a hell of a transition. I don't blame people for feeling let down.\nBut for me, that's one of its strengths. A series only survives as long as Assassin's Creed has done by constantly trying new things, and this game is that attitude in abundance. Any effort made to avoid staleness is to be commended, whether it works out or not.\nAnd a lot of what's here does work. The combat mechanics are superb, building on Ezio's combo-kills to new heights of speed and fluidity. The rural setting, with its climable rocks and trees, makes free-running fresh and exciting again, bringing back a vivid sense of...well, freedom, that was perhaps wearing off by this time. And whilst Black Flag makes it feel primitive in retrospect, the naval missions still remain a series highlight.\nBut what I like most is something very simple: this is one of a very few stories, in any medium, to dare criticise George Washington, and the Founding Fathers as a whole. Many countries have a \"founding myth\", but America's is one of the most dominant in global culture, and even now so much of it remains unquestioned. A story that places the Revolution in its fullest historical context - that of the native tribes, the first owners of the land over which the white colonists were squabbling, and to whom the Patriot victory was a disaster - is something that simply doesn't happen often enough, especially in a Triple-A title like this.\nThat being said, ACIII does have its shortcomings. Even I'm not blind to that. It's obvious that the studio were working under a tight deadline, and the larger-than-usual portion of bugs and glitches is testament to that. The story also suffers, ultimately, with both Connor's and Desmond's plots coming to rushed, underwhelming endings, which is a particular shame considering their strong starts.\nPersonally, I'm willing to put that aside. The aspects of this game that work, and they work very well indeed, are more than enough to make up for the aspects that don't.", "hours": 74.0, "username": "MattAppleby", "products": 92, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

If you realize that the story explores the ideological differences between the Templars and the Assassins then it is very easy to love. Should humanity be trusted to chart its own course as the Assasins believe or would it be better off guided by a benevolent firm hand like the Templars believe?\nSome people erroneously seem to think Connor is a one dimensional character but that's because those people likely missed out on the Homestead missions where his motivations are fleshed out. As the game progresses, more and more of the Homestead expands and as the seasons change, more optional conversations open up with characters in his village and elsewhere, all of which demonstrate character development.\nThe gameplay offers a variety of ways for you to utilize your parkour and weapons. You can hunt in the Frontier, collect some feathers and trinkets, rob some convoys, chests, and complete Frontiersman missions. You can run through the cities collecting Almanac pages, trinkets and chests guarded by NPC, as you liberate districts from Templars by helping out the local resistance in their own unique missions. Or you can take to the beautifully rendered high seas and engage in naval combat. The set piece missions are back too as you are tasked to recover Captain Kidd's treasure.\nThe modern day has its moments too. It isn't up to the standards of the main game and was apparently done by the B team so the difference in quality is obviously apparent but the dialogue is still pretty good and the plot points covered provide closure to Desmond's story.", "hours": 101.7, "user_id": "76561198044508357", "username": "tdog", "products": 231, "early_access": false}

I cannot for certain state that this game is terrible, because it isn't, but it has so many flaws, it makes the game hard to like, even for someone who has played and enjoyed nearly every other Assassin's Creed game.\nTo start with, Connor is largely uninteresting, which is shocking, because he had the potential to be the coolest assassin ever. I mean, a Mohawk native turned assassin, how could that possibly be boring. Well, when the character is introduced to us by playing hide and seek with his friends, that's a pretty good way to make them boring. It takes seemingly forever to get to a point where you ever start to do assassin like things, and even then, the game still feels largely boring.\nThe bugs, oh my, the bugs. Assassin's Creed games are largely plagued by bugs, but this takes it to a new level. From the horses getting stuck on things causing you to eventually abandon them and continue on foot, to things not appearing on the map, including entire city locations, to game breaking bugs that delete your save game, this game suffers from bugs. In my most recent playthrough, I experienced this bug, causing my save game to be deleted. Considering I was nearly finished with trying to complete the game with almost 100% sync, I was upset.\nThe lack of explanation of in game missions and collectables is mind numbingly annoying. The first time I played through the game, I never unlocked the best weapons and equipment, simply because I had no idea what I needed to do to get it. Eventually, I figured it out, but it certainly was annoying. Same with the assassin recruits. Although the most egregious example of lack of explanation is the \u201cPivot Points\u201d. I still do not understand what to do with these. They aren\u2019t even available until after you complete the game, and honestly once I get to that point, I am done playing, and really have little interest to try to figure it out.\nThe modern day stuff, as usual, is boring. This one may be the worst examples of the modern day content in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, since it really pulls me out of the game the most, and features long, un-skippable content that tries to explain the bizarre connection to these ancient people that is talked about in nearly every game, but is largely unsatisfying. The ending itself is definitely unsatisfying, but I will not elaborate to avoid spoilers.\nAll in all, I really can only recommend this game to people who are hardcore fans of the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, or really want a game set during the American Revolution, but for most, I would encourage you to stay away. If you want that feeling of early colonial America in your game, check out Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue. Otherwise, if you just want a fun Assassin\u2019s Creed game and don\u2019t really care about colonial America, play Assassin\u2019s Creed Black Flag. Both of these are far more enjoyable experiences.", "hours": 185.1, "username": "techgeek1994", "products": 306, "early_access": false}

The game is pretty good for something that came out in 2012. The story is alright. To be honest I'm more interested in Conner's dad the main antagonist.

I know that some their actions are pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, but I'm sure the assassins do just as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 thing also.

If you're playing this on PC, you need a controller.\nI'm serious.\nThe dev's even said when this was being developed that PC players would require a controller to play it properly.\nLet me give you a few examples of why you need a controller.\n1. Parkour is ridiculous with a keyboard/mouse setup. You can't climb trees and you cant hang onto anything really. Not sure why, but apparently you need a controller to do this.\n2. Combat is a bit wonky, moving the camera around while fighting can be very slow.\n3. The layout and controls of the game in general on keyboard and mouse just leave much to be desired.\nAlso, on PC, there seems to be a pretty popular issue, where the screen freaks out and shakes uncontrollaby whenever you do anything in the game. I'm not sure if a controller itself fixes it, but if you make Uplay launch in offline mode while playing it, it works perfectly.\nTL;DR\nI adore this game, it's so much fun, and it makes me sad that I cannot replay it unless I buy a controller.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 27, "page_order": 2, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-09-24", "text": "I really wish I could give this game a positive review, as I love the AC franchise, but it's just got too much wrong with it. Details below.\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\nGameplay and controls 1/10:  After taking almost a full two-and-a-half games to really get a hang of the controls, and then enjoying one game where I finally had them down without having to worry about it, this game had such a major overhaul of the combat system that it made it almost impossible for me to play without dying multiple times whenever I had to fight my way out of a situation. Not only do you have to time everything just perfectly, but then you can't just counterattack and have the game choose which counter works best against which enemy like in the previous games. No. You have to hit one of three keys for a different counter attack each time, which means that if you think you're countering one enemy, but you're actually countering another and choose the wrong counter on accident, you're going to get hurt bigtime. Combat in this game is absolutely horrid. Besides that, your health/synchronization does not regenerate until you are done with a fight, at which point it all magically reappears. I totally get that, unlike AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, there wasn't really any reliable \"medicine\" you could purchase on the American Frontier, so that wouldn't make sense in the gameplay for this installment; but at least in the first AC game your synchronization would rebuild if you were able to hold off any direct hits from your enemies. Here, even if you block attacks that damage your health, you're still stuck with a bar that doesn't refill, making it much easier to die, and you have no way to refill it at all. To me, that's just a time waster. I've never cursed so much while playing a  game, and I don't even curse that much in my day-to-day life. In addition to this, the menu that you are forced to use to select your weapons and such is clunky and not useful at all. In previous games, it was a snap to select your weapon from either numbered hotkeys or the quick-select wheel. They tried to streamline it, I believe for non-PC/controller players, but ended up screwing over those of us who play with mouse/keyboard. The other thing that drove me nuts? The fact that you can no longer just run. You must either walk or sprint. This may sound great until you realize that sprinting past guards in certain ***unmarked*** areas (not redzones or anything, just random areas in the cities), even if you are not notorious or even on a level where enemies will detect you, will cause them to start chasing after you and trying to kill you. Even on horseback, you end up having to trot most of the time, which isn't much faster than walking on foot, because you simply run into too much in the cities while cantering. Therefore, you must walk through large sections of the cities, making traveling in this game extraordinarily tedious. I also never used the investment system for the homestead because there was no benefit that I could see, nor did I ever upgrade my weapons past the first two times because it made no difference in the difficulty or ease of combat. It  was just a pointless leftover from the previous games. The only part I really enjoyed about the gameplay was the addition of nautical battles, at which I ended up being surprisingly adept.\nGraphics 6/10:  The graphics were pretty good, as usual for an AC game, but the extraneous characters and objects (horses, wildlife, citizens, etc.) were actually considerably less developed than the previous games. I felt like they had put a nicely animated main character back in the animations from the first AC game. It felt out of place. And, while traveling through the Italian countryside in AC II felt like you were actually moving through some beautiful country, traveling through the wilderness in this game actually felt more like traveling through the forest of two-dimensional foliage. There was no beauty to appreciate or enjoy, really, because it was all trees and the trees were not that pretty. Overall, graphics were much more disappointing than any other previous AC games.\nStoryline 5/10:  While they really tried to tie this into the American Revolution in a realistic way, I feel they unfortunately failed. Whereas I enjoyed the stories in the other games and loved the history they used to weave their tale into, this one just felt like I was slogging through the life story of someone who lived during the American Revolution and worked a lot behind the scenes, but ended up just having everything always go against them. It was actually rather depressing. At least the history was pretty accurate, though, in terms of the sequence of the war itself, so that made things a little better.\nCharacters 2/10:  I honestly can't think of any one character in this game that I really like. Not Connor, not Achilles, not Haytham, not any of the founding fathers of America or associated men and women. Nobody. Okay, maybe the goofy Irish lumberjacks who provide some comic relief on two occasions, but literally no one else comes to mind as a character that made me enjoy playing the game. I found Haytham to be interesting at first, even if he was very stiff, and he actually provided the one great comic moment in the entire game; but he still wasn't a character that I really *liked*. Playing through the game as Connor has made me want to slap his creators upside the head on multiple occasions because it's like playing as an angsty, angry teenager who never matures. I mean, literally, Connor's two forms of speaking are an annoying monotone when he's trying to act all calm and bad***, or shouting when something doesn't go like he planned and he gets angry. There is no nuance -- no middle ground. He is like the bad, cliched stereotype of the Native Americans combined with your worst nightmare teenage son. And he doesn't change as the years go by in this game. At least Ezio Auditore, in AC II, had some slight personality changes over the years. Even though the animation didn't change, you could tell by his voice acting and the way in which he'd handle situations that he wasn't the brash young teenager that he started out as. There is no such change in Connor. He is a static, boring character, as are all the rest of the characters in this game.\nOverall Rating 3/10:  If you want to play this game just to finish out the next chapter of the Desmond storyline, by all means do so; but you could probably read about that aspect of the story online without having to subject yourself to the torture which is this game, its awkward controls, boring storyline, two-dimensional characters, and overall unsatisfying experience. I slogged through the game just because a) I'm stubborn and don't like giving up on a story once I've started it, and b) I actually thought that the game couldn't really be *that* bad even though I had heard that AC players in general didn't like it. But I will never replay it, unlike the other games which I would actually enjoy going back to.\n*Side note: Also, where were the canoes??? I was really looking forward to being able to use one only to find that the feature had been cut from the final game. Lame! The gondolas were really fun and useful in the previous games, and I was so bummed that we weren't going to get to use anything remotely resembling a boat in this game.", "hours": 40.0, "username": "samara_dubhlainn", "products": 20, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

You can redownload it by accessing a beta branch of the game, search the forums for info. Ubi is probably going to patch it officially soon anyway, though.\nThe game is good, AC3 redefines climbing, nature and introduces wildlife hunting and sea battles on ships. I did like the american natives setting, but the colonial wars stressed me a bit.\nAlso the game is a bit confusing sometimes and I am not talking about the story, but about some game-mechanics. For example, I actually still havent figured the trading over a distance at the merchant, should read a guide I guess. No, I am not new to the series if that is what you think.\nIf you enjoy Asassin's Creed and like to play a powerful american native asassain at the colonial wars you should get this one. If you are new, I still think AC2 is the perfect start.

You'll spend hours playing this game before you even get to play the actual protagonist. This might not be for everyone, but if you love games with an immersive atmosphere, you definitely have to jump into this interpretation of the American Revolution. The snowy landscapes are one of the most beautiful and memorable things I've seen in my history of gaming.\nDon't expect this game to be perfect, the main character is lacking any distinctive image or personality, the frame story is negligible at best and the AI is as terrible as it has always been in the AC series. BUT. The atmosphere is freaking amazing and the action-filled gameplay is pretty cool. Jumping and climbing through the woods of this huge open world is a lot of fun.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 33, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "text": "Assassin's Creed 3 is the fifth game in the Assassin's Creed series (Even though it has a '3'), a series known for its amazing characters, fun combat, and historic settings. How does AC 3 compare to the rest of the series? Well, let's take a look. The setting for this one is the Revolutionary War in North America. You follow Connor Kenway as he discovers what being in the Assassin Brotherhood is all about and seeks revenge. It's up to Connor to take down the Templar Order sect set up in North America. The story presented in this one is definitely fun, although not the best in the series, it still does a good job. Also, there are a couple of twists thrown in to mix things up (and one of them is amazing!)\nNow, let's talk about Connor for a moment. Connor is the WORST character in the entire franchise! He's nothing like Ezio at all! (Only joking). All jokes aside, Connor is different than Ezio, which is good. We don't need an Ezio every single time, and an original character is better than an Ezio clone (*cough* *Arno* *cough*). If you want to like Connor, accept him for who he is and understand where he's coming from, and don't compare him to Ezio. Connor is a little of an acquired taste, but if you pay attention to the story, you'll understand him and appreciate him. I'm not saying that he's the best character, but he's still a good one. He's serious and a stone cold killer, willing to anything short of breaking the creed to get to his goals.\u00a0\nWithout spoiling anything, there is another playable character in the game, Haytham. Haytham is an absolutely amazing character, and an interesting one at that. The short time you spend with him is time well spent. There are plenty of other characters in the game as well, such as Charles Lee, Lafayette, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and the man himself, General George Washington. Except for a few annoying characters, all of the characters are great, well-written, and well voiced. \u00a0\nThere are definitely some big changes from this game and the ones before. First off, the combat has been changed. You still have countering and stealth kills, but the combat feels different. There are parts where it slows down and provides brutal kills. The slowing down is pretty cool, but sometimes it can get annoying. The style in which Connor fights in is different from what we've seen before. This is best left for you to discover. An Assassin's Creed game wouldn't be the same without its weapons, and there are plenty of new weapons to explore. This is the first AC game with firearms (well, besides the wrist pistol in the Ezio games). There are various flintlock pistols, as well as rifles. They take a solid 3 seconds to reload, so they're not the quickest things, but they're deadly. Other new weapons include rope darts, which allow you to hang enemies, drag them off of rooftops, and pull them close. A bow has been added as well, which allows for a more silent and faster ranged kill. Connor's main melee weapon, a tomahawk, also deals a lot of damage and is probably one of the most brutal weapons in the game. Also included with the game are familiar weapons like swords, spears, and of course, the two iconic hidden blades.\u00a0\nWith these weapons in hand, it's time to kill some noobs. There are a small variety of enemies, including snipers, standard redcoats, grenadiers (who wield axes and, well, grenades), commander-type soldiers, who carry a sword and pistol, and fast-acting knivemen. The AI is fairly standard, but are fun to chop down. Something new that's been added in their code is the ability to line up and shoot at you. This also introduces a new mechanic that allows you to block their bullets by using a human shield. I personally though this was a great idea, and it's great to see it being used in later AC games. Besides that, there's not much new with the enemy AI. Oh, and they still can't swim...\nOther new mechanics have been added, such as lock picking. Honestly, lock picking is absolutely terrible, but luckily it only comes up twice in the main campaign. They should've taken a page out of Skyrim's lock picking. A big mechanic that has never been seen before in an AC game until now is naval combat. The naval combat was perfected in Black Flag, but here it needed work. It's decent and fairly enjoyable, but it's definitely been improved. There are a couple of missions in the campaign that utilize this, but it's not used often. You can fire cannons at enemy ships as you sail along the East Coast to get supplies, which can be used to upgrade the ship. The cannons, though, aren't quite as movable as they are in later games.\u00a0Since there is a good portion of frontier in the map, there aren't many rooftops to run across. In fact, the rooftops in the cities are actually pretty well guarded, as if the game designers don't want you to parkour around. A new tree parkour (Or \"Treekour) mechanic has been added. It's pretty great and entertaining and gives us that much needed parkour. Also, rock climbing as been added to the game, for even more climbing action.\u00a0\nThis game is jam-packed with new things, like petting animals! You can also pet wild animals really hard...with blades. Hunting has been throw into the mix to provide you with extra things to do. There's rabbits, wolves (which are hostile), foxes, bears, dear, and more, all waiting for you to kill them. I personally didn't indulge in the hunting (I'm not a hunting person, in real life and in video games), but it definitely adds more entertainment. Once you kill the animal (by either setting traps or killing them with your weapons), you can craft new items with the pelts or sell them for money. Overall, it's a well-made new mechanic and a great edition to the game.\u00a0\nIf you've ever played one of these games, you're familiar with the notoriety system. If you're a newcomer, the notoriety system is just a wanted system. The higher the notoriety, the more aware guards are of you. It's stayed the same throughout the Ezio trilogy so, the creators decided to change it up. Once you have one level of notoriety, when you pass a soldier, they will go after you if you stick around for too long, and it doesn't take much for this to happen. They've made it more likely that you'll be attacked by guards if you even just have one level of it. This can be annoying if all you want to do is complete a mission, or simply get to where you need to go. How do you get rid of this? Well, you can tear down wanted posters to remove 1 level of notoriety, bribe a town crier to remove 2 levels, and bribe a printing press to take away 3 levels. The new ways of removing notoriety definitely spice things up, but the new system of notoriety can get very old very fast.\u00a0\nOther mechanics include fast traveling (without taking a boat) and tunnels to also fast travel in (this time, you actually get to walk through the tunnels). These two mechanics are handy when you're in a hurry to get to your next mission.\u00a0\nSince we've discussed new things that have been added, let's talk about things that have been removed. Armor is no longer in the game, which does make sense considering people usually didn't wear armor in the Revolutionary War. Medicine has been taken out of the game, so you have to heal naturally. Nothing else has been taken away, but it takes some getting used to if you've played the other games first.\u00a0\nIf you're familiar with AC, then you know that there's a modern story that connects with the past. Here, we see Desmond Miles and his group once again, trying to stop the Apocalypse. Say what you will about the previous modern day story, this one is actually pretty darn good! There's some fun moments and the story is actually great.\nIn the end, Assassin's Creed 3 may not be the best AC game, but it's definitely a fun sequel.

A lot of voices saying the series ended on revelations or Black flag is what is better, AC3 is just stupid.\nIt was alll wrong, I loved the game. Let me just say the naval battles are SOOO AWESOMEE, definitely my favourite part of the game aside from the main story of course. Would love to see a multiplayer of that. FULLLLL SAILLLLLL!!!!\nNow going back to the game, it definitely gives you the feeling of passage that you may want from ezio and altair story. It doesn't just starts and all the other games are irrelevant, from others reviews is what  I heard, so if you want to continue on the journey and want more of the story its a must buy, absolutely!\nI really enjoyed the jump to the american revolution and that twist with haytham at the beginning, that was genius and it made me stop the game and only start next day because I had to digest it. Haytham is an amazing charather, I think the best one, Connor is there but is not so strong. Haytham takes the stage.\nThe thing that stood up to me was how the templars and assasins work, with the templars and haytham you get a team together and most missions your working with them and on the opposite side the assasins is mostly a solo job, before the big surprise, I was enjoying the way the assasins worked some centuries after ezio but then ......the surprise. DAMN!!\nMusic is 8/10 like others games althought there is no ezio family or road to masyaf, something that could stand above them all. The magnus, the one to rule them all.\nOne thing I would like to point out, the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing money system. I didn't even bother to upgrade my ship or any weapons, what a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up. If I want to go hunting and spend hours doing so, I will play minecraft or enjoy a beautiful day in the sun hunting or fishing. I may have cursed you guys a few times because of that.\nSo yeah, its totally worth buying it to progress the story. Its a 8/10\nI was sad with the ending but I shall see what they do with the next one, what will they do with it.(if you make his death be just that there will be violence, we shall see!)", "hours": 34.9, "user_id": "76561198293380406", "username": "MaLGooee", "products": 171, "early_access": false}

You can disarm an enemy using a musket, shoot him with it, and repeat that cycle for every gun-weilding man, ...and it's FUN.\nYou couldn't just spam the counter button. You had to approach different enemies in different ways. This gave you an excuse to use the \"more options\" you had. I loved the challenge.\nDeath by the hand of combat hadn't typically happened to me in an AC game since the first one. Usually I die of jumping from rooftops. That still happens to me btw and I'm on the 4th game as of typing this.\nOverall: Fun, challenging, AWESOME!\n5/5\nClimbing is even faster. You can climb trees and rocks at last. I came up with a little quote while playing: \"If it's a rock, Connor can climb it.\" I don't see any possible handholds yet he still climbs up like it's nothing. I'm not complaining, though, I love the freedom of scalable rocks.\nIt is rare if not impossible for you to not be able to scale something. Like buildings or cliffs. They are usually climbable. You can climb onto moving windmills, too, so that's pretty interesting. And this also can lead to your death by gravity and physics. There's no climb leap anymore, so you don't risk jumping to your death. I'm certain some of you know what I mean if you've played the Ezio games.\nLeap of faith is typically without flaw, and escaping by climbing up, not away, is a decent strategy because guards forget how to aim when you're on a vertical surface.\nOverall: Faster and more efficient climbing mechanic, and you can now scale most rocks and trees, but\n3.5/5\nAmazing. I don't have much else to say\n4/5\nbut if you give him a chance, you'll see that he is a very compassionate and emotional person. He cares about people, even if he's just met them, and he shows this caring nature through acts of kindness.\nbut that is just how he gets sh*t done. His naivety can even be funny at times, and I can't help but laugh every time he says \"Where is Charles Lee?!\"\nOverall: While\nI still love Connor. He is emotional, empathetic, and concrete. And sometimes hilarious.\n3/5\nI personally loved the Desmond part of ACIII. In my opinion, it was quite boring to play as Desmond in many of the previous games unless it was story-related. There seemed to be nothing to do but talk to the rest of the team and listen to Shaun's sass.\nBut now you can run around the\nwhere Desmond, Rebecca, Shaun, etc. are staying and explore little bits and pieces related to the\nand do little free-running puzzles in between. The story bits during the modern-day sequences are so hype-filled for me and felt greatly involved and connected with the story.\nOverall: During modern-day, more stuff to do when playing as Desmond+story sequences are full of hype.\n4.5/5\nWhistling, peeking around corners, and hiding in bushes/brush are introduced. It is a great improvement as opposed to previous games' stealth mechanics.\nOverall: The stealth is overall better than in the previous games. A relief, but also possibly a ragequit due to different AI being different\n3.5/5\nEach recruit has a special ability. Some enable you to start a riot, using the anger of the citizens to your advantage and distracting guards. Other abilities include enabling bodyguards who will attack any guards who detect you and having two Assassins disguised as redcoats escort you like a prisoner, allowing you to enter guarded zones without being detected. However,\nbut once I figured it out, all was well.\nOverall: Interesting, but\n3.5/5\nUnlocking zones unlocks keys to chests (I could be wrong), but until then you need to pick the locks, which is a fun little thing to do if you aren't in the heat of battle.\nthough.\n4/5\nYou explore the underground tunnels instead of just using them like in Rome as if you know where everything is before going there. Yet another fun little thing to do when you're not focusing on story, and it benefits you in the end.\n4/5\nFun. Just fun. I'm sure many people agree with that. Which is probably why the next game, Black Flag, was so successful. However\nso be careful.\nOverall: Fun\n4/5\nAlso just plain fun. Can be\nOverall: Fun\n3.5/5\nOverall: Morally-challenging+mindblowing\n4/5\nPersonally, I found it quite amusing to send convoys of items I acquired/crafted in order to make money. Even when I didn't need money, it was still fun to me. However,\n4/5\nI like that some items must be crafted to be acquired. This makes it more challenging and less straightforward. You must gather resources, have the item's recipe, and have the proper level craftsmen to make the item as opposed to simply checking what items are available at shops every time you finish a sequence. However,\nOverall: Confusing+challenging, but it can be fun once you get it\n3.5/5", "hours": 148.1, "compensation": "Product received for free", "user_id": "76561198127618858", "username": "EpicFires", "products": 36, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 42, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-06-18", "text": "What I particularly love about this game is how high the stakes are. This is something completely omitted in the later entries in the series and one of their biggest drawbacks. Two factions in war with each other while an even bigger threat threatens to wipe them both out unless something is done about it. It was the same in the past in the war with the Isu and it's happening again today. It's the same as Game of Thrones in a lot of ways, great lords distracted fighting one another while an apocalyptic threat comes down on them from the north. It's an awesome way to tell a story.\nThe character development for the villains in this game is great, especially Charles Lee who has a real arc from eager apprentice to evil villain. He also has great lines. The rest of the Templar cohort is also fleshed out rather well before you're given the mission to assassinate them and this was well done and got me more invested in the story. The set piece battles are disappointing and too scripted. Nothing in the trailer can actually be done in the game and it's not unfair to judge the gameplay based on promises a trailer makes. The main character is uncharismatic and dull, especially when viewed in contrast to Ezio. If I had to pick the games biggest flaw that would be it. If we don't like the player character and connect with him then what's left? Maybe he showed a bit humanity in the homestead missions but those missions aren't mandatory and it was very brief as well. I like the slow build-up of the game, taking its time to develop the world and the characters within it. I think this is something rarely done in games and I would like to see more of it. But it loses its impact a bit when we don't have a strong protagonist to relate to.\nThe multiplayer cutscenes are interesting in this one because they introduced a concept that would be further explored in the Black Flag. The animus as a gaming console used by Abstergo to control the past. After this game you no longer play as a named character in the present day story but rather as yourself, testing the animus console and even though you start to miss a proper protagonist in the later games the concept in itself is interesting. The overarching plot of the templar's goal of releasing humanity's lost potential denied us by the ancients is also explored here and that's genuinely interesting. I just wish they would do more with it in the later installments of the series.\nThe tailing mission in the \"Justice Served\" section of The Tyranny of King Washington warrants special mention because it was excellent. All throughout the mission you have to use wolf cloak to stay hidden but you can't use it for too long so you have to look for hiding spots to regain health and there are dogs that smell you along the way so you have to use bait to throw them off. I was never bored during this mission and in a series famous for its boring tailing missions this was truly exceptional. The DLC introduces a series of abilities that affect the meta of the game in several interesting ways and I think it's a very well done expansion. Plus Robin Atkin Downes gives a great performance as Washington and it's always cool to see him in games.\nI like the tomahawk quite a lot, it replaced the sword for me in this one because it feels better and more thematically appropriate to use. It handles kind of like the butcher knife in previous games only cooler and more brutal. I found the bow a lot more viable than the crossbow as well because of its thematic importance to the character but also the setting. That and with the new dart arrow you feel like such a badass predator hunting redcoats. Even if the new combat system was a bit simplified I still enjoyed it.\n\nSadly the game is not without its bugs this time around either, such as NPC's scripting breaking on occasion, causing you to have to reload a checkpoint and and it even snowed indoors once. Although this is annoying I didn't mind as much as I did in Brotherhood and Revelations because of this game's bigger scope. And at least the hidden blade hits the head instead of the air next to it this time. One particularly amusing episode was when I was avoiding guards with Sam Adams and I decided to kill some guards blocking the way to get to my destination faster and while I'm mowing down dozens of redcoats like some native American terminator Sam Adams is yelling \"Leave him alone! He's just a child. He's done nothing wrong!\"\n\nI'm one of those people who read all of the database entries as I'm playing the game and through playing the series it's gotten me interested in history in a big way. There are literally dozens of us! The database is written by Shaun in the lore of the game and he always adds little jokes and snarky comments directed at Desmond and as an extension, us the player, and this has fallen away in further installments after the third game. Though they're still interesting they don't have the same charm to them but I'm glad they brought it back in Syndicate.\n\nI loved building up the homestead and doing missions for the settlers. It fits the theme of building a new life in a new country and I've always liked having a strong home base in open world games like this. One you enjoy coming back to. It's almost as good as Monteriggioni in Assassin's Creed 2. By the time this game came out Black Flag was well into production and the addition of the naval missions was not only a smart move to prepare us for that game and tie the two of them together more closely but it's also one of the most fun activities in the game. I was surprised to see so many clues to the two next games in the series, several references to the French Revolution and talk of unity between assassins and templars and Connors grandfather and his pirate roots.\n\nGame developers, when you walk along with an NPC to a specific destination and there's a conversation happening, please don't make it so the conversation is cut short because you arrived at the destination too fast! This happens more than once in this game and it's absolutely infuriating. And it's not like I was running to get there as fast as I could, no I was walking slowly next to the NPC. There should be a law against this type of game design. Make it so the conversation doesn't last any longer than the time it takes to get to the destination via the fastest route taken. I hate missing out on plot like this and it made me restart missions because of it. I also don't like the horse for the most part. It's more cumbersome than convenient to use most of the time, especially in the frontier with the amount of obstacles in your way and the lack of a stamina meter for your horse which means you can't maximize your speed.\n\nYour assassin recruits have personalities this time which is great. I loved calling in Stephane to help me out in a scrap. You can also choose between different abilities in your recruits depending on the situation, sniping or assassinating or rioting. I love this and it's a great development of an already good system. Because of their personalities and the nature of the story, fighting a revolution, I was more interested in sending them out on missions in the mini game that's been featured in every game since Brotherhood. The ability to do it from a menu and not having to go to a pigeon coop to send them was very convenient and made me want to do it more.\n\nI like history so i didn't find the game or the story particularly boring but genuinely interesting and I loved learning about the American Revolution through this game. The game also showed us the first and last instance of something I've always wanted to see: modern day assassin gameplay. It's such a shame they didn't explore this further because fighting modern day enemies with a hidden blade was a lot of fun despite how brief it was. I believe the game to be underrated and though some of the criticism towards it is merited I still hold it in high esteem.", "hours": 58.0, "username": "Danny Rodriguez", "products": 190, "early_access": false}

Later on you will then be controlling Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton (Ra-doon-han-ge-don.) who is a Native American and the direct descendent of haytham kenway, who you will later on through the game find out who he really is, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton is interested in becoming an assassin and so he sets out of his village to learn the true ways of the assassin.\nEven though this is the 3rd installment of the assassins creed franchise, i don't think i missed anything that i couldve understood the story better with from the 1st or 2nd game (Keep in mind this is my first game coming into the assassins creed franchise). The combat is fluid and simple, yet complex at times. It's easy to learn but its extremely fun to master.\nThere are alot of ways you can approach enemies, you can go in \"Antique-Guns\" Blazing, you can take it slow and stealthy Or you can be a predator and kill your enemies in varied ways (you can hang enemies from a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing tree branch).\nThe visuals are pretty good for a game made in 2012, the ambient occlussion realistically maps out the shadows and lighting smoothly and beautifully, the texture quality is excellent and i fail to find a distorted texture anywhere, this game is made on an engine designed by ubisoft called Anvil, and it might just be the best looking game on the engine!\nThe dlcs are a bit pricey and they dont deliver an excellent story, I haven't bought them and i am satisfied with the game's ending as it is.\nThe game has a multiplayer, it's fun tactical.

It has alot of trophies and collectibles that are a chore to find, but wont hurt the game.\nAnd one of my favourite parts of the game is the Homestead!\nThe Homestead is a place where later on in the game you will own,  as you progress further through the game you gain more people living in your homestead until it is eventually a village, you can even do missions with the villagers! Complete with their own cutscenes and stories to tell.\nThe game's price is just right for a game this good but you can definetely find cheaper prices on G, 2, A or Green Man Gaming.\nThe game has done excellent on optimiziation, it has never crashed a single time and i fail to find any game breaking glitches or bugs.\nOverall, i would give this game an 8/10\nThe game builds everything up perfectly, there are places where it excelled with flying colours, but there are places it couldv'e done better at and there are places where it fell flat on its face.

I've seen lockpicking in a lot of games, but Assassin's Creed III does the worst job of pulling it off.

I think everyone egrees though that you could lose pretty much all of the modern day and alien story and stay in the historical setting. AC has learned this down the line, and AC3 is really the culmination of the series-spanning Precursor storyline.\nThe Flaws:\nThe game takes FOREVER to truly get started. You only see the title credits an hour into the game, and you have to play an entirely different character from the protagonist for the first 3-4 hours as well. While this works as an excellent story mechanic and (a slightly longwided) tutorial session, it falls flat when you have to RELEARN the same things the game has just taught you (like how to shop, etc) when you advance to the main protagonist. This feels like BAD EDITING rather than anything else, as if nobody really sat back and lined up all the storyline cards and asked 'Is four hours of following an ally who's on rails actually fun for a player wanting to get into Assassin's Creed?' Once the meat of the plot kicks off though the game comes into its own.\nThe voice acting is pretty shoddy in some cases (yet somehow flawless in others - looking at you, expertly acted Charles Lee.) Mostly it's the Native American language which sounds stilted and confused a lot of the time. One elderly native seems to have a very young woman's voice with a very strange way of drawing out her sentences. I've also heard three different ways that the natives pronounce our protagonist's colloquial name (which I won't bother attempting to spell here.) It was a nice ATTEMPT at plunging the player into the Native American culture but in the end it fell short - being poorly executed.\nThe old AC fundamental flaw of poor controls. Too many times will Connor launch the wrong direction off a roof or leg it down the streets of Boston or New York, only to opt to jump on top of a table and pause for the view while the enemy is in hot pursuit. If you've played AC before, you'll know the drill and you learn to ignore it.\nThe GREAT BITS!!!\nThe graphics of Assassin's Creed really began to come into their own with AC3. The wild Frontier is varied and beautiful (save in some places an odd over-abundance of smoke/mist, wind-floating leaves, and specularities which make it look like Connor could be under water. Don't try TOO hard Ubisoft.)\nThe city and frontier design is great and it's a fun challenge trying to get from one place to another without your feet hitting the ground.\nThe plot (while slow to take off) is nicely driven and there's a nice variety of characters. A common complaint is that people don't like the main character Connor. I too think he's a complete asshat, but I have no complaints about this. I don't expect everyone in MY ancestry to be a charming Ezio or a smouldeirngly silent Altair. Connor's whining, shouting, and immaturity mirrors those who are complaining about him.\nThe naval gameplay (while still taking off - leading to arguably one of the best games in the franchise AC:Black Flag) was a lovely implementation and I'm glad it was used sparingly enough for Ubisoft to learn from it and make it better in AC4.\nThere's so much to do in AC3 that you'll never get around to all of it. I'm not sure how many people actually play the sidegames offered on a varity of street corners, or chase every one of Benjamin Franklin's lost almanac pages, but there's always plenty to do in the New World.\nCombat is smooth and satisfying and it's great to see Connor's own emotive reactions on his face while he porks a tomahawk into a redcoat's back. You feel powerful and skilled even early on in the game.\nWe've all wanted a game where we can play as a Native American fighting back against the influx of Europeans in the 'New World' (whether we realise it or not) I'm glad AC took up this mantle and made a game out of it.\nI reccommend AC3, particularly to those who are a fan of the franchise, but also to the patient few who are looking for an expansive adventure into the past and are willing to plow through a few hours of hand-holding first.\nAnd as always with Ubisoft - don't look directly at the bugs.", "hours": 53.8, "user_id": "76561198036174698", "username": "ViveLaPluto", "products": 134, "early_access": false}

I've played about twice the time on my Xbox-360 awhile back when the game was free for a couple of weeks. There isn't much of a difference other than a tinge better graphics, but that's about it. Combat is nothing special apart from any other AC game, what I've leant of the story, it's basically another case of hit or miss and this certainly is a miss. Though truth be told, keeping up with the AC storyline is fairly easy, even if you skip an installment. Go play AC-2 or Black Flag, their gimmicks are better. To add onto that, the same near outrageous amount of collectables strewn across maps where it feels the game is inflated with collectables haunts this series in general. Though the same could be said for just about any major Ubisoft game.\nOn the technical side, the game runs fine. Highest settings on a 1600x900 desktop with a few stutters and frame drops here and there, but nothing major. Graphics look great, as any AC game does.

It does its job just fine. It's a game. You play it. But it's so... boring! It's so aggravatingly bland and doesn't evolve the series from where it came from. It's just more of the same. Usually, that's fine in the case of a really good series like Half-Life and it's stellar gameplay being transferred to Opposing Force and Blue Shift, but Assassin's Creed III just stagnates. It goes in the same circle that Brotherhood and Revelation kept the formula from II spinning until it hit this just point of forgettable blandness.\nLet me elaborate. From a gameplay perspective, Assassin's Creed III isn't terrible. Far from it. In fact, it runs pretty well. The game never crashed on me. I never had any game-breaking bugs (There were some bugs, but it was forgiveable). The game looks great graphically too! But where I have my problems is in the upgrading, weapons, and side-objectives in this installment.\nNow, it's been a while since I've played Revelations, but I'm not as eager to go back to that installment because I know how much it took the weapons and side-objectives and made them just tacked-on unnecessary extras. I mean, certainly, Brotherhood started that trend with the crossbow and Assassin guild options but I still felt motivated to get those. Assassin's Creed III never gives you motivations to get new weapons. It never mentions in the story why you'd need anything besides your pistol, hidden blades, and tomahawk. The missions don't require you to upgrade any weapons or buy any new ones, and combat is easy enough with the basic weapons you already have.\nThe side-objectives also feel really half-a**ed in this game, too. They just pop up at random points in the game, like the treasure chests, viewpoints, and revolution objectives- but the game never gives you a reason to go out of your way and find them. You needed viewpoints in Brotherhood and II to find upgrades, and you wanted upgrades because it made Ezio a stronger character. I beat this game without grabbing anything extra for Connor, and that could either be a testament to me being a better gamer than I was five years ago or this game being p***-easy. I'm inclined to believe the latter.\nAlso, a massive annoyance is the full synchronization objectives in each missions. Brotherhood was fine because it gave the objectives to you at the beginning and didn't keep flashing them in front of your face every five seconds. It didn't feel like as much of an aggravation because your lack of synchronization was just more of a stubbed toe. But Assassin's Creed III counts our your synchronization points at the end of each level before you can look for the next objective, before you can even look at your map. It feels like your landlord counting out your meager rent payment and replying, \"350? I asked for 375. What is this horsesh**?\"\nBesides that, how is the story? Honestly, not that bad... from Connor's perspective. It handles the American Revolution maturely without glorifying the Americans and villifying the British. It's more of a story about the benefits and disadvantages of the ideals of both sides and how the Assassins and Templars agree and disagree with those ideas. Even George Washington, who's looked upon as a paragon in America, is shown as an honest human being with faults. I also thought the conclusion for Connor and his final target was handled well.\nHowever, it's a good 3-5 hours until you actually play as an Assassin, which can be a hump for some players. I'm not complaining about playing as Haytham, though. He was honestly my favorite character in the game. He's got loads more personality than Connor does. Connor is just slate-faced and p***ed-off about everything and that's either a fault of the voice actor or the writing. I'm inclined to believe it's a little of both. Connor doesn't even have an arc in this story. He's stubborn, impulsive, and stoic at the beginning of the game and ends the game the exact same way, albeit with some more respect for Achilles. A lot of the characters feel very flat. The only few standouts were Haytham Kenway, Thomas Hickey, and Achilles Davenport. Everyone else is pretty bland, which I think is both because of the stale voice delivery and stale writing.\nThere are some highlights in the game. I love the parts with Haytham, especially when Connor unexpectedly has to team up with him to find a target. And going through prison and nearly getting executed while trying to kill Thomas Hickey was very memorable. But a lot of characters act like the information they're talking about is already understood. A couple French generals are simply introduced without any explanation of who exactly they are and what they're doing in their scene. And there's a discussion on George Washington's leadership skills but there's so little time devoted to seeing him in action that I couldn't make heads or tails of who was correct in the debate because I had nothing to go off of.\nEven worse than Connor's story is that of Desmond's. I've never been a huge fan of Desmond, but the game feels so eager to fill you in on all the last details of his story before they *SPOILERS ON A GAME FIVE YEARS OLD* off him. And they off him really quickly with no repercussions on the other characters whatsoever. It's such an unsatisfying ending to an ultimately unsatisfying frame story.\nAssassin's Creed III is... okay. I know I've been ragging on it a lot, but I this game is part of the ASSASSIN'S Creed franchinse. The last few games had plenty of assassinating it, but the assassinating in this game feels so padded out and half-hearted because of all this bullsh** that's been thrown in around it. It's, in my opinion, one of the worst and most forgettable Assassin's Creed games, but that doesn't make it a bad game per se. It's a 5/10. Middle of the road.

I will fight, I will climb, I will jump from roof to roof! No. This part is about run ridiculously far, ride a horse and see the story videos.

The enemies are endless. So, the best fight was an accident.\n- Buildings are far from each other, so you can't run by roofs. One-two-three houses and you have to make leap of faith  into a cart of rotten cabbage. So, there is no point to even climb anywhere. It does not make your way shorter or give you any fun.\n- You have to run to the teleport point to activate it. Run a lot. And next time it still can be not available to jump to.

Jump to the end of it. 5. Turn back and walk to the edge/gate. 6. Hello NY, it was a fast travel!\n- Viewing points gives you nothing useful, so I just skipped it\n- Horses stuck at every stone and can't jump over basic obstacles. So it is not faster sometimes\n- You will learn to handle the ship. To use it twice. You will learn economics and trades and use it not even once. You will learn hunting and forget it as a bad dream. This is, actually, very good. Useless things are skippable. As well, as videos.\n- Nice try with ability to climb the mountains and trees. But I won the game and still not sure, where I can do it and where I can't.\n- One assassin walks into the bar... And he slowly walks through the hall, slowly goes to the second floor and get to the NPC's table. Every time. Because he can't run inside the buildings.\n- Incredible amount of re-runs and re-plays because of one idiotic wrong step. It is really annoying, when you can't do a simple, basic thing.\n- The story. It is probably good, but lack of gameplay ruins it anyway\nOf course, game can be played deeper and wider.

I love the cynical Haytham but much like his father, Connor is complex. He is one of the few character I had played at the time it came out that I could connect with on a WHOLE other level. I felt his pain and his dreams to better the world around him to save his village.\nI called Connor by his given name, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, all too often after playing my second time through.\nFor me, AC3 was something new from the original AC games. For me honestly felt less connection in Assassin's Creed 1, 2, brotherhood, and revelations. Even Unity. I felt some in Black Flag but that may be just because I loved the Kenway Saga in full.\nFor me there was just something of a gem in Assassin's Creed 3. Perhaps because I loved the early take on Colonial America and throw in the twist of Assassin vs Templar. The flair and new mechanics were fun, I loved teh feel of being a colonial. I loved exploring the wilderness and taking part in just getting lost wandering at some points or just going on a hunt for Redcoats. The enviorment was also at points dark, not so shiny and show off, and for many it was dull but I thought it was a nice closing to the story of Desmond and it was unique. One doesn't find that all so much in the following games per say. Plus for me, I loved Adrian Hough as the voice of Haytham and Noah Watts I actually enjoyed a lot as well.... there was a sense of purpose he brought to the character I felt, and even if he was perhaps the most colorful voice actor, I think he was perfect in capturing Connor as he truly is.\nFor me, and maybe even the few that loved it too, the open world and exploration one could do to cause chaos was... exciting. I didn't feel as though the slower points of the game were a drag. I didn't need the fast paced rush or the absolute colorful feelings of AC4 for AC3. This just wasn't a game I feel needed all that. Especially being it's the game that ends Desmond and allows for the future games to flourish. The story of a Native American who helps to try and create the imerging America is inspiring.

The vengeful Native American, Ratonhnhak\u00e9ton 'Connor' carves a bloody path to personal vindication, stopping off at the usual historical tourist spots that gives the franchise its flavour.\nVisuals:\nA photo-realistic depiction of North America's changing face really shines in AC3. The variety of environments does the game credit with changing seasons and day cycles adding atmosphere and character.\nAnimations have a few traditional Ubisoft bugs but there's a continued cinematic quality to scripted scenes. Still not a fan of AC's menus though.\nAudio:\nStunning soundtrack, a highlight in the series for sure composed by Lorne Balfour. The blend of sweeping orchestral pieces, blaring brass and the emigrant folk stylings perfectly capture the period and sustain action set pieces.\nBrilliant voice-acting shines with an impressive dedication to the rarely heard language of Connor's people.\nGameplay:\nA leap forward in the franchise's signature free-running sees Connor moving through urban environments with familiar ease AND the rugged landscape of the American wild that conjures a feeling of skill that truly suits a Native American master assassin.\nCamera controls as always plague the game however.\nCrafting and collecting helps lengthen the game but border on laborious at later stages.\nNaval combat makes a triumphant debut in the series that inspires further development.\nWriting:\nConnor lacks the depth or growth of his ancestor Ezio but channels wrath from scene to scene that starts as a blazing fire but soon gives way to a repetitive sizzle. His involvement in the bigger picture narrative feels sadly reluctant being a less than willing soldier in the great war between the shadowy factions.\nSupporting characters however display some great depth, namely Templar Grandmaster Haytham Kenway who continues to show that the Templars are far better written than the 'good guys'.\nThe appearance of significant historical figures feels contrived much if the time but kudos to writers Corey May and Matt Turner for not indulging too heavily in pandering to the unassailable image of George Washington by showing the darker side to the American 'hero'.\nI really enjoyed the effort Ubisoft Montreal put into AC3 and while a weak ending and a less defined protagonist hold the writing back but the level design, new mechanics and frenetic setting help liven things up.

I absolutely love how much detail has been put into the world, and the Multiplayer is fun as well. The parkour is usually fun, but has its kinks. The same goes for the combat. I have experienced few glitches, but the glitches I have experienced almost make the game unplayable. There are also some mini-games that are REQUIRED for some missions, but they are very hard to control using a keyboard. I've seen some people complain that the world is too big, and that you spend too much time just running around. This is almost a pro for me, because it gives me more time to play the game, and it makes the collectible challenges feel more challenging, especially when you can just buy a map that shows you where is everything (which was very helpful).\nPros:\n+Parkour is fun FOR THE MOST PART. There are a few glitches I will discuss later. It's really fun to run across rooftops or treetops, and I really love how realistic it feels. I don't feel like I'm some sort of superhuman, just a really cool dude.\n+Combat is fun FOR THE MOST PART. There are a few glitches I will discuss later. It's fun to be able to take on a bunch of baddies at once like a badass, and I love how the more people you kill in the open world, the more dangerous the enemies become (until you die or go incognito). I also love how different enemies must be taken down in different ways.\n+Multiplayer is fun FOR THE MOST PART. There are a few glitches I will discuss later (see a patern?). Multiplayer really does seem to require some skill, and is far from the button mashing combat system in single player. I actually have to try to strategize, and had to learn to detect subtle movements made by players that would indicate whether they are trying to kill me. The multiplayer is one of the main reasons I bought the game. I just wanted to get on and kill some of my friends.\n+The different outfits I have unlocked are really cool. Not only can you unlock different outfits entirely, but you can buy new color configurations for your original Assassin's uniform. While there are some DLC outfite (which I got with the Deluxe Edition), most of the outfits are unlockable in the game, and are sort of like acheivements. I am so happy that the game went this route, instead of making all the outfits DLC.\nCons:\n-Sometimes it is hard to direct where you are going to jump while parkouring. Sometimes I seem to jump in a direction that I never meant to, or I somehow jump off a ledge and die when I don't mean to. Sometimes I can't climb at all unless I run away and then run back to the wall. This becomes very annoying when I am trying to be stealthy.\n-Combat is okay. It tends to get pretty repetative, and it also glitches. I seem to often encounter situations where I obviously parry an attack, but for some reason it doesn't work. I've also had situations where I become stuck in the slow-mo mode that turns on when you kill people. This has happened a couple times, so it isn't really a biggy.\n-Multiplayer bugs sometimes.\n-There are other random bugs I will experience\n-The story is a little boring and lazy. Sometimes things conveniently line up, or characters make diecisions that don't make sense. Other times relationships or dialogue seems forced. This is more apparent in the side missions where you are taking care of your homestead. Sometimes the story can get very boring, and missions will often become \"go talk to this person,\" and then \"go talk to this person\" for hours on end.\n- There are several minigames spread throughout the game. Some are well integrated, while others are hard to control and clunky. Often times no instructions are given, and you are left on your own to figure out how the game works.

There's alot of running around, and the action isn't super fast paced. While this would make it seem stealth focused, the stealth mechanics are mediocre.

Still, if you've got nothing better to do then you can still enjoy it, it is just that I cannot justify the amount of time it is taking to play the game when there are better games out there to spend my time on.

There's essentially two games here, a by the numbers focus group-made AAA game that spreads itself too thin and a game that actually tells an interesting story beyond the obvious.

But I was captivated by the presentation of a person of color in a leading role, especially as its set in Colonial America. Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton (aka \"Connor\") was criticized for being dull and unlikeable, but how else would you expect someone in that position to take the role and still seem genuine? Connor has been discriminated, persecuted, and alienated throughout his life, and so responds by being serious and dutiful. He has to prove himself adequate at every turn just for his existance to be acknowledged, while at the same time trying to hold unto his principles and idealism.

It features a new engine (AnvilNext) as well as a complete new set of animations and new assets. It is therefore a fresh new start in the series, with a new protagonist and yet still delivering the same narrative style and continuin the story of the previous games.\nThe AnvilNext engine was promoted for its ability to display enormous crowds, making the game's open world and cities feel much more alive. Additionally, it allows the game to display a great number of soldiers making historic battles (Battle of Bunker Hill, etc) much more believable. At least, that's what was stated during the promotional campaign.\nThe truth is that the developers have delivered on their promise when it comes to displaying civilians around the cities of Boston or New York, however, the main instance where you are actually seeing a legitimate battle taking place, at the Battle of Bunker Hill, is a joke.\nYes, there are quite a bit of NPCs rendered, however, they feel very static and the interaction is very limited, they are displayed on the background and you do not get to have a significant part in the action.\nNext up, we have the infamous combat system of the AC games. If you are looking for a skill based combat which will challenge you throughout your experience, this is not it. It is based upon button mashing and counter kills. I don't think it is that much of a turnoff, but for some people it might be very boring and repetitive if not distracting.\nI do not think AC3 is a bad game, there obviously was quite a bite of effort and love put into it, however I have a couple of main problems with it.\n1 - The Tutorial\nI have never seen a longer tutorial in a game before. It literally takes about 5-7 hours to compelete the entire sequences of the game which are designed to form the protagonist into the skilled Assassin he is meant to become. However, you might think that this might be dentrimental to his development as a character. Worry not, most of these sequences are simply narrated cutscenes in which you have no possible control over. Plainly said, the game is way too slow in its beginning.\n2 - The Story\nThe story of this game is just not believable. Part of me thinks the game as a whole and especially towards the end was extremely rushed. The dialogues are bland and way too random. I cannot count the amount of Ex Machinas in this game in order to drive the narrative forward, such as random characters giving an answer to a plot point. The protagonist is annoying, and the main redeeming factor of the story is that the modern day elements of this particular AC games are actually very well executed and quite enjoyable.\nAll in all, AC3 is not a bad game and for its current price it deserves a try and you might find it quite fun.

It's not my favorite in the series, and it definitely struggles in a few areas, but it is still a really great game in my opinion. I'm just going to talk about some of the features, sorry if I come off as rambling.\nThe environment in this game is fantastic. The places you can visit in this game are really amazing. I love exploring the frontier, especially. It was nice and varied and the treetop parkour was really fun. The cities, however, are not my favorite cities in Assassin's Creed, feeling a bit too sparse with buildings. I like being able to traverse all across a city on the rooftops, which I was unable to really do in this game, oftentimes having to jump down to the ground to continue.\n+Story: Now here is where I understand a lot of people feel the game is lacking. I think Connor is a great character, in that he feels like a real person who has his own feelings and doubts and motivations. I'm not saying that everything he did in this game is 100% the right thing to do, but that everything he did was understandable from his viewpoint. I also like how this game shows a bit more of the Templars' side of the war\nThis game shows more gray areas than the Ezio trilogy did, and paints the conflict as less of a \"good vs. evil\" thing.\nA few other thoughts:\nThere's a lot of stuff to do in this game, like hunting and trapping, and buying and selling goods, and crafting, and going on naval missions, along with the standard Ubisoft collectibles. A lot of it, however, feels tacked-on and not very important. I played through the whole game without ever once crafting something. The hunting is fun, although there's still not much point to it unless you want 100% sync.\nThe stealth and AI detection in this game is infuriating in a way it hasn't been in any previous titles or in any game that came after this one. Guards will turn around and attack you for no freaking reason and without provokation. Also good luck dealing with guards on the rooftops without getting the whole city on your tail.\nThe combat is alright, it feels nice and you feel very powerful after eliminating ten soldiers in as many seconds, but it's way too easy and the various weapons you can equip make no difference at all in combat. I just used Connor's default tomahawk for the whole game because it was Aesthetic.\nThe \"Assassin\" recruits in the game (and I say Assassin in quotation marks because are they? Are they Assassins? Or are they just some people that decide to help Connor out? I have no clue) are completely laughable, and useless for anything other than helping out in overwhelming combat scenarios. They have a lot of functions, like sniping or escorting for stealth, but you can just as easily forget they exist because most any of the scenarios in the game can easily be accomplished solo. A significant downgrade from the Assassins in Brotherood and Revelations, which were always right there to efficiently take out anyone you pointed at.\nI think that's about it.

If you played the Ezio Trilogy, you know how endearing the characters and overall story became to you. You loved it. Now, imagine playing something that looks a little bit like one of those games, but where you play as a bratty, unsympathetic main character who constantly makes poor decisions and lets the bad guys get away. EVERY TIME. He is literally always complaning and angsty. Now sure, when he's a young man, that may be acceptable and one could brush it off as him just needing some time to be impetuous and foolish and learn from his mistakes. This is what I did. I hoped he would grow up. I hoped the story of this game would get better. I was sure eventually it wouldn't end up being a colossal waste of my time. NOPE. I was wrong. So very, very wrong.

DESYNCHRONIZED.\")\nThe \"open world\" is near-endless, mindless and pointless busy-bodying for scant if any rewards, whereas the main story is basically on rails (almost as on-rails as Max Payne 3).\nTake what you love about Assassin's Creed and...pretty much either throw it out the window or amp it up to where it's too much.\nYou can hardly ever upgrade your character (in any functional, non-cosmetic way) or even buy much in the way of improved weapons (and no armor anywhere), stealth is largely impossible because of so many guards, but you can usually brute-force the combat anyway.  And not that I'm a fan of crafting, but you can't craft until nearly the end of the game (or ...geez I hope I'm near the end of the game, in Sequence 9) and what you can make is pretty much only useful for getting more money...so ironically it's worthless at that point.   (And you're telling me a Native American needs some white dude, and a \"Level 3\" white dude at that, just to make *arrows*?)\nWhile cutscenes in AC2 were great for moving the story and introducing characters, in AC3 you'll start skipping them because a) you don't care** and b) you just want control of your $%^# character back!  Alternatively, you can maximize your efficiency by scheduling your many Google-checks of \"How do I _____?\" during the cutscenes.\nThat's right, it is often *very* unclear how to do what you want (e.g., to send assassins on missions, you hold down T and then click the mouse but don't just click anywhere near \"Contracts\", you have to click right on the mouse icon!).\nMuch of what went wrong in AC3, they fixed in AC4:Black Flag.\nSo, if you don't mind gaps in your anti-Abstergo narrative, skip from AC2 to 4.  (Brotherhood was still pretty good, Revelations not so much.)\n*For those who will point out \"these are optional requirments\"-- yeah, a giant red X that shows up repeatedly throughout the mission, and that robs you from getting any reward, is \"optional\"?\n**Re. \"don't care\": One reviewer complained of the love story between Norris and hunter-lady that you basically have to do everything for him \"short of guiding his\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665into her \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\"", "hours": 39.7, "user_id": "76561198030325468", "username": "HawlEffect", "products": 109, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

He is an unintelligent meathead who blunders along and is always reacting to problems rather than planning ahead and being proactive. It was very frustrating to play as such a tool of a character is who derided by other characters in game for his poor decision-making skills.\nPart of the reason for my dislike is I compare him to Haytham, the character you control at the outset of the game, and while Haytham is competent, charismatic, and practical, Connor is none of those things. The entire Templar vs Assassin ideology finds fertile storytelling in this game but the Templars (the erstwhile villains) come across as very rational and pragmatic while the Assassins seem more like kids stamping their feet and saying \"Stop liking things I don't like!\"\nThe historical databse in-game was very fun to read, however, as you see the people and events of the American Revolution as viewed through the eyes of an Englishman. Enlightening and an educational read, as were the databases in previous games, so the game shines in this regard.\nThis is not a bad game, but it is a bad Assassin's Creed game. Good to play and see the modern day story unfold with Desmond and company but otherwise a bit off-putting. Combat is good, parkour is good, interesting crafting system (though I used little of it since I hate crafting but I can see the appeal), level design is beautiful, and the sound of your tomahawk smashing skulls never gets old.

Not only did I enjoy the game tremendously story wise, not only I liked the ending (I've heard it sucks!), not only I didn't mind Connor being how he was (though yeah, he feels like unfinished business. He sounds lifeless,  but it's sort of understandable providing what past he came from. Yeah he could be more polished a protagonist, I'll give nay-sayers that).\nHave to admit though this game has been (for me) completely taken by Templars. Because Haytham is magnificent \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\nTo sum it up:\nCons:\n- A lot of odd hatred toward the game. Connor not being Ezio is not a catastrophe, you know.\n- Some things are basically useless, like stealing. You don't really need it for anything unlike in, say, AC I when it was useful for replenishing your stack of throwing knives.\n- Again, all the pistols, swords and other weapons are just collectibles and visuals.\n- Outfits, few are goods, most are ugly. Also, you have only few dyes to choose from, and if you put something other then default outfit, odd things happen with Connor's haircut in cutsceenes.\n- Some 100% synch requirements are maddening.\n- Lifeless Indian speech. Why there was no emotion in actors' voices is beyond me.\n- Not many silly/creepy bugs AC I and AC II contained. I sort of remember them fondly.\n- All right, Connor makes little sense sometimes and acts as if he didn't know what he wanted. Though, maybe he doesn't.\nPros:\n- Awesome settings in awesome times. Alternative versions of historical events - me likey!\n- Combat: I liked it always, I like it here, too. More brutal.\n- Pretty ok-ish story. If devs haven't decided otherwise, it would create a good start for some AC in the future, taking off from where AC III ended.\n- Ending speaking truth about human nature. (No wonder so many dislike it!)\n- Characters. There are many interesting characters, even if main protagonist is not one of them.\n- Music. It's epic.\n- Places you visit are very authentic, climatic and alive.\n- Explaining other side of the never ending conflict. I like it when it's not black and white, and like it or not, Templars make a lot of sense.\n- NAVAL MISSIONS! Pure joy. Even if one of the hardest 100% syncs was one of them.\n- You can hunt.

You get to hunt wildlife and craft things such as bags to store items and such with the animal skins, you get to shoot a bow, you set traps and snare to catch wildlife, and yes, other games give you that, but they made a good mix in this one. You explore the land during the homesteading of some parts of the US, get a highly cleaned up glimpse of what life used to be back then and what things were important to early settlers. You get to experience a lof of wildlife interaction, ride horses (whistle for horses and they magically appear - I like that). You can fast travel but you'll find yourself taking the horse most of the time. If you see wolves, find the nearest tree and climb it, seriously, the fight mechanics when you get attacked by a wolf are horrible, they are similar to how they did it in one of the Prince of Persia games (thanks Ubisoft) where you have to time your attack to the flashing on the screen, well, they took that crap and added different buttons / keys that you have to press at different moments to push away a wolf that has attacked you. Seriously, go up a tree, take it/them (usually in pack 10/10 for realism) out with your bow.\nYou get to sail a large-ish ship (sort of a preview to Black Flag), which is nice. There are many references to historical events, depicted with you in the middle of them (spoiler alert) for example you walk up to a group of soldiers and hear the \"don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes\" speach being given.

I have nearly 1200 games in my library and recently went on vacation to an offline location where I was unpleasantly surprised with the mandatory online requirements of a few games that had no reason or labeling other than a one time key activation.\nThis is not A debate post I will not go back and forth on the quality of the game as the quality is meaningless if the game fails to function under its own requirements, or the fairness of this issue. It is clearly unfair as it is not presented to the buyer and if it was it would still be unfair as much as a car not being able to crank without being connected to its manufacturer. Trust me it's a selling point on an outdated broken concept. DRM of any kind is a virus, those that cripple a purchased product is theft.\nOK rant out of the way!\nThis Is about the simplicity of the FACT GTAV does not work offline  indefinitely yet GTA IV does. Or that DOOM as an ID/ bethesda product does not function offline indefinitely, but their other products like wolfenstien does. MGSV:TPP does not while MGS:GZ and revengeance does, and finally FFVII does not yet FFIX and the others do.\nAgain this is NOT A DEBATE about the semantics of it all, but a FACT of information that needs to be given to any potential buyer of these products. YOU WILL HAVE TO ALWAYS HAVE A CONNECTION. They will function offline for a period of time. As with any software that is purchased I think the FTC should force not only the type OF DRM like Denuvo to be labeled but the function of said DRM and what information it collects, requirements and the system resources it uses.\nFair trade laws do in fact apply to the video game world, especially for proper labeling of products, and functionality, as well as fair contractual agreements are still a legal obligation.", "hours": 24.8, "username": "kingarthurivvi", "products": 1283, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I think the best game in the series that I review will try to tell you why. Let's start with the plot. The story I liked very much, it has everything for this game, great plot twists. Holes in the plot I was watching. Graphics/great Gameplay for games of that year, however, in one of the missions was a bug with the hair of Connor. The game also written a great soundtrack. The ending of the game is great, however, killed the main character of the series, that broke the series in my opinion. Overall the game is excellent and I advise everyone to play it. Besides the main missions, the game is available for many additional missions. Search for treasure, travel in the sea, to improve his estate, to liberate the city and to recruit new assassins. However, these missions are not so easy, but for them, you will get a good reward and enhance synchronization. This game changed the parkour, it was much better.

Really, you play as Connor, who takes part in the Ameican Revolution because the plot says so, and because it makes for intesting mission setpieces.\nAs Connor, you supposedly sneak around, parkouring through trees and over buildings and sneaking around or murdering guards en route to various assassination targets.\nOf course, in actuality, judging by gameplay time, Assassin's Creed III is a game about running around in the woods gathering feathers and crafting items whih have no actual value whatsoever.\nAssasssin's Creed III is quite large - there are two fairly large cities, plus a Frontier area which is several virtual miles across, and a homestead area which is fairly large as well.\nAnd yet, these environments leave me wondering why they're even there. They're EMPTY. Most of the frontier is just trees, rocks, and hills, with very little of interest there; there are animals wandering around, but that's a bad joke; the animals themselves are just a tedious distraction. There are a smattering of collectables scattered around, but they still often aren't within  hundred yards of each other, and almost all of them feel like they were just stuck into the environment to extend playtime - indeed, the almanacs never result in you talking to Benjamin Franklin again to turn them in, while the feather collection sidequest is completely arbitrary and has ZERO actual payoff in-game - you arbitrarily unlock an outfit and that's it.\nThere are fixed sidequests which feel like they might as well have been procedurally generated for all the \"story\" involved in them. There is hunting of animals, and trading of skins via caravans - which is an extremely tedious process with a terrible UI which bears no real purpose beyond generating vast amounts of money you don't need. There's a \"crafting\" system which is driven entirely by completing sidequests with the NPCs in your homestead, and which could have just had the NPCs grant you the results after you completed the quests, without the tedious system involved.\nJoining you on your feather collection duties are six assassins. Unlike in previous entries in the AC series, your assassin recruits actually have individual personalities, and you can chat with them a bit and get to know them a little. This is a huge step up. Too bad that, unlike in the previous games, you don't get a capstone quest from any of them, so after you recruit them, they might as well not exist as things you interact with.\nOh, and you can't use them at all in the huge wilderness area for no apparent reason.\nYou can level them up via a menu-based sidequest system which simply serves to divert more of your time away from actually being an assassin. It probably has some effect, but I could never really tell, and while they were useful, they were often unavailable when they\u2019d be most useful.\nThere\u2019s just so much garbage in this game, and the game pretends like it is important, but ultimately, it is just there to make the game much longer than it should be \u2013 vastly so. I\u2019d say you probably spend maybe 20% of your play time on the actual main storyline.\nThe main storyline is a mess plot-wise; you keep skipping between various major historical events, but the protagonist, Connor, is a one-dimensional anger-driven character on a quest for revenge. Except that by the end of it, you, the player, are left wondering why Connor even cares anymore, as it isn\u2019t even clear if your primary target is even responsible for the thing you are ostensibly angry about. The various historical figures flit in and out of the narrative, never sticking around for long enough to care about them. The only character you can really care about is the first mate of your ship and Haytham, the first protagonist in the game who later on becomes an anti-villain, and who may be more of a hero than the actual protagonist is.\nThe game is meant to try and highlight some moral ambiguity, but it is undermined when the protagonist, who often seems to act as a mouthpiece for how morally ambiguous it all is, does exactly the things he \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665es about other people doing and doesn\u2019t even seem to acknowledge that fact - nor does the game.\nThe actual historical figures generally get short shrift as well \u2013 George Washington and Samuel Adams only show up for a few sequences each, and it is hard to feel like Connor is connected to either of them in any real sense, which means that when he gets angry at them, it is hard for the player to care, either.\nThe only really good thing about this game are the actual setpieces. Once you get out of the ridiculously long tutorial and into the meat of the game, the setpiece battles are actually fairly neat and varied. Your tasks in these battles are reasonably interesting, and your work in helping the Patriots win the revolution is varied enough to keep interesting. While some of the alternative 100% completion objectives are more than a little wonky,\nThe game also has about 20 or so ship missions where you pilot a large sailing ship through various battles. These are reasonably fun, and vary between short, punchy missions and longer battles which are a bit more intense. These are not terribly hard, but they are mostly pretty enjoyable, and serve to break up the run-around-and-stab-people gameplay further.\nUnfortunately, almost all of your time with the game is likely to be consumed doing things other than these things, and the game seems to encourage you to do so. And alas, the plot itself is a mess, so you pretty much have to appreciate things for the moment, rather than how they fit into Connor\u2019s story.\nThere is an overarching modern-day story as well which (at least ostensibly) completes the arc for Desmond from the previous games. Alas, the cool conspiracy theory stuff from AC2 is gone; it is really just two generic sides fighting against each other, and you only play three missions in the present, and while they\u2019re okay, they\u2019re nothing really special. Some of the modern-day sequences are the best in the game, and at least the modern day story mostly makes sense and has characters with decent voice actors who actually seem to have personalities, but in the end there isn\u2019t enough focus there for it to really carry the game.\nOne final note: the game itself is surprisingly buggy. I fell through the ground at least a few times, enemies sometimes spawned inside objects, some of the alternate mission objectives felt luck-based, and sometimes your secondary pistol would disappear randomly and not be able to be used until you visited a general store and swapped weapons.\nAll in all, I can\u2019t recommend Assassin\u2019s Creed III. It is mostly tedious \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t.", "hours": 82.1, "username": "TheTitaniumDragon", "products": 1160, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

First of all, the fact that you have to use Uplay almost makes me want to not recommend the game on Steam. More often than not you'll find that the cloud servers are down and maybe even your 98% save that you were itching to complete has been deleted (happened to me). Extremely annoying.\nSecond, the game is poorly optimized for PC. FPS drops are frequent, especially in populated city areas, even with a fairly high-end PC and lowering your graphics settings barely has any effect. The controls are okayish, but especially free-aiming is clunky at best. The game also has a tendency to crash randomly but it's fortunately not common.\nThird, the game is still quite buggy. Enemies stuck inside walls or other unreachable areas, animals freezing in quicktime-events, you name it. While some of them are pretty hilarious and don't break the game, some may require you to restart your game.\nBut that's enough about the bad, let's talk about the good stuff. The game is visually impressive, has an interesting storyline, has good open world-elements and fun combat. Especially the homestead and naval missions were an excellent touch, though I still feel that you aren't rewarded enough for exploring (who wants to run around collecting pages?). The story is quite strong and much more morally dubious than AC I and II. The game really makes you wonder at times whether you are fighting for the right side, and although Connor could've been better developed as a character, he is still badass :)\nTo sum it all up, I definitely recommend this game, but only if you are willing to put up with some Ubisoft BS.", "hours": 213.0, "user_id": "76561198093201625", "username": "-villejh-", "products": 76, "early_access": false}

You CAN play AC III without having played any other AC games, I seemed to enjoy the game and the story without having played any other AC games; the story is broken off into two main parts, the 'real world' and inside the animus (where you play the game (1775's America)), I would say that the 'real world' part of the game only takes place for 10% of the game and you play 90% of the game within the animus. The story within the animus is GREAT, there are so many plot twists and things you don't see coming whilst still managing to keep a serious tone; some parts have comedy and other parts have drama, it is so polar yet it manages to keep you hooked.\nUnfortunately the game really falls apart when you have to play the 'real world' parts of the game (modern day, not 1775's America), the story completely shifts as if they changed the writers and takes a completely boring/emotionless turn; it reverts back to the 'boring\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665assassin's creed formula' and just makes you want to stop playing :(. The story within the animus DOES have closure but don't expect to understand anything in the real world portion of the game.\nOnto the gameplay.\nThe only other problem I had with this game is performance, this game is a console port and is clearly meant to be played on Nvidia graphics cards. Don't expect to get over 45fps if you are playing on an AMD card. I had no problem with saving my game progress and I could return to the point where I left off. I didn't encounter any glitches but there are some parts where the game design is hard to follow (e.g. getting lost when following someone or not knowing where/how to climb a building).\n(Also you can sail on naval ships on side quests and re-do missions, so no need to get AC4 either)\nOverall, AC III is a pretty decent game, it will endure you in with '90%' of it's story and will satisfy you with the gameplay, I'd give it an 8/10.", "hours": 28.8, "username": "Sam", "products": 134, "early_access": false}

The reason for this is that they packed so many pointless fetch quests, side-missions and collectibles that it often feels like a chore and not fun as it should be. But the naval missions are fantastic. Sailing your own ship is the best part of the game and there is no wonder AC4 is all about that. The visuals really shine in this part and I had loads of fun. Normal combat is okay and combos cool but mostly you will want to avoid huge/long fights. The Connor story has ups and downs but ends up a bit unresolved as to what happens to Connor. Not that you will care for him because Connor becomes more and more unlikable as the game progresses. Homestead missions are an exception. While not very challenging they show Connor in some good light as he builds a community of people. While I like that we get a character who is unsure of what to do Connor's motivations are all over the place. So much that at one point I just rooted for the templars which is a first time in an AC game. The pacing of Desmond parts is pretty bad. Just when Connor starts to be fun you are taken out of the Animus to do missions with Desmond. They should just have the intro part, afterwards you play as Connor and the end of the game would be just the Desmond finale. But instead the weird pacing coupled with a terrible ending makes me sad about how they finished the Desmond story. Multiplayer is nice but I only really enjoyed the team stuff because PvP stopped being fun really fast. I am gonna barely go with Recommended because there are just enough good parts to balance out the bland and bad stuff. If you want some DLC for this game get the Season Pass (if you have AC3 already) but it is best to get the Deluxe Edition which contains AC3+Season Pass+Benedict Arnold DLC. A must for owners of the previous games but even then it is best to go with the Deluxe version on sale. I bought the Deluxe Edition on sale at -75% so I can say I surely got my money's worth. For anyone else - there are better AC games you can buy.\nTo activate the Season Pass and Benedict Arnold DLC (Deluxe Edition only), take each of the DLC CD-keys Steam shows you, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code, restart the game and you should see DLC info pop up (if it does not work try to redeem the codes in uPlay too).\nThe Life Scratcher Pack (upgrades+items), Ezio's Outfit (skin), The Renegade Pack for multiplayer (character+items).\n------------------------------------------------------------------", "hours": 112.1, "username": "Artibius", "products": 491, "early_access": false}

I got this DLC when I bought the Deluxe edition on a sale, but I definitely recommend buying this DLC for those who have the standard AC3 game! The only two things that bothered me in this DLC were:\n1) there are chests and treasures literally everywhere! At first, I collected them all - which took quite a while - but then I actually noticed that they are not useful at all. They offer upgrades to the quiver and pistol and give you ammo, but I did not use those very often in the game;\n2) the 'save citizens' / 'attack convoys' etc. challenges were very easy to farm and redo in order to get a 100% sync, but they kept popping up if you had already succesfully executed enough of them.

It can get frustrating at times, and did lead to a few mission failures when having to keep up with a target through winding back alleys.\nSo much potential for a great game in here, but it just didn't hook me at all.

Ezio is a bon vivant, Edward is a salty rascal, and Connor is a stoic Native American.  His character isn't as \"fun,\" but he is spot-on when I compare him to other Native Americans in my personal experience.\nThe gameplay is (by now) vintage AC, and it is somewhat less sophisticated than Black Flag.  The sailing missions are also much more limited than BF or Rogue, which is appropriate given its placement in the series.  But where the game shines is in the story, with actual characters and development that makes sense for a change.  The modern scenes are a bit off-putting, but stil fit into the narrative.  If you know the history of the time, many of the characters become more interesting and it creates greater immersion in the story.  Think of Ezio as a swashbuckler movie, Edward as (obviously) a more serious pirate romp, and Connor as a fine period drama.  If that is your thing, this is a great title, and one of the best.  If you are looking for a well-crafted story, this is also a good choice.  If you know nothing of US history or don't care for a more realistic depiction of Native Americans than we usually get in games, then keep on walking.\nUpdate: Hundreds of hours of AC gameplay later, I still like this one for its story.

So I came back and I tried to like this game, I tried REALLY hard to like this game, and in the end I think I kinda did. Somewhat. At its core, this game is a pretty weak entry in the AC franchise, and a rather poor conclusion to the Desmond story. Connor's story is enjoyable, but not as enjoyable as Ezio's. The side content is okay, but doesn't hold a candle to Black Flag's. Ultimately, this game is pretty average, but still low on the list of AC games.\nHere's why: The only fun parts of the game are hidden beneath HEAPS of boring, tedious, repetitive nonsense. Some could argue that the same could be said about any AC game, or even any Ubisoft game for that matter, but it is absolutely the most apparent in AC3. I didn't really start having fun until I had reached about 60% synchronization (which you will not reach unless you dedicate time to side content), yet most of that fun was limited anyway. In the end, I can't really say that it was worth shoveling through dirt, snow, and\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to find that fun.\nMany times while playing this game I found myself downright infuriated by stupid controls (or lack thereof) and extremely annoying optional objectives and side missions. I don't mind a challenge, but far too many times I had to restart memories due to completely ridiculous constraints for full synchronization. That is NOT FUN.\nAnother thing that really culled my enjoyment of the game was the glitches. There are far too many glitches in this game. I don't quite remember that many my first time through a few years ago, but now that I've spent significantly more time playing I have experienced a ridiculous amount of glitches. While some glitches can be quite hilarious, like the Aquila doing flips in the water, many ended up having me fall through the map or have me chase someone who ends up stuck in a wall, preventing me from being able to tackle them.\nAlong with those glitches comes the crashes. While I don't have some top of the line computer with the upper crust capabilities of 2016, I certainly have a strong enough computer to handle this 2012 game at its highest settings. Yet despite that, I experienced at least 10 crashes throughout the game, the final crash resulting in my save file desynching from the cloud save, and the game being unable to even recover it. So I didn't even get to achieve 100% sync, and this occured when I was at the final memory, around 95% sync. It's hard to effectively portray how infuriating that is.\nWhat I have to admit is that they really tried to innovate Assassin's Creed with this game. Unfortunately, it really fell flat. A lot of the new innovations carried over to Black Flag, where they were much more polished and refined. Is it fair to praise Black Flag when AC3 did it first? I would say yes, because Black Flag just does everything so much better. Better ship combat, better optional objectives, better guns, better hunting, better tools, better everything.\nIn the end, this game certainly isn't terrible, and does make some good innovations over the previous titles, but the very next game handled everything so much better and just completely eclipsed this. The only reason I can really give to play this game at all is to see the conclusion of Desmond's story from AC1 to AC3.

Connor doesn't listen to what you want him to do half the time, will run up walls for no reason, will run up walls when there's no wall there, fail to assassinate when you click, fail to jump when you press right click and space, will rubber-band back onto railings that's he's on, et cetera, and in missions where you can't be detected this is fatal, and since during the missions this franchise is never forgiving when it comes to checkpoints during stealth, this creates a huge waste of time. Facial animation is often inaccurate or out of sync with the audio, and the subtitles are full of errors and sometimes just plain wrong. The shooting mechanic is nearly useless if you're actually trying to use F to aim unless your target is COMPLETELY stationary, and even then it may or may not work depending on the camera. Hunting is boring and tedious. You have to go out of your way to get money so you save time by just never buying anything. Did I mention the controls are terrible? NPCs frequently just disappear for no reason. There's a mission where you have to loot a corpse to get a uniform, but if redcoats attack you too much, then once you've killed enough the corpse disappears and you have to restart the missions. Graphical pop-in and LOD is horrid even at the highest settings. In present day, Rebecca now looks like an anime girl I guess and has no facial expressions. Ever. She always has that same blushy almost smile. ALWAYS. She, Desmond and William frequently have their idle animations messed up while they're talking to you. Shaun's head goes inside his body, Rebecca owl-necks, which are kind of funny, but it's annoying when you're walking together and they keep stuttering. Not enough Desmond playtime. The Desmond sequences are fantastic but take 5 minutes, maybe 8 if you're slow, to complete, and there's only 3 or so. Overall a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665game that could've been decent, even quite good, if actually PLAYING it was any fun.", "hours": 28.3, "user_id": "76561198024094517", "username": "Giant Turtle", "products": 168, "early_access": false}

But this is probably the worst in the series.\nThis is the second time around I try to get through this game, and it's every bit as tedious as it was the first time around.\nIt was superb when Brotherhood and Revelations introduced allies you could use in combat, but here they're all morons apparently. Get the first ally, the chef-guy ? He has no experience, so gets incapacitated in combat before he manages to be useful. Send him on mission, through clunky, uninformative \"Assassin Guild\" interface ? 80% chance, fails. No experience. Get additional allies for mission to increase success ? How ? No idea, the game doesn't mention it.\nThere's only some semi-indicative things on the map in the cities. Ok, try to clear some of those \"Liberation\" missions - just spent 20 minutes killing people, hoping to acquire another assassin recruit - only to get gold on completion. Hm. Do some other assassin-symbol mission stuff - get to be escorted by two allies in disguise - have to walk on-board a ship, they drop in the water and die. Stealth goes out the window. Could still just walk through the guards, in the restricted area-zone, and kill the target in front of twenty enemies. Huh. And the escort-thing is apparently some ability you can use assassin recruits for.. IF YOU HAD ANY.\nAnyway, completed, get the assassin recruit guy, yay! But.. But why can't I use them now ? Oh, \"can't access recruits outside the city\"... But I am literally standing in the city, in the zone where I met him. HE WAS JUST, HERE. Until of course he drowned, randomly. Hmm.. Maybe there's a timer-like thingy indicating when he'll be available again ? Nope. Okay.. Assasssin Guild interface... Nope, him AND chef-guy, unavailable. Okay. One more gripe, why does the guild interface show the missions already completed ? They can't be done again, so they're just time-wasting selections you have to go through, whenever you want to start a new mission (if it ever becomes accessible again, who knows).\nSome people might find the earlier games to be easier, and I agree. But they were also more approachable, I find, compared to this. I want to love this game as much as the rest, but every step of the way it's tiringly cumbersome.\nThe giant sandboxy world is given credit by some, but I just find I spend way more time running and trying to get to the missions or places I need to be, whereas the other games in the series, it felt more like just-on-the-edge-of-too-long travel time, but still enjoyable. Also the traversing the world part of it was.. \"nimble\", whereas in this one, half the times the controls are getting in the way. Want to run through some fancy getaway spot ? Nope, lean up against the wall, all stealthy-like whilst ten enemies are readying to fire at you. Oh you wanted to run PAST the barrel/shopstand ? No, dive onto it, owling, just to pass more time! Yey!\nAnd the combat.. At one point, I was running, without any notoriety/wanted-level nonsense. Apparently that was enough, because as I ran past some guards, they decided to engage and pursue. No reason why. Must be hell being a courier. Okay, run for some ten minutes, can't get away. Fine, we'll just fight. And fight. And fight. Half the time, the status-indicator above the head just vanishes. Manage to kill ten enemies, more just come running. And more. And more. Decide to run again and finally get out of sight, enter one of those printer-shops to remove the wanted level, tedious cutscene entering the building... CAN'T TALK TO THE PRINTER GUY. He's just standing around.\nThere's also some homestead-stuff where you can gather people and they craft stuff and you can.. trade it for money, or something. Okay.. Craft a wagon.. Instead of buying one, for some reason. Spend some time with the finicky-interface to get a convoy going.. It says it'll make 40 money on completion. If it's succesful, because it can be attacked and lost. 40. Killing 2-3 guards makes that same amount. INSTANTLY. PICKPOCKETING CIVILIANS, DOES THE SAME. What in the name of George Crushington was the purpose of the convoys ? Might come later in the game, though everything seems to be a let-down, time and time again, as I get further into the game.\nThere's also some customization available. You can purchase a few different-colored variations of the Assassin outfit worn. But it'll be the standard tomahawky-white one in cutscenes.. Feels like that wouldn't be too hard to manage, that the colour in the cutscenes stay the same as the worn ones, since it's in-game. Oh well. There's also weapons to purchase, though.. I've no idea why you'd do that, since their statistics, although displayed in the shop interface, don't really seem to do... anything in combat. Same moves, same speed.. What, is, the, point. Just don't get it. Another area the game doesn't present any information on.\nAnd it's a shame, so much potential gone to waste. Of course there's plenty of the now-standard Ubisoft game bugs as well.\nWould recommend Rogue, Revelations, Black Flag or Brotherhood instead, in that order, by a gazillion nautical miles.", "hours": 16.0, "user_id": "76561197991229443", "username": "Antaeus", "products": 237, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 93, "page_order": 2, "recommended": false, "date": "2016-08-07", "text": "The PC version of this game is awful. I've never posted a review before, but would like to spare any others the pain of this game.\nI should start by saying I really enjoyed AC1, AC2, Brotherhood and Revelations. Unless you are hooked on the story of the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, and *really* want to go through the story for yourself, however, avoid this awful game. This game is *nothing* like the first four episodes in terms of play style, story style, controls, quality\u2026pretty much everything.\nFirstly, the game is clearly a console port \u2013 a bad one at that. Controls do not \u2018feel\u2019 right for a PC game and some simple elements (such as climbing in natural environments) are just awful. The user interface suffers from poor choices, likely as a result of being a console import \u2013 whereas you can imagine cycling through menus with a keypad and console buttons, it translates poorly to a keyboard and mouse setup. Choices made with how movement works are also poor \u2013 the highly user-controllable run/jump of the earlier versions has been destroyed in AC3, and you will now automatically climb and wall you run into.\nSecondly, there are too many cut scenes (perhaps an order of magnitude more than earlier AC games) which don\u2019t add a great deal to the game. Way, way too many cutscenes. The story line and action feels *far* more linear than previous editions, and is very trying at times. Despite being open world, there are only a few instances where this seems to be an advantage, rather mostly you feel like you\u2019re travelling from one area to the next without reward, or through a semi-closed system \u2013 probably a legacy of the storyline issues.\nThere\u2019s also issues with how intuitive missions are \u2013 you\u2019re always on a stream of linear missions, but it\u2019s not necessarily clear exactly what you have to do. This isn\u2019t because you have to \u2018discover\u2019 what to do (which might be fun) but rather because the storyline breaks down badly at the scenario level. The voice acting is variable \u2013 some OK, some absolutely awful. The choice to swap between characters doesn\u2019t work well, and leads to a disjointed story where you feel that you start the game, and then start again down the track, all to institute a plot twist which is interesting for all of ten seconds.\nThirdly, some bizarre choices have been made with regards to combat - I\u2019d rather face 15 redcoats (which I will defeat easily) than 1 wolf (who you cannot fight in direct combat but only either stealth kill or kill with ranged weapons). Until you learn how to defeat champion characters (such as captains) it\u2019s highly frustrating, but once you master the simple technique it\u2019s actually a little too easy.\nFourthly \u2013 some really fun elements from earlier ACs (such as finding all the flags, etc.) have been replaced with much clumsier mechanisms, which takes some fun out of the game for those who enjoyed this aspect. Perhaps most disappointingly \u2013 the jumping puzzles that were developing so well across the first four ACs (particularly the first three) have been removed with movement and jumping being frankly a bore.\nFifthly \u2013 perhaps worst of all \u2013 the stealth element is gone from the game. It\u2019s not a \u2018sneak around and assassinate people\u2019 game, it\u2019s more of an open combat game, which is well and good for other games, but removes one of the fundamental (and most enjoyable) aspects of earlier AC games.\nUbisoft should feel a deep shame about releasing this game\u2026it\u2019s a stinker. I cannot fathom the positive reviews this game has received from some critics. I\u2019d warn those \u2013 particularly those who enjoyed the earlier AC games \u2013 to stay away from this abomination. Would not recommend even if the game including all DLC were available for $1.99.

And i played this game 2 times now. ( the 30 hours i played was only one playthrough! And i still have only 44% completion)\nDesmond's story is also amazing!\ngameplay:\nSince the you know have a frontier you can parkour in trees! You can still acces rooftops in New York and Boston. The combat has changed. It's really has a different vibe. Connor can use a sword, tomahawk or a club. He can also use some more weapons but i don't remember. Connor also possess a robe dart. He can use it to let his enemies come closer or to hang them (wich looks amazing!). Connor also has a bow, a gun and bait and a trap. He can also use trap mines. however, i never used them. Hunting is a way to  earn money. You can explore the frontier and hunt for animals. It works very good. Instead of what ac 4 did (they let us see the area where an animal lived) You know had to find the animals in the frontier to add this information to your map.\ngraphics:\nThis game came out in 2012. So the graphics aren't stunning anymore. However, this game looks better on my pc than ac 4 because i just can't run ac4 on anything above medium. I just can't.\nVerdict:\nI would recommend this game to most people. Assassin's creed is an amazing franchise (imo).

If you are specifically trying to play the AC games in order so as to follow Desmond's plot, then by all means play this game; but when considered in terms of whether this game is actually worth your time as a game, independent of its significance to a plotline you're following? Don't bother.\nThe game has pretty graphics, and animals and hunting, and all sorts of things that are all well and good, but ultimately feels like a rather lazy attempt at an AC game. For ease of reading, here's a list of my complaints thus far*:\n-Control of your character has been paired down to 2 buttons, leaving most situations feeling either too simple or too constraining.\n-Combat controls are less fluid than previous games (in part as a consequence of only using 2 buttons)\n-Much of the wholly new content feels gimmicky or half-complete, with the exception of the naval stuff. The naval stuff still suffers from some of the other problems, but it's definitely fun and new content.\n-Totally phoned-in voice acting\n-Terribly written; glaring plot holes, and confusing or poorly justified character motives\n-bizarrely obvious tropes; like playing through a mixtape of overused scenes from super-generic movies.\n-1 dimensional protagonist (looking at other reviews, this persists throughout the game)\n-Main character assumes an Irish name rooted in a celtic word so that he may more easily pass as an Italian or Spaniard... seriously, this is the reason given. -_-;\n*I currently have 16.8 hrs on record. Despite my 'no' review, I do intend to finish this game. If at any point I feel this review needs revision, or my opinion of the game has changed I will do so immediately, but unfortunately I suspect this will wind up being my final verdict.", "hours": 19.7, "user_id": "76561198097184997", "username": "Sarrin", "products": 357, "early_access": false}

I've seen literal pieces of wood, that had more expression then Connor Kenway. He shows the most expression when people die, and other than those moments, he is extremely lifeless. The most fun thing you do is (Hence the title of the F*cking game) assassinate people, and you only do that half the time. The other half is spent trailing people who stole some damn tools (Or other things) from your BFFs, and eavesdropping on redcoats and your BFF's neighbors. The mechanics they create are dysfunctional most of the time, and are only remotely useful in the tutorial they give you on that gameplay mechanic. And if you try to get 100% sync like I did, then you too are going to hate this game as much as I do.Then Ubisoft throws the abomination, that is Uplay, into the mix... Uplay is a really crappy service that Ubisoft forces you to download on your computer, to play this game. In fact, I lost my main save file (that I spent hours on) because Uplay couldn't do the simple damn task of syncing the game with my already existing save file. I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone. If you want a good Assassins Creed game, check out Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. It has an interesting, witty protagonist, fun story that isn't completely obsessed with the whole templar and assassins business, fun gameplay mechanics (Especially with the ships), actually has you assassinate people (But you still have to do trailing missions once in a while), and is just a nicer step back from saving the world from the templars.

Assassin's Creed 3 is a great game overall though it has it's problems.\nPros:\n- The Protagonist. Connor is as badass as the previous assassins and the most brutal yet. You care about him and his motivations because you experience his tragedy at his young age and want as much revenge as he does.\n- The Story. Even though the story can drag a little bit during the mid section of the game, Assassin's Creed 3 still has in my opinion the best antagonists so far(not counting the games that has come out after this one). The characters are well acted, you understand Connors and the templars motives even better in this game and that makes it for an even more intriguing experience.\n- The World. The game takes place during the American Revolution. You can roam freely in New York, Boston and the Frontier where the indians and most of the war takes place. You also have your little hometown called Davenport Homestead which you build up from the ground.\n- Fighting System. So many new weapons and cool moves you can do in this game which makes for an even more fluid gameplay and rewarding gameplay experience.\n- Last but not least the naval sections. This was the best part of the game, no wonder why they made a whole game(Black Flag) based on the reactions from the naval gameplay.\nCons:\n- Gitches. As I played through the game, i stumbled upon many glitches mainly in the frontier. They were not game breaking though, only annoying at best.\n- Side Quests. Some of them were nice though the rest are garbage. It's just about going around in different maps and picking up feathers or unlocking chests like in the previous ones. Not fun at all. This is also very time consuming. If you skip most of the sidequests and only go for the good ones and the story, then you'll get about 30-40 hours gameplay.\n- Hunting. Even though It's fun to go around hunting in the frontier, it still feels useless because the only thing you can do is sell or craft mostly useless stuff from this. It gets old fast.\n- Horses. I hated the damn horses in this game. They were so annoying to roam around with, ESPECIALLY in the Frontier. Such a bad coded horsie. I ran most of the time instead of using the damn horses.\nIf the sidequests were good and actually added something to the overall story, if hunting was more meaningful than it is and without the glitches I'd probably give this game a 10/10 though because of all this I give it a solid 8/10.

I once played this game when it came out and throughly enjoyed it.The story in this game is also very enjoyable one. it takes time to start up but once you get past all the crap the story then starts to take off. The game takes place during the American Revolution and is about a half Native American, have british Assassin named Connor Kenway. Connor is a very strict and disciplined assassins. He is a lot more serious than previous assassins, which can make him less relatable or likeable, but is overall an enjoyable assassin who is constantly in worse and worse situations.The game also has optional objectives during missions to add more replayablity to game, and gives the player more to do.\nThe game has an amazing open world, you can do things from Hunting Naval Warfare, Capturing Bases. You can also do things in side missions like recruiting assassins,and a series of  missions based on the homestead and so much more. They're also a series collectibles to gather that involve feathers, peglegs trinkets that also leads to its own series of side missions, and almanac pages.\nEven though the game is rather impressive, it struggles to provide an interesting way to navigate its environment in the city.This is because in this game you navigate the city through parkour or free running, which means that you will be spending most of your time on the rooftops atleast in previous AC games. With this game you will be finding yourself running in the streets like a commoner instead of the other option, due to the fact that they're an unnecessary amount of gurads on the building, grouping ion 3sor 2s and also spawn way more often than in previous AC games.The buildings in the game are also very spaced out, this makes it so (if you do decide to take the rooftops)that you will constantly falling to the ground before reaching your objective. This can really make the game boring while running from Point A to Point B .You will most likely be using the option of taking the streets or riding your horse.\nThe game also introduces a new playing field which is called\"The Frontier\". This area in the game is the biggest map in the game and with this area introduces a new form of free running, now giving you the ability to parkour in trees. This adds a fun new way for the player to roam this new open environment unlike parkour in the city.\nOverall this game is amazing. It does an amazing job of providing you with an amazing story with have lots of replayablity , a huge variety of side missions and collectibles, and a new fun way to navigate forest in the game.\nOn the other hand they made navigating the city boring, due to too many roof patrols, and spaced out buildings.

The environments accompany the story beautifully and are what I always come to expect of an AC installment.\nWith the advent and wide-use of gunpowder in this era, the combat is still as inventive and fun as always. Being able to use muskets along with the traditional assortment of tools in the assassin's toolkit makes for a good, whole combat experience.\nThe shear complexity of it turned me off completed from it and I never bothered to touch it or the quests in the game. It was the natural progression I think the creative team needed to go but I think they will need to redraw this idea.\nI feel that overall, this is the lackluster title of the series. With that being said, its still a good game to have and a must-have for those following the Desmond Miles storyline.", "hours": 51.3, "user_id": "76561198072889036", "username": "Xaryn", "products": 144, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 106, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-05-30", "text": "First of all, I want to point out that this is not a bad game. Not quite. There are many things done very well, and it has lots and lots of decent ideas. But then again, it was Ubisoft who made that game, and as we well know they have to screw something up sooner or later. And they did. And so, the wasted potential of Assassins Creed III pours right out of the screen.\nLet's start with good things, though. It has a great setting. I am honestly surprised that there are very few companies who decided to use western or semi-western times to set their game in. Although I don't know if this one qualifies as one set in the Wild West, it does have native americans, so for me, it counts.\nI wish it was not, but I have to admit that this is as close as we are gonna get to a good game in those climates on PCs... with exeption of Activision's GUN of course.\nMoving on. This game has hunting. And it is awesome. For a while, at least. It is really well done, and can be used as an easy way to make some money. Includes everything, baits, trapping, and air assassination performed on deer.\nThe environments are as good as you would expect from an AC game. Pretty when you look at them, and while traversing the landscape you will find lots of ways to use it to your advantage. You can hide in bushes, too, which is cool.\nConnor's weaponry has some variety to it, too. You get a tomahawk, a rope dart, whatever that is, poison darts, a flintlock pistol, or even two, and you can even use a musket, and you get all your standard AC stuff.\nOne thing that bugs me, is that Connor does not have to aim down the sights. He just fires, and hits. Every time. But he is an Assassin, so I will let that slide.\nBut all the good things about this game get pounded into dirt by it's controls. Remember how in AC2 you had four buttons to work with? Legs, head, hand and high profile? Well, here you got one. For all those functions. It makes it impossible to choose what you want to do in some spots, when you have two options. It is borderline random.\nFighting bad guys feels how it should though. You got your counter attack, combos, all that stuff, and stats of your weapon sometimes even matter. It is a somewhat decent aspect of this game.\nLet's talk about the protagonist now. Connor. He is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. I don't like him. I honestly wish that I could play through entire game as the templars. Oh, did I mention? You don't even meet Connor until you are one-third into the game! Okay, enough with the spoilers.\nIt does have open world, too... but it sucks. Compared to AC2 or other similiar titles, like Prototype, or Red Dead Redemption (not released on PCs, **** you, Rockstar), it feels empty. It has some intresting sidequests, like Captain's Kidd Treasures, but most of them are boring. Like assassination contracts. You don't get a single target to whom you need to get to and kill. You get five nameless dudes, who sometimes get a map marker, and sometimes they don't. It really isn't what I expected, and I was disappointed.\nWhat I kept coming back for, were the naval missions. Sailing near the coast of US of A was a really nice experience, and ship battles were very well done too... which is why they made Assassins Creed IV. And if you want ships, you shoud buy four, not three. But it was done in three, and I respect that.\nAlso, you can climb trees, now. Thank you, Rebecca. I have waited long enough.\nThe multiplayer mode is there, but it couldn't hold your attention for too long. It is somewhat better than the previous one, but not that much of an improvement.\nAs you play through the game you will get that strange feeling. You will know that all of that could, and should, have been done better. If they gave it more time, it could be a really good game. But sadly, they didn't.\nThe game was much shorter than I anticipated. I beat the main story in one night. Almost. Again, I will compare it to it's predecessor, AC2. Remember the net of all the big fishes in there? It was cool. You had something to pursue. In three, you have five dudes. One of them is just a mercenary. That is what I call laziness, ladies and gentlemen.\nOverall, this game is not terrible. It is not even bad. Closer to unfinished, but decent, still. Nearly impossibly hard to 100% it, and a bit frustrating, but decent. And yet, it is not as good as previous one. And I am not talking about Revelations or Brotherhood. Those do not count. If you want the best in series, better get Assassins Creed 2. If you own an XBOX360 or PS3, buy Red Dead Redemption. I can't honestly recommend this game at full price, but if you find it for 10 euro, you might want to pick it up. It is not a bad experience.\nAssassin's Creed III gets my six out of ten.", "hours": 93.1, "user_id": "76561198028182057", "username": "Old Shatterhand", "products": 574, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

It's a great story and a good chance to brush up on US history, plus it felt like a lot of gameplay elements had been improved. In general, the major fault with the game in my opinion is that if you stray too far from the main storyline, things quickly start to feel dull and pointless. I thoroughly enjoyed this game but almost exclusively for its main quest.\nIronically, I feel it's partly\nthe side activities were optional that they were tedious, in the sense that, had they been cleverly included in the story as an more intricate part of gameplay, this could have become something I wanted to do as opposed to something that I decided to dismiss. In Black Flag, for instance, upgrading the ship didn't feel like a chore--I wanted to do so because I use the ship all the time for basic travel and exploring.\nHaving to wade through the tunnels to unlock fast-travel in the cities is a pain. And there aren't enough fast-travel locations in the massive Frontier region in my opinion (where the fact they decided to implement a stamina system for the horses was an added negative, considering). I guess some would argue that travelling through the world is part of the game, but personally I might have been more inclined to take on side quests and explore with the knowledge that this would ultimately help make travelling faster (e.g. by having all viewpoints become fast-travel once visited).\nTaking out auto-follow is a baffling decision in my opinion--I was really glad to see that appear in AC:R as I could now focus on dialogue while walking, shame it's gone.\nThe ledger system seems intriguing but ultimately is dismissed as it's not engaging enough in the sense it's not really worth the trouble (e.g. I knew it allowed you to create larger pouches, which I would always buy in previous games, but in this instance I just couldn't be bothered and decided to instead welcome to added challenge of having smaller ammo available).", "hours": 78.5, "username": "Flavvy", "products": 716, "early_access": false}

Shout out to the team in Ubisoft for bringing such a game. Its still a very high ended game that requires a decent graphic card to run on high setting as well a good system to sustain the game and for multitasking purpose.\n- Missions are well balanced, the money system is more balanced that the current AC Games, {AC Unity : 2 million franc} {AC syndicate: 270,000 pounds} in a/c.\n- Naval missions and DLC's are fun extra part of the game.\n- choice of outfits and weapons are reasonable, though AC Unity was the best in terms of weapons choices.\n- Recruitment and side bodyguards are useful in big missions or fighting multiple enemies or tough enemies {Ex: Grenadier or Hessian}\n- Combat mechanism is fast and engaging though personal preference of Assassin's Creed Rogue\nCon's\n- There is still lots of glitches in the game, sometime combat mechanism of countering an enemy doesn't work , thus usage of secondary weapons become necessary\n- People who had issues with Uplay being outdated didn't think about installing Uplay first then installing the game through steam, and this wasn't notified to steam for an alternate way to play AC III.\n- Levelling the artisians is explained no where in the game, I had to browse through IGN and steam community to get the solution.\n- Multiplayer seems new and odd, doesn't look interesting, maybe i am not used to it.\nOverall this is a must buy game if you are a Assassins Creed player or someone new to the community who wants to try this game\nCheers\nMax", "hours": 191.9, "username": "Max2Light", "products": 40, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Remaining undetected is atleast really hard cause the enemy can see thru walls, trees, terrain... and you can't even crouch apart from entering a bush where your character crouches automaticly. Enemys don't seem to have health and you have to kill them by finishing a combo of moves  or get lucky and kill them with a strike that passes thru their defence. Sometimes in a fight it gets to a point where all you can do is parry cause every enemy is attacking you by turns and if you fail to parry any of them hitting you, you are the only 1 losing health and they screw up the combo you were having while trying to hit somebody else. Sometimes the enemy kills themselves by falling a non fatal hight cause of some bug. Then there are some secondary objectives or challenges more like that suddenly pop up that are usually a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to fulfill and sometimes almost impossible (in example i had to chase a dude that was running endless loop around town with an objective of -do not shove or tackle anybody and the only possible way to make him stop running and make the story continue was to tackle him. So i got into the next cinematic but after it it said i had failed the objective. :D). Then theres the free running  you will usually end up climbing something when you are trying to run in the streets and if you are chased by enemies you will usually hit a wall instead of the huge door or alley  near where you are trying to go. Navigating in trees is sometimes very difficult and when you climb on the top of the tree viewpoint you can't see very well what's down and where the haystack is. Sometimes you seem to lose weapons from your inventory  and iv'e gotten literally stuck beh\u00ednd some non combatants in a fight in 1 of the story missions. And the game crashes randomly atleast for me. So i can't recommend this game to anybody else than those that absolutely have to know what happens in the story of the game.", "hours": 53.7, "username": "HelkamaKulkuri", "products": 753, "early_access": false}

The graphics are great (I prefer this game's stylings and color pallate to AC4's). The maps have interesting layouts, and the story has some compelling moments.\nFor all of the care that went into making this game, though, it's not well designed. This leads to three problems. One, this game tries to fuse the AC narrative (history, exploration) with a focus on conflict and human nature, but in the end the game just feels like conflict after conflict after conflict, coupled with heaping doses of betrayal. Conflict and jerks aren't what makes the AC series interesting; rather, the series excels when it ties together different times, places, and settings. This game feels a bit divisive and unpleasant, and it does not focus on the strengths of what AC offers.\nThis leads into the second problem, which is the cities are dull. They have no connection to the characters and the conflicts other than being a location. There is little difference between Boston and New York, and it's easy to get lost in these cities because they have no memorable landmarks. The wilderness is done really well, but the tie between your character and the wilderness (through Juno or Minerva, I forget) feels cheap. Unlike other AC games, there is no connection between you, the player, and the place you are exploring.\nThe third, and most grave issue, is that the game is frustrating. Menus get in the way of navigation and are overly layered, and movement is hindered by a system that is way too reliant on context-dependent actions. Had the game been designed better, it would have been more streamlined. It would not have taken an \"everything and the kitchen sink\" approach lessening the frustrations.\nThe game has some big issues. These issues partly make it feel like something other than an AC game. Compared to previous AC games, it's a letdown, but on it's own it's actually kind of interesting because it offers a really good wilderness to explore. It just tries to establish a setting that does not enhance the wilderness.

At least this stops in the fourth Assassin's Creed (took you long enough Ubisoft).\nAnyway, Assassin's Creed 3 was a lot of firsts for me. It was the first AC game that I got angry at. It was the first AC game that I believe has an unfollowable story. It was the first AC game where Desmond's story is significantly more interesting than playing as the Assassin. It was the first AC game where I didn't get a single viewpoint or do any side quests - there was just no need to, nor were any of them on the way to the main quest. In fact this is the first AC game where the heart of the previous Assassin's Creeds' feel completely ripped out; the formula was changed too much in all the wrong places to the point that you aren't even playing an Assassin's Creed game anymore.\nOh yeah, ship battles were fun until you got to where you couldn't complete missions without upgrades. The only issue here is that upgrades cost 12,000 pounds, but I never had more than 100 pounds throughout the entire game. You aren't awarded money for completing missions, and I only got menial amounts from looting bodies or pickpocketing people. I have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to get tons of money in this game because nothing I ever did gave me money, and I didn't have any reason to find out anyway. I just didn't do those harder ship missions.\nAnd there was something about hunting, forgot about that pretty quick.\nIf this game were completely on its own outside of a series it would be pretty decent. The problem is it isn't an Assassin's Creed game, it's something entirely different that could have been condensed by cutting out all of the nonsense Connor went through and shoving the events of Desmond into the ending of Revelations. For that reason AC3 is one of the worst games I have ever played, and this is definitely one that I will never be returning to.

(DLC very good though)\nAssassin's Creed III was clearly an ambitious game. It attempts to cover one of the most exciting periods of history in a brave new world from the eyes of a Native American, a man from an extremely complex society.\nAt the same time the game tries to capture the great battles of the Revolutionary War as well as creating an immersive environment of both city and frontier. The environments certainly deliver with plenty to explore - especially in the frontier. However my criticisms of the environment are that Boston and New York (With the exception of New York's ruined district that fell foul to the great fire of 1776) look almost identical and that there is an extremely annoying lack of ambient music. In previous Assassin's Creed games (AC II and Brotherhood especially come to mind) I had fell in love with the environments because of the beautiful ambient music that had accompanied the game throughout. Alas, there is none of that in AC III. This is especially bad in the Frontier, so much so that I had to provide my own playlist of ambient music from YouTube.\nThe plot of the game is a bit bland and in places I found myself wishing for the game to hurry up and end so I could move on to playing AC IV, however that being said there were many moments where I felt engrossed in the game's storyline - notably during the Homestead Missions. Another down side of the plot is that the game seems to end far too early. There is no big build up to the game's final kill and when the kill occurs within a matter of minutes the game is simply over with no satisfying conclusion. Desmond's storyline is as tedious as ever too.\nHowever, despite those scathing criticisms the game proved to be a sound experience, which you can probably tell from the hours I've put into the game.\nI'd also recommend getting the Tyranny of King Washington DLC (All three parts) as these three episodes liven up the game massively as an end-game option and are in-fact better than the game itself, which is presumably because the DLC was not rushed like the base game.\nI'd recommend this game, but only if it's on sale.

It took me about 40 hours to play, although I probably could have added another 10-15 to the base game experience if I really wanted to.\nFirst off: I dont understand why this game was panned so hard after release. It's actually quite good. It offered a huge leap in actual gameplay mechanics, introduced ship battles which would later be perfected in Black Flag, was a very cool setting, and had a pretty great story compared to earlier entries in the series (IMO). It also offered closure to the Desmond Miles story arc and set the table for the next stage of storytelling (which again begins with Black Flag).\nInitially, you play as Haytham Kenway, son of Edward (who was featured in Black Flag). After a brief stint as Haytham, you then play as his son Connor, who you spend the rest of the game as. I thought both characters to be compelling, and I enjoyed their interactions together towards the end of the game. While I wouldnt say Connor was my favorite character int he series by any stretch of the imagination, I liked him more than I liked Ezio for sure.\nAs I mentioned before, the gameplay was much improved from previous entries. No more jerking you around with trigger controlled cameras, not as much inadvertent climbing lol, more seamless and intuitive combat, plus the addition of hunting, homestead building, and of course ship upgrading and battles.\nAs far as the fleshing out of the world and side quests go, I enjoyed most of them. The homestead missions were cool, liberating the forts was fun, the Hunting Society and Frontiersman quests were interesting and sometimes funny, The Search for Oak Island was fairly epic, the liberation missions added a new wrinkle, etc....I didnt bother to grab all the almanac pages or feathers, although they werent too much of a chore (the ones I did gather). I also didnt really bother too much with pivot points, which are really only useful if you intend to keep playing after you finish the game the first time. Privateer missions were quite a bit of fun as well, and there was a bunch of other stuff that I just dont feel like typing out here that added to the experience and gave a lot of value to this game.\nI mentioned the liberation missions. Those end up unlocking assassins you join your cause and will help you in a number of different ways, both directly in battle, with distracting guards, and actually helping sneak you into contested areas. I highly recommend completing all of those missions.\nThis game marks the end of Desmond Miles story arc in the series, and offers a new arc which as of Syndicate, hasnt been fully realized yet, but has opened up a bit. I thought it was an interesting ending and I thought it worked well with the story such as it was leading up to this game. Very interesting and cool. It also takes you through many of the pivotal moments of the Revolutionary War and the politics behind it.\nAll in all, I thought this was a journey worth taking, and this game really offers so much. You could easily put a lot more time into this game than I did and still not run out of stuff to do.

Puts one in the mood for the Colonial Ages.\nGraphics/Presentation: For 2012, this still holds up to these days and shows only slight aging. The open world is lustrious and blooming with nature, and the shaders don't feel aged. Presentation wise, they captured the Colonial Ages and the American Revolution with perfection in style. Voices are made to sound mostly English, with some American. The Mohawk Valley tribe vocals are done well, minus a few times.\nCharacters: I will mainly talk about Connor here. Connor \"Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton\" Kenway is nowhere near the indepthness of Ezio's story, but interesting none the less. We get to see Connor's life unfold as he grows, from watching his village burn to that of Washington's forces, to meeting him in person and not expecting forgiveness himself, and even up to meeting his own father, Haytham Kenway, the son of Edward from Black Flag. He meets Achillies, and is trained by him in the ways of an Assassin. Achillies at one point met with Adewale, Edward's former quartermaster and at that point an Assassin. So, he trained Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton in these ways, eventually ending his training abruptly in death. We watch as we have to bury Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton's former mentor in grief and stormy weather. This game shows us Connor's personality. How he helped Washington even after the burning of his village, forgiving him because he didn't know better. How he never left Achillies' home to be trained, even after being rudely blocked out by him. He was determined in his life.\nStory: It was alright.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 119, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-03-02", "text": "Assassins Creed 3 is another entry into the long time open world 3rd person action RPG series of Assassins Creed.The game is developed and published both by Ubisoft and released in 2012. In AC3 you play as Connor, when in the simulation, and Desmond when out of it, as well as playing as Haytham in a lengthy prologue. Each character plays exactly the same and there is no differences other than looks. AC3 takes place during the American Revolution and throughout the game you'll meet some historical figures such as George Washington or Samuel Adams. As the game begins you are forced to play as a man named Haytham, Connors father, in what is essentially a 3 hour long tutorial which almost turned me off from playing the game altogether. After that Connor is born and you begin your journey in a small indian village with multiple timeskips as Connor ages. Eventually you end up having a vision about the sigil of the Assassins and this leads you to a man named Achilles who trains you to take up the mantle of Assassin. The game features lots of side options and collectibles but most of them feel pointless and forced so you have little incentive to get them. AC3 also features a weak attempt at a multiplayer component that I really cannot give much comment on seeing as it's dead. The game's story mode works in longer sections called sequences and each of these has multiple missions inside of it. Each mission probably lasts 10-30 minutes and there are maybe 4-5 in a sequence which brings the total game time for story alone to about 12-13 hours. However, I did lots of the side missions and a good amount of collectibles and my playtime came out to be about 30 hours so it depends on how much content you want to play through.\nThe Assassins Creed series has a very basic but satisfying combat system, similar to the Batman: Arkham series, which consists of just countering your enemies then executing them over and over again. There are multiple supplementary weapons such as a flintlock pistol, rope and poison darts, and even trip mines that you can use to enhance the combat experience. You can also stealth your way through AC3 even though, for a game about assassins, the stealth here is absolutely abysmal and lacks basic features like being able to crouch. The fact that there are mandatory stealth missions in this game really brings out the terrible stealth system and semi-stealth eavesdropping segments are just as bad if not worse in some places. However what can help the stealth segments significantly is the AC parkour system that has been a staple of the series for as long as it's been here. In the AC games you can climb virtually anything and you can run from building to building to get where you need to be. In AC3 the world feels like it was meant to be built for you to be able to flow across the buildings but instead feels very choppy. After you counter an enemy you have three options: execute, throw, or disarm them and on some enemies you cant execute or throw them since they will end up countering you instead. Honestly the combat is pretty satisfying with the executions to make things interesting but overall even those get stale after having to do the same things over and over again. Most of the enemies in AC3 are just generic soldiers but some are actually unique and can prove to be a challenge to even the most experienced assassins. Soldiers like the Jaeger, who cannot be executed or disarmed, can prove a challenge when they are mixed in with hordes of other basic troopers. The combat here is incredibly satisfying yet repetitive and can make you either take up your blade in an adrenaline rush or turn around and run away from its repetitive nature.\nThe story of AC3 does a very poor job of both drawing you in and keeping you interested as its pretty boring with no real twists and a very dissatisfying ending. The world AC3 tries to build looks amazing on the surface but once you get into it you realize that it's just the same as every other world that they've made except for the new coat of paint hastily thrown onto it. The side missions in the world of AC3 make you do things like climb across rooftops chasing pages for a book or grab feathers from a birds nest in the woods and these are so boring that they chase you away from the good side missions. Some of the better side missions are based on the Liberation system which allows you to liberate parts of each city and get a follower who can help you out in return. Both of the cities, Boston and New York, are divided into 3 areas and you have to do side missions to free the populace from British control and then finish the area off with a liberation mission. The liberation missions are typically very basic assassination missions with Connor recruiting the follower into the assassins. You can also send your recruits out on time-based missions in one of the colonies which can give you things like gold and pelts to level up your followers and make them more effective. However the problem with these missions is, as I said, they're time based. This means you have to choose which followers to send on a missions and then wait like 10 minutes for them to complete the mission and even then they could fail and make you restart. The Liberation system is really cool and all but I don't feel like it was implemented well and instead was shoehorned into the game at the last second. However, a system I feel was probably the best part of this game is the naval missions and the quest for Captain Kidd's treasure. Once you get into the game you will restore an old ship named the Aquila and become her new captain. You have around 18 normal naval missions, which involve you blowing up some ships or defending a convoy, then you have the templar missions and the hunt for Captain Kidd's treasure. You have 2 kinds of attacks on your ship: Small swivel guns to take out smaller craft, and main cannons for taking out forts or larger ships. You can also switch out your ammo from basic cannon to things like grape shot for smaller boats or chain shot for the masts. You can upgrade your ship so that you can do things like do more damage when ramming ships or gain an extra cannon so your volleys are more powerful. The naval system is very well implemented and really makes you feel like you're a badass captain and brings a break from the repetitive combat and tiring story.\nAssassins Creed III is a very mediocre entry to the series bringing very little new features with it and those it does bring feel like they were shoehorned in at the last second.", "hours": 30.7, "username": "\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udd01\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcf2", "products": 1619, "early_access": false}

I do not recommend this game for people who enjoyed the first few games and are expecting this to be similar. However, I do try to make my reviews unbiased so I will base the rest of the review on the game on its own, out of context of the previous games. So this game does have a nice open world environment with seasons changing along the story line to create a real sense of the world revolving. For the students of history, AC3 has definitely put a twist on the players of the colonial period of America. I do admit that I love scaling the rooftops of colonial New York and the vast forests you can explore. Upgrading your Homestead is also a nice feature. Watching your small plot of land grow into a thriving village. Gameplay there are many differences in terms of weapons and the lack of armour sets, which was quite disappointing, although you can change outfits, they are nothing special. The selection of weapons were not really my cup of tea so to speak and I ended up mainly using the hidden blade.\nOverall, the game was a major disappointment and in all honesty the franchise hasn't improved much over the years.\n4/10", "hours": 38.3, "username": "BlueSal", "products": 188, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Time to kill Templar's, collect money, and generally be the baddest mother#@%@# on earth...  or in the case of Assassin's Creed 3 you're playing as Conner, a half Native American, half English assassin with a personality like George Washington's teeth.. if you didn't get the joke.. it was wooden..   The game starts off pretty slow, you begin as Haytham Kenway.. You play a very boring first three missions as Haytham, which almost killed the game for it.   After a while and a little bit of the old in and out and a plot twist which caught me totally off guard... you're transferred to the real protagonist of the game  Ratohnhake:ton otherwise known as Conner.\nStarting off as a Native America boy you play a very fun game of hide and seek..  to be young and care free..  (I'm sure you figured it out by now that playing hide and seek was actually about the game hide and seek, and not the above mentioned in and out right?)  After finding your friends, it's your turn to hide...  ahh fiddle sticks, I already knew hiding would probably be a bad idea.. here comes big bad Charles Lee to ruin the day.  I won't spoil what Mr Lee does but lets say it's bad, and so bad in fact that our buddy Ratohnhake swears a blood oath to hunt down and kill Lee.  The remainder of the game finds Conner begrudgingly helping the Patriots win the American Revolutionary War.  We meet such amazing characters as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Paul Revere and the rest are here on Gilligan's Island..  Ok, the Skipper, Gilligan and the Professor aren't in the game but that's alright..\nSo without spoiling the game... (psst... The Patriots win the war..  just figured I'd spoil that in case you didn't know..)  I'll go into detail about the various different aspects of the game..\nGameplay:  very similar to previous Assassin's Creed's although this one has a slight twist.  Viewpoints still exist, (only now you can unlock the areas of the map by walking through them, where as in previous games the only way was by using the view points)..  Alot of the old methods of execution and or fighting have been overhauled and made far more difficult, under the guise of making them easier.  The game in alot of ways had the difficulty ramped up, yet the game seems far easier to get 100% on..  I'm not sure why that is, it's just how I felt personally..\nNew additions to the game..  hunting..  you can now hunt and trap animals.. bears, rabbits, elk, deer, bobcats, racoons, beavers (not that beaver, no love interest for Conner in this game), wolves  (I'll call them the Cliff racers of AC 3), and cougars.. (also not   talking about Demi Moore).  You can collect various body parts including teeth, tails, pelts, oil etc etc etc..  The hides can be damaged if you hunt the animal using anything other than the hidden knife.  The hunting is fun for all of about 5 minutes, then it becomes something you'll probably avoid altogether, the little bit of money you can make isn't necessary, as the chest and looting will see you having far more money then you'll ever need.\nAnother new addition is crafting and Convoys...  You can craft various items which you can then use or sell by using a convoy.  The various items you can use are swords and guns.  The convoys are very similar to assassin missions you send the convoy away with goods for a certain length of real time, and when it returns they bring you back the profits..  Taxes (yes even in this game you'll be paying taxes... it makes me mad enough to throw some tea into a harbor..) are taken out (you can lower them by liberating forts) and you have the chance of your convoy getting robbed..  Much like hunting it's not necessary to craft or send away convoys at all, as the chest and looting will leave you with more money than you can shake a stick at..\nBoat's... yes our little Conner is a captain of his own ship..  you'll have the chance to engage in numerous sea battles against ships and relive some of the naval battles from the Revolutionary war..  This was alot more fun than I thought it would be.. You can also find a legendary pirates treasure.. Argh...  only you'll have to collect trinkets for Peg Leg first..  Gotta love a pirate named Peg Leg..  Ship battles are totally optional except for about 3 missions which require it.  Although they are some of the most fun I had in the game..\nHomestead, Conner can recruit various merchants and helpers to build up the homestead.  Each of the inhabitants have a few special missions that Conner can run through to help build the community even more.  I won't get into it too much, but these missions can be some of the best in the game, and  help to break up the serious missions from the main game.\nreturning features..   Assassin's are back, and upgraded..  This time around you complete liberation missions sprinkled around the map, then a special liberation mission to finally recruit one of 6 assassins.  Thees guys are pretty nice to have, occasionally, but ultimately they can do more harm then good.  Especially if you're trying to go undetected and you happen to be too close to the targets you call them in on..  Also back are missions you can send your Assassin's on. Like the previous game you can take over control of various areas... You gain control with the more missions you carry out, the missions gain your crew Xp, money and normally a trade item such as a pelt.\nCombat:  The biggest overhaul I saw was to combat, AC 3 has a much more difficult and steeper learning curve than the previous 4 games in the series.  It seems to have been completely overhauled.  Sometimes they say you shouldn't fix what isn't broken and this is one of those times.  I'm sure in some ways this could be seen as a double edged sword.  While the combat is harder and you run into alot more enemies that require special methods to kill, it can lead to fights which are needlessly more difficult than they have to be, it can prove to be more of a challenge than the previous games.  While it's not so difficult that it distracts you from the game, it does make some sequences harder and longer than they probably should have been.  I was personally ok with the combat system but kind of preferred the faster pace of the previous games..\nThe Story:  I had a few issues with the story, for starters I wasn't really thrilled with Conner's personality, he was very wooden and far too serious.  It was a total and complete 180 to the personality of say Enzio.  While Enzio was running around being a ladies man, kicking\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and chewing bubble gum.... Conner was kind of like.. I want to kill Lee..  It also could have been that Lee is the name of the protagonist of The Walking Dead Season one and I loved that man..  so hearing Conner continually talk about killing Lee brought up some bad vibes..\nConner's personality aside, the rest of the Conner story was decent enough..   With that said it brings me to my next part of the story...  Desmond Miles..  The third game will finally see an end to the Desmond Miles chapter of Assassins' Creed.  This game has the most Desmond play of any previous AC game.. You actually go on a few Desmond mission.. While these missions are fairly straight forward and VERY EASY, it does flush out the story of Abstergo, the first civilization and the importance of why Desmond was being asked to go on his mission.  The ending in my opinion was like.. really?  Is that it!  Five games and this is how you end things..  ugh..\nScore  -  Over all I'd give this game a 7.5/10..   If you liked other Assassin Creed games you'll like this one, although it's not quite as good as Brotherhood and Revelations.  I'd say AC 3 is probably stuck between the first and second game overall.

This game had me saying \"really?\" to my computer more times than I care to admit.  Follow the story of Constonant'hell, the unrememberable dude who happens to have a terrible teenager attitude, daddy issues, a simultaneous unstoppable combat machine (thanks unrealistic combos) who also likes to walk strait into armed camps and allow himself to be taken prisoner.  Why would he do this?  What point does it serve?  Well, after careful consideration I have found the only clear answer to these questions.\nHe's an idiot.\nAs far as why the developers decided to make this happen I can only assume it was to draw the story out.  Holy crap man, this game DRAGs out.  I like a satisfying experience, I enjoy games which provide a long enjoyable story.  But good God man, this game has more points which could have been the end than the extended cut of Lord of the Rings.  Just let it end already.\nHere is an example of the typical play period of this game:\nWalk/run/parkor your way around a mess of colonial buildings and or trees.  CUTSCENE.  Combat.  Walk/run/parkor to another place.  CUTSCENE.\nYou really start to begin to feel like your only role as the player is to be the guy who gets Constonant'hell to his next cutscene.  I kid you not, towards the end of the game there is a cutscene, followed by five seconds (literally) of player control moving down a corridor, CUTSCENE.\nFurther, the PC controls for this game are so head up\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665stupid that it actually takes both hands to keep Constonant'hell moving at full speed.  The lack of an autorun toggle is completely unforgiveable in a game that forces (espcially in the early game) so much manual running about in a boring and essentially useless countryside.  So forget taking a swig off your beer, or digging into some doritos, because if you do, Ol' Constonant'hell is going to sit there, making no progress for you, patiently waiting for you to get your meat hooks back on both the keyboard and mouse so you can make him right mouse button run instead of \"W\" key saunter forth.\nThat brings me to another thing, the completely ancillary crafting system which serves no partical purpose other than to show you neat and quasi useful things you COULD have, if only you had that ONE crafting helper, or some neublous ingredient (seriously, you need rosewood to make a double holster?  Are you freaking insane?).  I was able to clear the ENTIRE game without any of the \"upgrades\" promised by the backwards crafting, and the only thing on there that was even remotely interesting to me were the aforementioned double holsters, which I found out you can't even get until over 3/4 of the way into the game, so why bother at that point?\nAnother thing, I made it all the way through the game with no noteworthy difficulties other than Constonant'hell deciding that CLEARLY the players intent was for him to catapult himself into the abyss, or to run directly through the super fire (seriously there is a fire about the size of your typical dinner plate at one point in the story, and if you attempt to run through it, vault over it, or otherwise come into any contact with it, INSTANT DEATH).  Honestly, why, WHY would the devs of a parkour game not make even a half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665attempt to give the parkour some sort of logic so Constonant'hell wouldn't do such insanely \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 things?\nTo be strait, I was going to give this one a pass, but a friend of mine told me I should give it a go.  He's a good buddy and he even foot the bill on the game for me during the steam sale, and as far as that goes, that is the only time ANY amount of money should be spent on this game.  Hell, it doesn't even properly update the Ubi\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665units for progressing the events of the story, and whoever came up with the idea of putting multiplayer into this franchise should be dragged out into the street and publicly kicked in the crotch.\nTL;DR:  Bad story, bad controls, unrememberable characters.  How this has favorable reviews is something I cannot understand.

With around 50 hours in the game for me right now, I can further add my own Mixed Review right along side the rest.  It's BOTH, extremely good and extremely bad in different ways...\nLet's start with The Good.  If you enjoyed the previous games in the series of AC then you should appreciate this game.  It has exquisite graphics, in depth storylines, abundant and rich characters that develope and evolve, open world feel like none previously, mulitiple maps to continue to explore before and after quests, and plenty of new and unique challenges.  This must be one game in the series that if you miss it you just might be forever lost.  A stepping stone for what's to come.  It must be that game that truly marries, meshes and coalesces the storylines to come.\nThe Bad?!  There's actually too many to count or list.  It never ceases to turn up further blunders of new problems along the way into the game.  For one, I think the complete CONTROLS, movement, equiping and accessing items (in AND out of battle mode) are beyond frustrating and lacks any finesse.  This game had to be rushed by the developers, and it shows!  Two, accessing and retrieving INFORMATION WITHIN THE GAME or tasks, from simple things like inventory, objectives, setting markers on map, even matching mini-map on HUD to larger map that you may zoom in on, your current notoriety or even locations of bribing people or removing notoriety notices on maps are all nill.  Difficult or do not exist any logical way or quick access.  Three, the auto-save during missions save at very odd times within missions, adding to the pretentious feeling of the game developers in over-trying to be different, and only exceeding to further frustrate the gamer.  To be more specific, during a mission it might save 3 to 5 times, but the missions are extremely long in some cases.  You may only be able to either go back one save to retry or you can replay the entire memory (only) to try to achieve your goal of reaching 100%.  So, if you need to, but didn't try to replay that particular segment/ mission before a 5 second window during that mission you just have to replay the entire memory/ mission completely over from the beginning.  I don't like that at all.  Give me the option to save or replay when I see fit for my game style!\nOverall, I gave this a Thumbs Up!  It's good to try to immerse yourself in this beautiful game, but it's also good to take long breaks away from your frustrations with it as well.", "hours": 147.1, "user_id": "76561198054023535", "username": "Catpsyche", "products": 113, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 123, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-02-14", "text": "Assassin's Creed III (AC3) is a very good hybrid game that consists of historical telling, which combines fiction with non-fiction, and modern-day times. AC3 is set in the American Revolution with the British invading Colonial America and the uprise of the Patriots to counter the British. You, the player, play as Connor Kenway, a refreshing Native-American that strives to protect his native homeland from the Templars and the British. Also, in modern-day present time you play as Desmond Miles, an intriguing character that is determined to uncover the mystery of the first civilisation and the relation to the December end of the world scare.\n\nAC3 has many features and various stories that allow the game to shine. I commend the developers for their insight into expanding the backstory. For example, the Templers connection between the American Revolution and present-time in AC3. The modern day story is pretty substantial as that was the only hook from the previous game AC: Revelations. Safe to say, the developers successfully allowed me to further invest into the modern day story by allowing me to experience more revelations and experiences from the first civilisation and its effect on Desmond and his group. Here are some very minor spoilers; the modern day ending was excellent because there was a very significant continuation of the first civilisation story that occurs.\nThe campaign was very good with great storytelling. The amount of historical information in the game was fascinating as it expanded my knowledge on the American Revolution. There were several twists and turns in the story including the story within Connor and Haytham that kept me interested and engaged whilst completing the game. I completed AC3 in 51 hours so I am surprised the game held my interest. A big hit was the variety of missions such as killing an individual to defending a bridge crossing in a battle. This helped freshen the game and expand the story at hand while being engaging because the campaign covered a lot of ground. This included Haytham making his way to America at the beginning to transitioning to Connor and his journey from his small village into assassin. The endings for modern time and Connor were strong. I felt with Connor\u2019s ending and also the epilogue there was a satisfying payoff to his journey, which also concluded multiple backstories like Achilles, which was very good. The modern day ending was rewarding in continuing the story of the first civilisation and the consequence with Desmond and the world.\n\nThere are an abundance of side missions in AC3. Due to this, there is a ton of replayability. There are different types of side missions. For example, in Frontier you will have a Frontiersmen challenge, which will include \u2018skin five animals\u2019 among other tasks. Once you complete them you get more challenges. I did not do them as well I found them uninspiring and boring. Other side missions include several semi-decent naval missions that include securing a trade route and finding Captain Kidds treasure adventure among other naval missions. The trade route naval missions are unnecessary as you cannot unlock a naval convoy until sequence nine, late in the game. A naval convoy basically ships goods overseas to produce profit, which I will expand on after. But naval missions are fun for shooting boats mostly. Lastly, there are homestead missions, which once you do them you earn the ability for your artisans (workers) to produce higher quality goods to sell for higher. These were very fun side missions as there were a lot of them to keep me occupied and they also bring a managerial element into the game.\nThe settings of AC3 are beautiful and vibrant. There are four main areas including Davenport Homestead, Frontier, Boston, and New York. All four have its own distinct qualities like Davenport Homestead is your home business basically while Frontier is where the majority of conflict between the British and Patriots take place. The weather system of snow, rain, etc. allows for each location to strive in realism and to look excellent. I ran the game on ultra-settings so the graphics looked great on everything, particularly the environment.\nThe characters in this game are quite good. All characters have distinct personalities from the arrogant ones such as Haytham to the greedy ones of Benjamin Church. Therefore, it is pretty easy to invest into the characters that are good and bad as they do play a really good role in the game. For example, my favourite character is Haytham because his voice acting is brilliant, his arrogance is on point and his mannerisms best match his personality.\nThe combat is very solid albeit repetitive in AC3. It involves the usual options of counter, throw, block and all that. The main difference in this instalment is the expanded variety of animations. The new animation of killing an individual or a counter attack are solid and fluid and is seamless in transitioning to the next maneuver. The naval combat is very good as well. Blasting ships is a bundle of joy as there are several ammunition types that enhance the battle. I prefer AC3\u2019s naval combat over Black Flag as I felt that was average and this is engaging. Also the movement of the player is also enhanced. For example, moving up a steep surface will be harder to climb for the player, adding some level of realism into the movement. It is fresh as it spices up the movement aspect.\n\nThere are several new neat ideas in AC3. Features include the business aspect of trading and crafting that is fun. Meanwhile, the Brotherhood aspect implements a strategic element. The brotherhood aspect is the same from Brotherhood and Revelations and was introduced in Brotherhood. You have assassins and you send them over the country to do jobs that earn items, XP and money. The difference in this game is the recruiting of assassins. You have to complete liberation missions to eventually recruit an assassin, a simple yet effective idea.  Other features include the map feature which I feel has taken a downturn in this game. It is more difficult to uncover portions of the city as a viewpoint will not uncover all aspects of the area. This does encourage adventuring into unknown points in the city but I feel was too annoying at times. Lastly, the descriptions of individuals, groups and events in the animus database are neat and funny. They expanded my knowledge of what occurred and added some humour also.\nThere are several negatives in the game that I will keep as simple as possible. My biggest negative with the game was the synchronisation between cut scene and game. For example, I have a Boston outfit on in the game but in the cut scene I would have my default outfit on. This has happened several times in the game it really did annoy me and hurt the cut scene that was happening. There are other glitches such as losing your item and having to reequip it at very few general stores in the cities. There are other things such as voice acting not being on par with subtitles for portions of the game. My second main negative was performance issues. My FPS for half the game was stable at 30FPS however in performance-intensive areas like snow and on a mountain overlooking an area would drop my FPS to about 10. The FPS fluctuated so much it did become a nuisance. Lastly, there was the occasional crash.\n\nOverall, this game is very good. I had low expectations of the story but I was certainly blown away by the storytelling especially with Connor and Desmond. The side missions were good filler to occupy time and keep me engaged. The combat was fun and fluid as always. The main negatives highlighted above hurt the rating but I understand it\u2019s a massive game so it\u2019s harder to iron all the issues. I would recommend this game at $30 due to the high amount of replayability. 7.75/10\nJoin my review group if you liked this!", "hours": 56.6, "username": "Antwog", "products": 242, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

So much, in fact, that it was hard to put down until I beat it. The storyline is good, the characters likeable, and the interactions between the protagonist and antagonist humorous.\nI don't like the whole cliche storyline about saving the world from an exploding sun. The cutscenes were way too long and boring. Connor was underdeveloped, and you spend a while at the beginning playing as someone else.\nTo be honest, the parkour and assassinations were glitchy, and it was hard to get Connor to do what you want. Also, you could fight your way out of most goofs, so sneaking wasn't an emphasis.\nSo although it wasn't the best executed, it was still good. Freerunning is always fun, and getting to work with Ben Franklin and other historical figures is a blast. They do a great job of weaving fact with fiction.\nThe graphics are amazing, and the tried and true assassin gameplay is fun, although no Ubisoft, I will still not waste time hunting.\nI especially liked the chances to play as Desmond, because the lack of HUD made it much more of a challenge.\nSo if you're a hardcore fan of the series, get over the fact that it deviates from the second game and enjoy it for what it is: the video game version of the Avengers.

The one thing I hated was the long....very long rides through the forest, getting from point A to point B.

I mean, HUGE. You have a lot of things to do, a lot of side quest to complete and a lot of stuff to collect. Building your own homestead was the most enjoyable experience to me.\nAside from that, I found the trading system more realistic and more interesting. While in previous games you just made renovations and then collected the money after some time pass, here you have to craft items, to discover traders and to send convoys, taking the risk.\nNaval missions are also abundant in Assassin's Creed 3, and they are quire well-done. It was a fresh and pleasant experience.\nStill, there is also a downside to having so many things to do. You can easily forget about the main storyline. And the thing is... The storyline doesn't seem to be one of the strong points of this game. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is bad or boring, but I just couldn't keep myself from feeling that something was lacking, when I was playing. Yes, there is one powerful twist in the story that happens pretty early in the game, but after that it seems like a lesson on the history of the American Revolution with the protagonist participating in every event that had any significance.\nSpeaking of the theme, I'm not really interested in the period of the American Revolution, but, nevertheless, I enjoyed reading witty comments of Shaun about the events and the characters.\nAll in all, this is definitely a worthy addition to the collection of any true Assassin.

The worst assassin creed to date!\nI played the first and the 2nd with all expacs and they were awesome, but this one is quite terrible.\nThe game is well done, polished with great graphics. As a standalone game, an ok AAA game it would be. But the dark side of the force has taken hold of it and teared it apart:\n- The story is REDICULOUS and quiiiiiite boring. There would simply be no USA today without conor the a..s..s guy in charge! yipee whata hero!!!\n- The control are the worst i've seen in any video games. After 50+ hours of playing, i still can't get the hang of fighting and regularly get thrashed because of the sheeeeety controls that seems to have been made for aliens hands or something. Maybe if i had claws it would be better.... Also expect to have hand fatigue pretty fast with a game pad. It was there also in the other games, but it did not bother me as much as in this one. The bad controls are the results of this .\n- Again with the bad controls, the genius who came up with using both control sticks and holding them in an awkward position while smashing with your little finger the farthest button that exists on the controller needs to be shot in the face with a canon, repeatedly.\n- Edmond missions are even worst than before and that's saying because they were already baaaad in the other games!\n- Conor our great hero has the annoying voice of a depressed and angry teenager who is going through puberty. When you start the game and he is 16, it's only annoying and you can't wait to see him grown up! Then 14 years later with gray hairs, he's still as annoying. Also, he is the dumbest adult i've ever saw. He's like a reaaaaaaly slow witted amerindian. Such an inept representation of what they were is quite insulting. I feel insulted and i'm not even an amerindian!\n- The boat missions were actually far better than the rest of the game combined! Too bad there were only a few and they didnt last long (But that's why they made 'black flag' hehehe)\n- The wilderness and hunting was okayish. It was graphically gorgeous and when it rained it was pretty realistic. But if youre not a maniac of nature like me, there wasn't much fun to be had there.\n- The cities are quite boring affairs. Looking like crap compared to the other game. But then, houses were made with planks of wood or red brics. Far from the splendor of rome and constantinople. I think the era was not a great one to have this game in nor the country.\n- The assassins group that you eventually have are quite boring affairs too. It seems like an afterthougth that they added after their QA comments was: \"Man that game is soooo boring it stinks!\" After the fun with Brotherhood and the conquest you could do in Revelation, here it's pretty pointless. After level 5 thought, one assassin can seemingly one shot kill the whole english army on his own, while you can't do that with the bad controls of the game. It's like the guys who designed the fighting mechanics thought: Let's make the fights more realistic and hard and not one shot kills! But the guys who made the 'assassins guild' thought, let's one shot kill everyone in 5 seconds after your assassin buddies reached lvl 5. Mmmmmm balanced!!!!\n- Somehow, even the historical figures are boring people. I'm not sure why exactly, maybe they wanted to make them more normal people which is closer to historically accurate. Like george washington fleeing most battles because he lost them all pretty equally and won one little pointless one that was marketed to high heaven and disturbed the english so much that they started losing more and more after that. Faaaar from the historical 'american hero' we used to hear about. Still, all the historical figures seems shallow. I did love the guy with the cigar who had some spunk while commanding the failing battle. Was disturbed by Benjaming Franklin talking on and on about screwin....g older women and fantasizing about it all the time. THAT was unexpected! Still, the other seems colorless.\n- Guns are useless in this game. In fact, the little gun we had in the other games was far more accurate, shot a lot faster without reloading and was usefull to use. Those one-shot gun that takes 10 seconds of reloading might be accurate historically speaking, but god damn i had time to kill the guy with my sword before i could reload my gun. Or with my fist....\n- The templar looks more and more like the real winners and good guys all around. The assassins seems quite pathetic and with no heart or cause that is worth to die for. When you start rooting for the bad guys, something has gone wrong with your story.....\nSo skip this game and go play Black flag the pirate game instead.

This game is probably the most love/hate game of the series. I think it's due to a few things. One is the amazing 3 titles that spawned across Etzio's time line in the previous title Assassins Creed 2,the initial bugs that plagued the pc port of this game(which are now almost all gone), and the most hated of all...ubisofts game launcher UPlay. Im going to say that Uplay is by no means great but  it is possible to get it to work as intended, so I dont want to count it into this review.\nSo what makes AC3 so great?\nWell for one the series has a great intro sequence, although some complain it is a bit long, it is essential to the development of the story. The main character you play in the story without giving much of the story away, really puts the assassins shoes onto a protagonist not commonly explored and I think is  on par with Etzio and Altair. The game is quite beautiful and does a great job of teaching you bits of history which sometimes spoil the outcome of many parts of the game by revealing too much. The combat system takes the good parts of the series and adds a new set of tools not seen before. Some will say the protagonist is not fleshed out as Etzio was but he is more like Altair in the way he kind of creates himself. Also ship battles are fun!\nWhat makes it not a  10?\nGeneric enemies...only significant characters are diversified leaving crowds with very few models. An example is the native american models which are all bald old men except, for the main Indians who have long hair and are beautifully rendered. This game has tons of plot holes at one point you are rescued by assassins yet you are lead to beleive you were the last one this whole time and it never addresses them again. The combat system is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to learn simple enemies are easy to kill and fun but hard enemies\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665me the hell off when your perfect counters just result in you dying wtf!!!*throw keyboard* The attempted house selling thing (not sure what to call it) is a pain to figure out and not very useful. You can find ridiculous amount of money in chests so looking for those is faster and 100x more profitable than selling things through your home store thing. Lastly there are some history hiccups in this game that can easily be avoided for example... right before you kill an important assassination target his bio tells you how George Washington treats his wound after he is injured and then he later dies. In the game you kill him straight up and it just leaves you kind of dumbfounded.\nOverall:\nWorth getting if you played the  previous ones. Definitely not worth jumping into it with out prior knowledge of the past games. Also DLC is alternate timeline so it is not required to play for story purpose. And lastly a tip for all of you that unlocked uplay costumes...they are not available until you finish sequence 7 your game is not broken.", "hours": 25.7, "username": "Killsign", "products": 118, "early_access": false}

Also, the game takes forever to get going and has tons of terrible tutorial missions (the ultimate low point is when you have to play hide-and-seek with some children). A good addition are the ship missions, which are really fun in the beginning, but drag out towards the end, since there is not enough depth to the ship combat.\nA note about the DLC/Season Pass: It's quite fun, as it gives you crazy animal superpowers that you have to use to fight an insane George Washington, but it's not worth the price increase from the standard version.\nOverall, I would not recommend this game.

You could also hunt various animals which is kinda cool.

If I was an american history teacher, i'd assign this game to my students and have them do a project or test on it.  Also the DLC tyranny of George Washington is a must download for this game.  On the downside of this game, the economy part of the game is so much worse than the previous games...so confusing and they don't do a good job explaining how to earn money from trading goods or building up the house.  Also there are a lot of bugs, in the underground tunnel images for the puzzles won't appear which make it impossible to progress through that aspect of the game.

Wiki the story, read the condensed version and thank your lucky stars you didn't have to play it through. The controls are not sensitive enough, there are too many guards at all times who seem to be extremely sensitive to the point that anything you do tends to set off city wide alarms and they are hard as hell to get out of sight from and if you can't get out of sight of them you can't get away. It is as if the game makers wanted you to complete goals but didn't give you a way to complete them, like needing to enter a store but there are two guards in front of it of which parameters say you can't get noticed. So I find I can open the front door by sticking my face in a side wall and open the front door through the wall, when I come out I have to stay near a guy I am talking to but as soon as I come out I am right in those 2 guards and I can't shake the alarm without running away and running away blows the mission because I am too far away from the guy I am talking to. I cheesed it by jumping in the river and the guy I happen to be talking to just barely manages to stay in range and the conversation completes even though I can only hear my end of the conversation and I am in the water 200 yards away.\nI kicked this game out of my hard drive in frustration after enough time to get past the parentage story and all the tutorials/cabin building jobs to the point where I could finally play in the city doing missions on the indian assassin.

The game is beautiful it ran 720p 30 FPS on the 360 and if your rig is moderate it can kill this game. Got 1080p 60FPS no problem on a gtx 750ti and an I3-4170 processor with hyperthreading. I was able to run it at 1536p 60FPS on High settings so that sould tell you something. Overall the story is great and should not be looked over.\nGameplay: Classic Assassins creed you will be jumping, climbing, stabbing, sychronizing viewpoints etc. So what makes this game special from the past games? Well besides new weapons, new parkour abilities, etc. its the open world. In the American Revolution setting you can go to Boston, New York, the Frontier as the main locations. You can hunt animals and there is also Naval Combat but its in missions and not free roam (If you want that go play Black Flag). Multiplayer returns as well and like the multiplayer from Brotherhood and Revelations its fun and intense so do not skip over it. Gameplay is once again a reason to buy this game.\nBad Stuff: Besides a few flat characters I really don't have anything to complain about the game is Very good. I will say the first three hours of the game is a glorified tutorial that'll make even the biggest AC fan cringe. It uses that to set up the story and its worth getting through.\nFinal Verdict: Back in 2012 I thought this game was worth 60$ so at 20$ on steam you need to add it to your collection right now.

This is popularly referred to as the 'last good AC'. The argument being that future AC games lack the 'present day' element that linked the player to the experiences of Desmond.\nAC3 is a game that stands out. Not only because Connor is so unlike the previous or proceeding protagonists, but also due to his character arc being the first in the series to introduce the grey areas in the Templar-Assassin war. Not only is this the first game to have a first playable Templar - Haytham Kenway is also really hot and classy. (hehe)\nThe previous Templar villains were classic - hardcore maglomamaniacs - easy to hate and deliciously cruely. But this AC introduces hesitation to dislike. The Templars are truly working for a better cause - following a noble Grandmaster of Haytham - who is compassionate and non-racist in his views. The Templars want what is best - which was not so clearly the case in the previous games.\nThis raises question of how America could have been in the now - could Native Americans not be second class citizens as they are today? Could the American Revolution been less violent and more diplomatic - resulting in the first era of democratic relationships between enemies? Would George Washington be less of a hero he is idealised and lorded over as he is portrayed to be as he is today?\nAC3 truly brings out the questions in life - would things have been better if Templars ruled? Are they truly evil? Do the ends justify the means? Are Templars methods something that could be condoned? We had always and still been playing arcs that saw us vehimently rejecting Templars and everything they do. We understand their methods are harsh and perhaps cruel, but will this be the best and only way?\nDo they Assassins really have the right answers to life?\nAs continued in AC3 novel Forsaken - another masterpiece - AC Rogue, AC Black Flag and perhaps even Unity, Ubisoft has taken the questions even further, expanding and also adding to the richness of the AC world with thoughts on 'Who is truly good or evil?' and also the darkness of the AC franchise. Not only does this make you LURVE the characters even more than you would already do, but also make you immerse yourself in history and art and politics.\nGameplay wise, this game revolutionized (another revolution) the system and made it more flexible and dynamic. Connor is also the first in AC protagonists to be able to climb trees. And don't question why his father can't.... Combat is more fluid and even enjoyable - sometimes you just want to go on a killing spree through town. Despite this - do not fear - you can still die and stealth is still important for an Assassin. Although, the constraints are annoying, it adds to the element of the shadows that the Assassin wars wage in history.\nThe open world is almost as annoying as it always famously is - loads of collectibles and the Cheevo for collecting and doirng everthing is there - so good luck with that - even i havent got 100% sync on the bloody naval mission.\nNaval missions are a new thing (yay) - kicking off a chapter of AC games for naval warfare. This prototype maybe quite the dinosaur, but it is an interesting development from land-based combat.\nAnnoyingly, the tunnel system can be foregone with horse travel, but then, its entirely up to you if you want to get lost in the dark.\nOverall, a blessed improvement for the AC franchise - for the day of course - and a brilliant story arc. Though you might find Connor a tough person to like - come on, if your father is the enemy, mother murdered, people not even considered citizens and you have to continue living with all that on top of the fact that you have to kill your own father....who found out his own father was betrayed and killed too - you wouldn't be a happy-go-lucky person like Ezio was.\nEzio was a nobleman, grew up with his family and had his mom and sister with him, found love eventually and had a family. Connor never had a chance - not to mention that he is a Native at a time when slavery was still around....\nAll in all, a great game, though annoying for perfectionists, it is splendid in comparison to previous games", "hours": 157.3, "username": "A girl", "products": 88, "early_access": false}

You travel very large distances toward your next main objective marker between missions, only because you haven't discovered the fast travel point yet. The wilderness looks really nice, and that's great, but there's very little to do in it.

You get to have it all, two cities to mess around in, a ship to wreck \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on the water and a surprisingly large \"Frontier\" section that is a lot of fun to explore.\nTL;But decided to read anyway...\nI really like this game.  I originally bought it and beat it on the PS3 (in my previous form prior to ascension) but bought it in a fit of madness last December during my first Steam Holiday sale... I was not... prepared... nor strong.\nI started playing it again after getting a bit burned out on Unity and I have to say, I think this game is one of my favorites among the AC franchise.  If you've found this review in December 2015, the news is already out about what NOT to like about this title... it's got a LOOOOONnnnngggg intro that you'll need to slug through.  It's got a fairly wooden, one-dimensional playable character.  The main story is \"meh\".  Even with all that, I find myself playing (and replaying) this title more often than I do any of the others.\nWhy?  The Frontier.  It's unique among the AC titles.  Outside of Black Flag, all of the AC titles take place almost entirely within a city.  That can be good or bad.  In the Ezio trilogy, it's a major benefit as the cities you visit and explore are truly awe-inspiring.  In Unity (and I can't believe I'm saying this about Paris, one of my favorite cities in the entire world) it feels almost like burden.  Paris is so packed and busy that I almost get claustrophobic running through the streets.  It's so overloaded with \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to do, and there are so many GD enemies, side-quests, \"random\" events, etc. that you can never really enjoy the setting.  You're always compelled to do something.\nIn AC3, you get to have it all.  If you want to do the AC parkour city thing, have at it in New York.  If you want to Black Flag it, take the Aquilla out for a sail.  If you want to play AC Sims, build up the Homestead.  If you want to be the apex predator of the colonial woodlands, the Frontier has ample prey of all types.  I love the Frontier.  It's winter now and it's wonderful to load up this game and just run around in the woods.  When I've had a bad day at the office, I run around in the woods and then see how many Redcoats I can Predator hang from the same tree.  It's awesome.\nSo, if you're a fan of AC games, especially the ones where you can have the space and time to explore the historical sandbox, this is probably the best AC title I can recommend.", "hours": 35.8, "user_id": "76561198031008161", "username": "Hokie200poof", "products": 113, "early_access": false}

There could be so many good story arcs in Connor knowing only a native lifestyle and transitioning into a colonial life and being recruited by an Assassin.  Instead there wasn't even a transition, he just instantly fit in with the colonists like he lived with them since birth, and in 6 months he was an assassin, believing everything they believed, and hunting templars.  There was a bit of a revege story, but the way it was portrayed made connor look more petty than anything, and that was reinforced by constant childish outbursts.  By comparison, Ezio's revenge story drove his initial actions, but he developed from that, and realized there were bigger, more important things.  That doesn't happen with Connor.  Finally, the facial profile Ubisoft used made Connor look like he aged 40 years between 1769, and 1773, then toward 1780 he looked younger again which was distracting.  In short Connor was a terrible protagonist with little redeemable character development.\nThe main story missions are standard Assassin's Creed with more open combat, and less assassination compared to AC 2, and Brotherhood.  Sort of makes sense considering it's a war, but I think the best part of the AC2 series of games was that you actually used your Assassin's blades.  The first 5 sequences (at least) seem like an extended training sequence to me, so that's at least 5 hours learning to play the game.  The reason I think this game is so disliked is because you don't care what happens next for the first 6 sequences, it's only in the last half of the game that the story becomes intriguing.\nThe Side missions are the most redeeming part of this game.  The Naval battles were heralded, and likely gave rise to AC4 (Probably as good as AC2 in terms of story, play it).  Definitely play through all of those missions, they're a blast.  Secondly, the Homestead missions in this game are the best of any of the series.  You get to the point to which you care what happens to those settlers.  At the end of the game, I would have much rather had a synopsis of what happened to those settlers than what happened to Connor.  The Captain Kidd missions also were fun to play.  The rest to me didn't really seem worth the effort.  Most of them don't even have dialogue, you walk up to them, and they say \"Thank You\", and that's it apparently.\nSo long as you are getting this game during an Ubisoft sale, which happens every 6 months or less, pick it up.  It's not a bad play once you get through the first half of the game.  Other than that, there are better AC games out there, so play those over again first.", "hours": 36.4, "user_id": "76561198127768945", "username": "mrhello3846", "products": 40, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Desmond Miles and the Assassins are guided to another temple where Minerva has him relive the memories of another Assassin ancestor, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton aka Connor, who fought a Templar plot in the New World at the turn of American independence.\n: The game goes back to having multiple maps, such as two cities, a large plot of wilderness and villages, in addition to replacing the economy and your base by a map of Davenport Homestead where mini quests allow you to make your village thrive, giving access to resources you'll craft for export. Colonial cities and forest are a nice change of scenery, and leaping from one tree branch to another feel very different from European rooftops. New A.I. enemies are more challenging and cannot be beaten or blocked as easily, which feels nice after the three past games all had similar Renaissance-based foes. The game finally has a decent participation from Desmond, fighting as an actual Assassin. By far, sailing the seas introduces the best new mechanic to the franchise in a long time, the\nadding additional quests in foreign territory very similar to, but much shorter than, the platforming dungeons of past games.\n: It is nearly impossible to take to the rooftops without being called out by guards who are much more intolerant and aggressive. As accurate as the setting is, the cities and forest aren't as memorable, Connor's story isn't as interesting, and the end of the Desmond story is unsatisfying.

The game had a lot of potential to be great, but was held back by a considerable amount of bugs and lousy design choices. The result was a fairly mediocre game and a sloppy console port to PC.\n+ Nice visuals and soundtrack. The North American colonial setting is new and fresh for the series.\n+ Some interesting characters. Connor was a nice change of pace for a protagonist (unless you consider Desmond as the real main protagonist). The dynamics between the AC characters was good, especially the father and son relationship between Haytham and Connor and the tension that brang.\n+ The colonial story arc was neat for the most part. Even though it was kind of revisionist history, I can see history buffs getting somewhat of a treat with all the tid bits of history given (as well as calling out all the places the game got it wrong).\n+ The Desmond arc was the more interesting aspect of the story. Unfortunately, it has a weak ending.\n+ Desmond finally sees some action, although not a whole lot.\n+ Some of the new combat features were cool and aesthetically pleasing. A dual wielding assassin just seems right.\n+ The ability to choose between 4 different counters made combat feel more powerful as an assassin. Some people complain it was too easy, but it didn't seem like it to me. More guns in the environment made it more dangerous. Also, there was a lot more variety to the enimies than in past games that required more tactics to defeat. Definitely not a game where you can just mash the buttons and win.\n+ Naval combat was a new and fun feature.\n+ The Homestead stuff was also new and was actually worthwhile due to the ability to get the best gear in the game.\n+ Animus menu is vastly improved from past games. No more hypersensitive controls that make you skip where you want to go and generally frustrate the hell out of you.\n+ A lot more interesting recruit abilities. Unfortantely, a lot of them are pretty useless, but some are still cool and gives some variety.\n- This game was sloppily put together and lacks polish. There are a lot of bugs and glitches in this game. Problems with colision, randomly falling through the ground and under the world, getting stuck in objects, graphical glitch (like a good deal of rubberbanding), etc. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game in the state it is in. Totally unacceptible.\n- Some very assinine design decisions that sometimes feel like they were developed by a group of r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d monkies (described in more detail below)\n- AC series has some of the worst controls in the industry. They tried to improves things in AC3, but failed miserably. The controls are still clunky and frustrating as hell. You'll still get those annoying instances where the character will stick to walls when running around corners or jump in totally random directions you didn't intend. In fact, I'm still debating whether they made the controls worse than past AC games or not. It's definitely still bad.\n- They attempted to hide the optional full sync objectives so failing wasn't so in you face (as complained about in Brotherhood and Revelations). The results was the it much easier to miss what the optional full sync objectives were, yet it was still in your face when you failed them. This just created an even more annoying experience with them.\n- Some of the full sync objectives were unreasonable and frustrating. One example is a naval mission that plops you in the middle of a horde of gun ships and frigates and expects you to complete it while taking less than 25% of damage. Another example is an objective to not take more then 30% damage to a pack of wolves, while only being given a fraction of a second to react to the QTE where any failure would make you take too much damage, and ranged weapons were not allowed (essentially impossible without emploiting and cheesing your way through it). It didn't seem like game balance was tested very well.\n- Desmond's story arc had a confusing ending that somewhat disconnected it from past games. It was a dissappointment after the build up through 5 games.\n- Connor's story had its issues as well with things that didn't fit all that well. The story is definitely weaker in AC3 than in other games in the series. It could've been better.\n- The majority of the game is filled with fluff and fillers that served more as novelties than anything fun and worthwhile.\n- Crafting has potential (mainly due to the ability to get the best gear in the game), but was held back by atrocous UI and controls. Needs a lot more refinement.\n- Convoys replace shop investments as the main source of income. Unfortanately, it's a very cumbersome and time consuming way to make income and more tedious than fun. Another poor design.\n- Even though the best gear is crafted, gear is mostly not worth much in this game. The vast majority of opponents are easily dispatched just by counters as one shot kills, which doesn't really account for gear. A better sword would essentially just allow you to kill disarmed enemies a little faster. Gear progression is totally wonky. Most weapons will start off as instantly obsolete. 2h weapons are pretty much worthless. The only weapon that really makes a difference is the kind of gun you have, and that only because some guns let you fire extra shots before needing to reload. Other than that, gear is nearly entirely inconsequential.\n- Due to the above, it feels like gear and currency just don't have a place in this game. This series is probably better with it taken out entirely. They're just unfun distractions.\n- Recruits feel a lot weaker in this game despite the fact that they can't die (but get injured instead). The guild menu is also clumsier to navigate.\n- Stealth in this game sucks. Imprecise controls makes it very frustrating. Also, inconsistent detection machanics also make for a very frustrating experience. To compound this problem, some missions require stealth and there is no options to complete certain missions (not all that open ended).\n- This game gives the illusion of open world, but it's not really all that open, especially during missions (this is a series issue).\n- And if you needed further proof that this game development was lead by idiots: the credits are atleast 15 minutes long AND CAN'T BE SKIPPED. The game inputs literally shut down during the credits, you can't do anything but watch them. You can't even exit the game without a hard shut down (which means nothing gets saved). This is by far the most assinine design decision in the history of video games!\nAs I said before, I can't give a full recommendation, but I can't say this game is outright bad either. It's a mediocre game that had potential to be great but was held back by bad design decisions and lack of polish. I can say that after playing this game I've lost motivation to continue with this series as it seems pointless (for what it's worth). Get this game if you are following the story or are just a fan of this kind of gameplay. Stick with the main mission. You can do the naval battle, and perhaps, the homestead missions which are fairly fun, but the rest is a waste of time and not all that fun at all.\nAlso, this game is a prime example of Ubisoft giving the PC community the finger by giving sloppy ports. Only get this when it's on sale. Ubisoft doesn't deserve full price for this game. It's not worth it.", "hours": 117.4, "username": "Cybercoco", "products": 383, "early_access": false}

Exceptional story telling, gameplay and combat, but was it memorable for all the right reasons? I give it 3 out of 5. Here is why:\nPROs-\n- Updated combat, streamlined, epic and fast. Brand new weapons and takedowns, a whole different style of fighting.\n- Ships! Sea battles are brilliant and a lot of fun. (The bases for BlackFlag and a clear indication as to why that game was made).\n- Story conclusion and 'Desmond' storyline. Excellent and very thought provoking. Not to mention, extremely moving and emotional.\n- Graphical fidelity, AI and general NPC activity being the best it could be, really immersive and well mapped.\n- PC porting. The game has been really well ported to PC. The controls are intuitive and well mapped, any needed changes are easy to do.\n-\nCONs-\n- Conner, main protagonist, doesn't feel suited to be an assassin, more to the point doesn't make the player feel cool or outright a bada*s. Regardless of pangs and pains that we miss Ezio, giving this new kid half a chance and I just can't warm to him. He feels like a kid. Things pick up near the end and where he -does- feel more like a leader, but this is within 30 minutes of his story ending :(\n- Bugs! It's sad and alot of people have said it, but AC3 was the dawn of the downhill for Ubisoft. This game represents a bridge from their legendary game production into a EA-wannabe, mass producing, low content single button mashers. Falling through floors, walls. glitching into trees and cutscene cameras getting caught on objects. Tsk tsk, not good.\n- Lack of side-objective drive. In the previous games my 'must-complete' side was ferocious and I turned into a perfectionist. However, without spoiling anything, the need to hire 'assassins', build up the homestead or complete any of the side missions felt trivial and proved little profit. In the end, it was much easier to hunt bear and wolf pelt, selling it yourself for coin.\n- Little Progression. Nicely leading on to the fact that, really, you didn't need to buy anything at all. I completed the game with nothing but the tools and weapons on my back. There felt like little need to buy upgrades or even use bombs, darts and ropes, again, all so trivial. Hidden blade and arrows, that is all you needed.\n- Poorly timed cutscenes: Whether in a sea mission or coming out of a cutscene on land, too many times have I outright failed the mission because an AI dynamically appeared or moved into my cutscene as it was finishing or the cutscene steered my ship straight into rocks.\n- Lastly, stealth missions and optional objectives, the only bane of the game and the reason it's not 5 full stars. You see, 99% of all missions have some mindblowingly foolish side objective. For example - Optional: Whilst killing this enemy do not be seen, use no weapons, never set foot on the ground and do it all in 25 seconds. It's absolutely pointless and only helps to drive you far away from wanting to see a nice shiny 100% completetion at the end of the game. If that doesn't ruin it for you, the amount of 'detection fails the mission' stealth quests is more than I like. AC1 and AC2 allowed you, the player, to decide how you did things. In AC3 you may find yourself at the whim of rage as you repeat the same scenes over and over because of a simple mistake or missed step and 'game over'.\nThese points aside, if you're like me and want to see a satisfying end to the trilogy, get it! The game is very good, just make sure to take a few breaks to not let the downsides get to you.", "hours": 20.6, "username": "Leothedino", "products": 72, "early_access": false}

Ok.\nI must start with saying this: AC III is my first AC game I have ever played. I have not played to this day any AC games prior to this one so I can not comment on any comparisons.\nThe Story however and the background setting for AC III is my favourite and will always be my favourite, and yes I can say this without playing any previous AC games and any future AC games I may play sololy because the setting and story fall in the time frame of America being born.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 153, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-10-25", "text": "If there\u2019s one image that encapsulates the Assassin\u2019s Creed series, it\u2019s that of a hooded figure balancing atop some skyscraping parapet, looking down into the city below. It\u2019s a snapshot that shows off a lot of what makes these games special \u2013 their incredible attention to detail, breath-taking verticality, fascinating architecture, unique historical settings - but it also represents their limitations. Assassin\u2019s Creed games are easy to admire, but you often feel a bit distanced from them, too, held back from inhabiting these worlds as fully as you\u2019d like to. You\u2019ve always been on the outside looking in.\nNot so with Assassin\u2019s Creed III, which hauls the series across the ocean into a new setting that\u2019s absolutely bursting with things to do. It turns a fascinating section of history into a vast open-world playground, letting you conquer the rooftops, stalk the forests and sail the seas of revolutionary America and authoring a main storyline that puts you in the middle of some of the most important events of the period, like a fly on the wall of history. It\u2019s all about enjoying the freedom of movement the game affords you and immersing yourself in its world, as well as setting up the set-piece assassinations that form the climax of each chapter.\nWhere the storyline missions usually follow a pattern of gathering information, stalking and eventually killing a high-profile target (with the odd naval mission or large-scale battle thrown in for variety), outside of that you're free to do whatever you want: hunt for trinkets, clamber over the rooftops of New York in search of almanac pages, or pick fights with the Redcoats on behalf of the populace. There is a vast amount of content in this game, from liberating Boston and New York to building up a homestead on the frontier to sailing the high seas to just enjoying the outdoors and hunting wildlife. But perhaps because Assassin's Creed III is so huge, it can be pretty inconsistent. It attempts an astonishing amount, and doesn\u2019t always succeed.\nAssassin's Creed III follows hot-tempered Native American assassin Connor for almost his entire life, starting as a tree-climbing kid and growing from troubled young man to vengeful adult \u2013 but without wanting to spoil anything, he's not the only character you'll play. Connor's path often intersects with key moments in the American Revolution, putting him in the middle of the Battle of Bunker Hill for one spectacular mission. He finds himself fighting on the side of the Patriots for most of the game, but because he has enemies on both sides, his motivations for doing so has little to do with their battle for independence from the British crown.\nConnor isn't as straightforwardly charming as Assassin's Creed II's Ezio, and although writing is excellent for the most part, you never warm to Assassin\u2019s Creed III\u2019s heroes nor grow to resent its villains in quite the same way. It\u2019s impossible to discuss exactly why this is without spoiling something of the game\u2019s plot - which you definitely don\u2019t want, as there are some great moments here. There will doubtless be a lot of discussion around this after the game makes its way into players\u2019 hands, but what it really comes down to is that Connor often feels more like an errand boy than a freedom fighter; within the missions, Assassin\u2019s Creed III can feel very scripted and dictatorial, fettering you with rigid objectives and punishing you harshly when you step outside their boundaries \u2013 chase sequences are particularly infuriating on this front. The game is often at its best outside of the story, when it leaves you to enjoy and inhabit its world.\nAssassin's Creed III is very enjoyable overall, but it\u2019s not consistently brilliant. Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions\u2019 unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create. But it achieves so much that you can\u2019t help but respect it; no other open-world game has ever given us a setting that's as impressive to observe or as full of things to do as this. Connor\u2019s story has its lulls but it still tells a tale much richer and more compelling than most other games manage, set in a fascinating period of history. Assassin\u2019s Creed III isn\u2019t as huge an improvement upon its predecessors\u2019 achievements as many players will be hoping for, but it\u2019s still up there with the best that the series has achieved - even if it isn't quite the best.", "hours": 23.6, "username": "Ray Mooker", "products": 3, "early_access": false}

AC III has some kind of a bad reputation, yet I enjoyed the game a lot, and was positively surprised  by how much I liked it.\nBefore I go on, two disclaimers: I am a fan of the AC franchise, have played all titles, and am now in the process of playing through all of them in chronological order. So before I even got to III, I did play through AC, ACII, Brotherhood, and Revelations.\nDisclaimer 2: I have not had any issues with uplay. I am able to start and play all Ubisoft games I own (mostly AC-titles) through it, and the client works. I run it as an admin and have allowed my firewall to let uplay access the net. The ONLY problem I had was that for a few days now, uplay would lose connection to the server. Which isnt really a problem though, as I can still start the games, and savegames and stuff is saved locally, and once you get to connect again, will be updated online.\nNow, lets get to the game. It brought a lot of nice changes to the franchise. To me, what stood out most were the changes to combat and freerunning. Freerun now feels a bit more \"controlled\", smoother and \"safer\". It seems to be more \"intelligent\", even though ofc you still will have a few accidents =) However, I felt much more in control during chases and travelling than I did with older AC games.\nDisadvantage: Freerunning through forests doesnt feel as...immersive or fun as doing that in a town like Florence, Rome or Constantinople. I found it hard sometimes to see the actual \"routes\" through the trees, and in town, Ubisoft seems to have wanted to discourage being on roofs 90% of the time, as there are a lot of guards up there who will attack quickly. So in ACIII, I spent a LOT of time on the ground.\nCOmbat is harder at first, especially if you were used to the fighting-style of older games. However, once you get the hang of it, it gets much easier, and it still is possible to take on big groups of mobs. Whats important is: You NEED to block a lot. Whenever the indicator (red triangle) comes up, hit your circle-key (I played this, like all other ACs, with an Xbox controller for PC), hold that button and decide how to counter after blocking.\nYou need to learn which counter works for which mob. The axe-wielding stronger mobs will hurt you if you try to counterkill, so you need to disarm. Basic mobs can easily be counter-killed. The grey-red-dressed british soldiers (strong) can be counter-killed too.\nNo health-potions here. YOu are stuck with the health you get at the beginning, and at first, it was a turn-off, but becomes much more fun.\nWeapon wise, the bow is added, plus the rope-dart. The latter has a cool mechanic, where you can drop enemies to the floor to execute them, or hang animals. Still, I didnt use this too much, but used the bow a lot...its ACIIIs crossbow, for silent, ranged kills.\nStealth works... ok. Its not always easy to see where to stealth, but both hiding in towns and the forest works, and I did like this mechanism, sneaking up on victims.\nThe township you build doesnt provide you with a ton of cool upgrades or anything. Armor upgrades arent in game, and the weapons I found recipes for werent an upgrade either. You can fill your ammunition with crafted items, plus increase the amount of ammo (smoke bombs, arrows, poison darts etc).\nWhat you CAN do though is earn a ton of money, and I recommend to work on that a bit, as you want to upgrade your ship. At first, the naval battles (which ARE fun!) felt forced into it, it didnt make much sense. However, you can lower the risk on routes for your naval convoys and later, you will do some ship-missions to progress the story, so getting upgrades is helpful.\nI earned most money selling furs, both the ones I hunted for myself, and those my homestead huntress got for me. I bought them off of her and sold them via convoys, and once I had ship convoys, I easily made like 20-30K pounds every hour or so.\nThere are a lot of homestead missions, which can be distracting, but they are quick, and I liked the characters.\nWhich leads me to the big one for me- Connor. So many people seem to dislike him, calling him uninteresting and bland. IMO, he isn't. It makes sense he behaves the way he does. His mother was a bit like that as well... very dry humor, very no-nonsense, and it seems to be right in line with Connors behaviour. He is different because he has a different past. He is no Italian noble, woman-hunting, brawling, like Ezio was. He is a native american with a british dad, who watched his village burn early on, and then went out to fulfill his mission in the outside world among all these other people.\nHe is from a different culture, and is more of a silent, determined, focused kinda guy. And there are some quite funny situations where his deadpan delivery makes for funny dialogues (for example the missions with his father later in the game).\nThe story was quite cool, and you start to hate Lee, one of the main antagonists. It all comes to a satisfying end eventually. Keep in mind that you DONT HAVE TO DO all of the side-stuff. Many people say the game felt grindy, but I left out most of the side-stuff, only did naval battles and homestead missions, and focused on the story missions, and it didnt feel grindy at all.\nHowever, Ubisoft AGAIN managed to drag it out way too much in the end. I hated that, in Brotherhood, you beat the game with Ezio, did all these amazing things, kill the bad guy..and then there is a long parcour-riddle with Desmond. Frustrating, it felt like \"Guys, I beat this game, why do I now have to do more jumping riddles\".\nThe Desmond-parts in the earlier game can be fun, but the end is horribly dragged out. TOo many cut-scenes, the lack of a UI (Desmond doesnt have one, of course) made it even more confusing, so even though the story of Desmond ends here, it wasnt a perfect ending.\nI enjoyed the game a lot, I did like Connor and the other characters (and once you learn where Achilles got Connors name from, and see his reaction, you might change your opinion on him being bland), liked the game-play, the missions, hunting, crafting/trading (even though the menus of the accounting book were rather... clunky).\nAltogether - 9/10\nPros:\n- Great graphics\n- Cool story/missions\n- Nice updates to old mechanics, like the freerunning and combat\n- Naval battles\n- I liked Haytham and COnnor\n- Nice to visit colonial NYC and Boston, and learn about stuff from the database\n- Some nice and creative writing (prison, the hanging etc.)\nCons:\n- The ending =/ Way too dragged out.\n- Music was...ok. Nothing memorable, other than one of the main-themes being a total rip-off\nof \"Requiem For A Dream\"\n- Menu of the accounting book is too clunky to navigate a lot", "hours": 45.1, "user_id": "76561198171238315", "username": "danstew23", "products": 185, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 159, "page_order": 1, "recommended": false, "date": "2015-10-14", "text": "Assassin's Creed 3 to me represents the worst game in the series.\nMostly because it had so much potential. It was advertised as potentially being the game to reinvigorate the franchise. At the time AC3 released Assassin's Creed already had a reputation as being a yearly released franchise with just the same game re-released over and over again. With AC3 we were promised arguably one of the more interesting settings, the American Revolutionary War. And we were promised that the game would feature an open world you could traverse either by foot, by boat or by horse.\nWhat we got was a game that was half finished. The game controls awkwardly with the gamepad and the user interface is much less functional than in previous games. It's only marginally better with KB+M. Things like using your gun, to switching weapons, to countering attacks feels very sluggish compared to previous games. It doesn't help that the combat is ludicrously easy and that it's near impossible to die due to the very forgiving regenerating health. Despite being advertised differently, the big war battles in AC3 are slow and time consuming. All of the missions in the game feel like a chore and the most enjoyment I had with it was running around the overworld and doing side missions.\nThe story is where the game really dropped the ball for me. Nothing in AC3 is unique in terms of story. It plays out very predictibly and it feels like it would've been much more interesting had they been given another year of development time. The first few\nof gameplay are spent in an extremely long extended tutorial sequence which I just want to skip past every single time. The game does get better once you become an Assassin but it really is a slog to get through that first 3 hour milestone. It doesn't help that the protagonist Connor is easily the least interesting character in the game. Who mostly does what he's told and never really comes across as a fully realized character. The Present day storyline is also at it's most annoying in this game. You're frequently taken out of Connor's storyline into Desmond's vastly less interesting storyline to be given endless amounts of exposition you don't care about. I really began to\nthe cutscenes in this game after only a few hours.\nIt's really sad to me because there are great aspects of this game. I love exploring the frontier and I love the sailing mechanic. The aesthetic of AC3 was something the developer really did very well, and something they thankfully translated well into later titles like Black Flag and Rogue. Things like running through snow, to jumping along treetops, to sailing around in the Aquila are all done really well, and I wasn't surprised those mechanics were done by different studios entirely. The American Revolutionary War is one of my favorite parts of history to read about, and it's depressing to me it ended up being used so poorly here.\nTo me AC3 is the worst game in the series. Unlike Revelations which was just dull and uninteresting, AC3 is a mix of things you like and everything you\nabout Assassin's Creed. And it's really sad to me because had they been given more time to work on the game it could've easily been the best game in the series.

Bugs and glitches abound, the A.I. can be idiotic at times, and the controls are far less as convenient as they were with the Ezio trilogy or the first Assassins Creed. Lastly, the frequent little hiccups this game caused on my machine during gameplay were troublesome. Every few minutes the game would get choppy and only pausing it and letting the choppiness pass fixed it. Each of these instances occurred at the same time as UPlay.exe using up more memory on my PC. UPlay is horrible anyway, but I felt like giving this game a fair try. It wasn't worth it in the end, mostly thanks to UPlay itself ruining my experience.\nThe other main issue I had with this game is that the main character you play as is a thoroughly unlikeable fellow. (I didn't like him anyway.) He'd range from unemotional zombie to raging assclown to most (if not all) of his allies in the storyline. He was definitely not as interesting as Ezio, Altair, or even Aveline (Liberation wasn't that great either, truth be told). Connor Kenway (or Rato:whatever:nobodycares) was a horrible character and to be subjected to his comically overplayed seriousness for more than a couple of hours was pretty painful.\nBuy this if you cannot live without all the AC games. Skip it if you're not that hardcore a fan of the series or if you dislike UPlay.\nOh, and I haven't done the multiplayer yet, but I suspect it's just like it was in Brotherhood and Revelations.

It's my least favorite game in the series, so far.\nI'm guilty of just trying to rush through the main story so I could check off this game as beaten and move on to a more consistently fun game. I think that, if you approach this game with the mindset that you just want to play around in the open world sandbox this game presents, you may have more fun with it. I just couldn't get into that mindset, for some reason. Partly, this was due to me feeling that there was not much reason to pursue the side content, since I was perfectly able to complete the main story while doing absolutely nothing else.\nThe main things I didn't like about this game were the bugs, the writing (and, in particular, the protagonist), and its failure to deliver consistent fun at the same rate the previous games were able to achieve. I just felt that I spent a large percentage of the game not having fun and actively having a bad time. This was due to frustratingly stupid mission design, bugs, and having a hard time getting the character to do what I wanted them to do. As far as missions go, the stealth missions are some of the worst offenders. The game does not offer precise enough controls to support the stealth gameplay. Coupled with the sparse checkpoints, you'll find yourself getting very frustrated at these missions. It all just adds up to a frustrating experience, especially if you're not feeling motivated to actually play around and have fun with the open-world aspect of the game.\nIf you come at this game with the right mindset - that you just want to run around and do all the various side missions and activities, I think you may enjoy it, but just know that you're not really giving yourself much of an advantage for completing the main story. And know that there's plenty of other open-world games that are going to give you a MUCH more consistently fun experience. This game tries to do too much, without sufficient polish, and without carefully considering how the design impacts the moment-to-moment fun of playing it. It has lots of ideas for side activities and mechanics that may sound fun on paper but, when implemented, don't provide a consistently entertaining experience.\nI feel like this game could've been improved by having people play it and periodically asking them if they were having fun. They would very quickly discover that a large majority of the play is just boring or anti-fun. Maybe they tried that but didn't have enough time to do this thoroughly because there's just too much content.", "hours": 18.6, "username": "chairbender", "products": 392, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 162, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-09-20", "text": "Story/Plot/Setting:\nThe game gives you a quick intro of what happened in the previous installments to those who may be new to the series. While it does a decent job, I would still highly encourage you to start from Assassin's Creed II at least and work your way up, as you'll be robbing yourself of the thrilling experience that is the Ezio Trilogy. However, if your interest is in the past setting or storyline, you at least will not be lost for the most part.\nThe Desmond plot and present setting in this game is definitely the most involved and fleshed out of the series, to the point where there are actual gameplay sections, which I'll talk about in the next section. We find Desmond out of his animus coma, going to different parts of the world to find different keys to help Juno, a precursor to life before humanity. It's certainly an interesting new take on the modern sections in terms of story, and how the modern plotline wraps up will certainly surprise you... if you haven't played Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag yet (PLEASE DON'T! I encourage you to find out yourself by playing the games in order if you still have yet to play the series).\nThe past storyline is interesting and certainly a treat to those who have a vested interest in American History. You interact with key icons that helped shape the American Revolution and the United States, although not in the same capacity as say Ezio had with Da Vinci in the earlier titles. You begin the story as Haythem Kenway, an experienced assassin with intriguing motives. His section was quite long and involved taking me about three or four hours to finish, and helped to shape the rest of the game when you later take control of his son, Connor, whose mother was Native American. Dare I say I found Haythem a much more compelling character than his son. Connor, however, I feel gets too much of a bad rap for... well... not being Ezio. Connor is not nearly as charismatic or charming as Ezio or even as much as his father. I do feel, however, this was necessary to the story, as english is a secondary language to Connor, and his culture is exceedingly different from pretty much any character in the series even to date. His personality is more in his body language and facial expressions than in his speech, which I should give much credit to the animators and graphical artists who certainly helped with this achievement. Connor is still a well written character who grows in his experiences as the game progresses and the people he interacts with helps shape him into the man that he is.\nGameplay/Content/Controls:\nThe core gameplay remains and is refined upon in this installment. Combat is more fluid than it ever was, and new takedowns have been added when attacked by several assailants. This time around, the AI is a little smarter and therefore more of a challenge than in the Ezio trilogy. Enemies will often surround you and back up their buddies, and now set up a firing line while you're in the midst of fighting, with which you can counter by taking a human shield. There is no additional armor this time around, so the health you start with is what you'll have through the whole game. You can get different outfits, but the store bought clothes don't appear in cut scenes. The new crafting and trading system is a nice feature that you have the choice of getting involved with, though having to attack or defend convoys can sometimes be a nuisance and in all honesty added nothing to the experience. Ship gameplay is introduced in this game. I actually cannot understand why this part of the game was ill-recieved, as my only complaint with it is that it wasn't featured ENOUGH into the game. Having played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag before the third game, the ship gameplay, though improved in later installments, is still solid, albeit treated almost like a side quest.\nSpeaking of the Naval gameplay, the ship content is absolutely stellar! I did every Naval mission regardless if it was integral to the story because it was just so damn fun! Additionally, collecting the peg leg trinkets unlocks additional naval and ground missions that in and of itself is a thrilling experience in both presentation and story, but also gives you a bonus when you find all of the peg leg trinkets throughout the world of the game and do all of its missions. In addition to this, there is PLENTY more to do. While the main missions are the usual \"tail this person, eavesdrop on these people, kill this target,\" new missions are introduced and some side missions return. The Assassination target missions that were absent in Revelations return. You can also do courier and mail delivery missions. No race missions, though. Collectibles such as almanac pages, trinkets, chests that you have to lockpick, and feathers are there for completionists. Hunting is also introduced in this game, though unnecessary for progression and often too easy, especially when wolves are easy to take down and skin, as they'll seek you out if you draw near.\nThe controls in this game, though no different from previous installments, feel a little sluggish this time around. It seems like combat was slowed down somewhat from the previous installments and it messed with the fluidity of the gameplay. I did get used to it, but the UI certainly didn't help. Where in Brotherhood and Revelations your action buttons were clearly identified, in Assassin's Creed III only two of them were clearly identified with the appropriate button. The other two weren't and I'm wondering who thought this was a good idea.\nAn additional detail I mean to mention is that the Parkour in this game is the weakest in the series up to this point. I don't think this could be helped as the location in this point in history is a developing nation, so tall buildings are hard to come by. Forest exploration and parkour didn't alleviate this problem, either. As forest trees tended not to vary much, and the forest environment looks too dull and would often get confusing. Climbing mountains and cliffs proved to be a chore as it was hard to predict at times where to jump and climb.\nGraphics and Sound:\nGraphics are the best in the series to this point. We saw where they were headed in Revelations, but thankfully in this installment they made sure to give NPCs some added life... well mostly. The children in this game look butt ugly. As I mentioned before, animations are top notch and this is helped by the fact that everything is very detailed. The changes in seasons were really well done graphically, and the details with the snow in the winter are very impressive.\nSound is very well done in this game as well. Guns are loud and impactful. Ambient noises in the city and the forests help with immersion. The naval segments are also very well done with the cannon blasts. Voice acting is really well done, even with Connor, who I initially didn't like until I realized why he spoke so on point and slow in English. So kudos to Connor's voice actor for making it feel real. It was also a pleasure to hear Kevin McNally voice a character in this game, whom you may know as the actor who played Joshamee Gibbs in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.\nAdditional Notes:\nThis game has the most amount of glitches I've seen in an Assassin's Creed game that I've played, though I have yet to play Assassin's Creed: Unity. I not only glitched into a rock, a carriage hauling hay had lost track of where it was headed while I was in it and glitched into a building, in which I got stuck in. Sometimes Connor would get caught on the environment at weird times, and although this is familiar to the series, I had seen it occur the most in this game.

After Ezio the Frat Bro and Alta\u00efr the Bland, Connor feels like a real breath of fresh air; a character into the shoes of whom I'm actually interested in stepping. The game makes other significant improvements, as well:\n- Stealth is now actually a viable option, with the improved corner-stalking and blending mechanics.\n- Combat has been made more challenging and varied -- I was especially happy about the increased options for taking down enemies alive, which made sense for Connor, who disliked unnecessary killing.\n- The fast travel systems was made much more reasonable -- I never understood why a game that jumped forward and backwards in time all the time insisted the player must travel to each location the hard way.\n- The old climbing system is largely replaced with the freerunning one, which allows scaling buildings -- or trees -- automatically, without having to make manually make the character jump over every little distance.\nBesides improving the old formual, the game also introduces completely new ones, most notably naval battles, which are just great fun. Managing the homestead also greatly appealed to me, as did hunting; I'd be satisfied with a game centred around just those, without all the assassination business. Overall, the game features more dialogue and peaceful quests: Solving problems in a more sensible manner than just killing people. Crafting is greatly expanded from the previous game, and even though most everything you can craft is absolutely useless, it still adds to the sense of actually running your own little community.\nSPOILERS: While liking Connor, I began to intensely dislike Desmond as the story progressed, and I'm glad this is the last game to feature him as the modern-day protagonist. He embodies the hypocrisy of the Assassin order: People who make like killing is a necessity, when in truth it's just a convenience -- doing things the easy way. I suspect this was intentional, as the devs give no option of using non-lethal moves in the later real-world missions. While Desmond may \u201cneed\u201d to kill the Templars, he absolutely does not need to massacre the dozens of security guards who seriously had all the reason to attack the blade-wielding maniac who suddenly burst into their office and started slaughtering people. Desmond butchers them in front of horrified office workers. And when he gets the Apple? He doesn't make them lay down their guns, or go to sleep. No, ha makes them kill each others and themselves. It is the absolutely maximum force solution to the problem, and Desmond doesn't for a minute pause to consider all the people whose lives he has just ruined for no obvious reason.", "hours": 98.3, "user_id": "76561198049409305", "username": "thing not a person", "products": 159, "early_access": false}

I am really trying to finish this game, if only to find out if it is actually possible to die from boredom.\nThis is the worst Assassin's Creed game to date. I've had more fun in the first five minutes of Black Flag or Revelations than I have had in the first few hours of this game.\nAvoid this steaming dung pile if it is your first Assassin's Creed game. It will ruin the franchise for you.\n------\nPost finish update.\nWell I finished it, and can say it is not possible to die of boredom.\nWhich is a good thing seeing that's what this game is in a nutshell.\nI even started the post game pivot points hunt, until I realised, why bother. Sure it unlocks cheats, but if turned on, most of them causes your game to reset when you disable them.\nSo I played one round of bowls with George Washington then kissed the main game goodbye. (If by kiss you mean the raising of ones middle finger)\n*SPOILERS this paragraph only*\nThe game insulted me many times but the best insult was after I chased down Charles Lee. Connor was massivly injured, and I made my way to the frontier, as you may know, you can't run or fight at this point. However, as I'm dragging Connor's broken body towards the inn a notification pops up telling me to attack a convoy! It then tells me the convoy is leaving, followed by a failure to attack said convoy notification. I laughed so hard at this, but not in a good way, in the kind of a way that said, \"You, Ubisoft should never be allowed to forget how bad this stink heap of a notgame your brand name is attached to, and that every person who appears in the 20+ min of credits should hand write an apology to anyone who owns a copy of this...thing.\"\nThen I tried the DLC game, the Tyranny of King George blah blah whatever.\nThe most amazing thing about this DLC is that I actually had more fun in the first 15 minutes of this than the whole of the main game. Sad really.\nThis was not to last however as I saw that everyone who was noble and good in the main game was now a baddie, and the full sync requirements are even harder. Luckily, the whole story is all just a piece of eden created dream. Which is more than I can say for it.\nSo, after nearly uninstalling Assassin's Creed 3 after the hideous mini game of breaking up the wood mill workers fight, or after being eaten by those wolves at Kidd's treasure Island for the hundreth time (before I used trip mines on the buggers!), or trying, trying and trying again to tackle that officer from above but never succeeding (although I did keep leaping onto his mates for some reason). Instead it was here, after the main game, but only a bit into the DLC I realised I've had enough of a game that isn't actually fun. In fact, after I clicked uninstall I realised how much more fun it was doing that than 90% of Assassin's Creed 3. I should get an achivement for that!\nMy verdict is, watch this as a playthrough on Youtube. If you really need to.\nThen play Black Flag.", "hours": 125.4, "user_id": "76561197976109742", "username": "Lachie =EchoEcho=", "products": 126, "early_access": false}

Sometimes, we fangirl/fanboy subjectively over games and we even develop the ability to forgive any mistake the creators could have possibly made because the game becomes sacred to us. This saga was just like that for me, but holy freaking shet. Just when I thought AC Revelations was the most disappointing one.\nThe game offers a brutal amount of additional content (I know this sounds like a positive thing, but wait until I'm finished). This includes hunting, crafting, homestead missions, assassin recruit missions, courier tasks, treasure hunting, collectibles, etc. This could\u2019ve been amazing, but it turns into a bad attribute the moment it becomes the 70% (probably not the right percentage, but that's how it felt) of the game's content. If you were to take away all of these extras, and you only played the main missions you'd finish the game quicker than Tarzan swinging from vaseline-covered lianas. It's almost like they realized how weak the storyline was once they had finished, and decided to add a bunch of extra activities to make up for it.\nSecondly, at this point the story just feels like an excuse to use the Animus and play as a random ancestor, rather than the Animus being a device to know more about what\u2019s really going on with all these freaky gods and the end of the world. The story progresses as slow as a turtle giving head on the moon. I\u2019m sorry, but it does. I could\u2019ve just YouTube\u2019d the cutscenes and saved myself from losing time and money. Maybe it\u2019s just that I\u2019m the only player who cares about the backstory and people just care about jumping from building to building. Could be. But that\u2019s why this is my personal review, right? Right.\nThe same thing happened to me with Revelations. I ended up playing just for the sake of knowing more about Juno, Altair\u2019s past, the apple and whatnot. I literally forced myself to finish Revelations and the only reason why I played AC3 right away was because the only good thing that Revelations ever did, was the ending. Man, that was good and it instantly encouraged me to play AC3.\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is that I wished the game had a stronger connection between the ancestors and Desmond. That we get the same amount of information about the main story as we get about the ancestor we\u2019re playing at that moment. Some sort of balance.\nMore negative stuff:\n- Uplay. Just get rid of it, for the love of Juno.\n- The naval missions. Terrible, terrible controls.\n- Connor himself. He\u2019s depressing, boring and doesn\u2019t have pro flirting skills like Ezio. Me no like him.\n- The crafting system and hunting are simply pointless.\n- The way you unlock fast travel locations is interesting, but tedious after a while.\n- Stealth.

I was hoping that after Brotherhood and Revaltaions, Ubisoft would have fixed or at least looked into their god awful parkour guessing system that they have. Again I ask Ubisoft and Conner personally, WHEN THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO JUMP THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 OFF OF A BUILDING FOR NO REASON? But thats not the only issue I have with the game, so Ill make a list.\n1.Art: For 2012 this game does not meet the standards for quality, though I do have to admit there are some points in the game that I thought were pretty well made. There were other games that did it much better. For example, Borderlands, Hitman, PlanetSide, Ghost Recon Future soldier. I also didnt appricate the lack of graphics quality but the frames of Arma 3 on realistic settings. But on the good side the faces looked nice, and the trees were pretty, and so was the water and ships.\n2.Gameplay: This is the big one, this is the one that I had the most problems with. Ill start off by saying that the parkour guessing system is the worst, I died more times jumping off of buildings then getting shot by a red coat. Maybe Conner is suicidal after watching his mother die. I do have to say that getting around when Ubisofts guessing system works does add a level of fluidity that make the game look impressive, but thats only done with like 3 buttons, and its very rare for the guessing system to work.  Another issue I had with gameplay was getting confused with what to do or where to go. Now maybe Im just stupid, but I had some issues getting around and accomplising missions. The final issue I had with gameplay, that I can think of at the moment, is the combat system. Here again I ask Ubisoft, Conner, and the entire British army, WHEN THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 DID A DOUBLE ASSASSINATION COUNT AS A NON STEALTH KILL? I could be miles away from any British soldiers, but as soon as make a double assassination on two guys, King George himself is up my\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Also, It felt that I spent more time button mashing than actually making combos and skilled kills. But its damn near impossible with Ubisofts \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 guessing system that's supposed to add fluidity to gameplay, but it just makes Conner look stupid as he dry humps a red coat for 5 consecutive button presses. Also the AI is way smarter that I rember form Brotherhood and Revalation, which would be a good thing if the gameplay mechanics weren't\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 This also leads to questions like WHEN THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 DID THE BRITISH SOLDIERS GET BETTER AT PARKOUR THAN A \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING ASSASSIN? HOW COME THE AI IS BETTER THAN YOUR \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 GUESSING SYSTEM? DID THE B TEAM WORK ON THE GUESSING SYSTEM? Now there are many other issues with game play like the Horses. Just put the horses down! I dont know what happened, maybe the british got a little to friendly with the horses and now the new breed is a little off. Again I ask Ubisoft WHEN THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 WAS IT A GOOD IDEA TO PUT YOUR BROKEN JANKY\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665GUESSING SYSTEM ON HORSES?\n3.Story: The story is the same, their still looking for the Apple of Eden or something, to be honest I dont give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about Desmond and his little group, if anything the game would be better without them. But, for the Assassins story line, I feel that Im having too much history shoved in my face too fast. I feel that I have met almost every important figue in American histroy in 9ish hours. If I play anymore I might run into obama. I know that you met Da Vinci in one of the previous game, but the amount of historical figues was not this much, or atleast I dont think it was, in prvious games. Another Issue with the story, and this might even go under gameplay, is there was so much to do. The amout of stuff to do wasnt the issue, it was the game was so unappealing that I didnt want to give anything else other than the main quest for completion any attention.\n4.Characters: The characters are B grade at best. I dont know of any major actors in the game but most of the Dialog is carried out in warm, inviting  lyrical setences that immerse me into the view changing story. Speaking of which, British guy that works with Desmond, GO \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 YOURSELF. Conner is about as warm and inviting as a cup of cold\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and his personality is about as deeps and fufilling as a puddle in Ethopia, and for the record  so are most of the historical figues. Haythin was probably the most intresting character, but again I hadnt played far enough to see him as the bad guy. Charles was also an intresting character, not because he had deep moral views, or an intresting story line, but because Ubisoft managed to fit all that\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665into one middle aged man. Ubisoft also managed to kill of my favorite character, The hot Native chick that Haythin \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed. That was about the point where I started to lose intrest, but I digress.\nIn conclusion this game was not very good In my opinion, There is potential in the idea of the game, but Ubisoft just said \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 all and remade the same game with the same issues. Now a proper conclusion would have a paragraph, but I think I have said enough, and Ill say it agin Assassin's Creed 3 is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game that I will not finish.

What most people say is bad about this game is true (dull lead character, boring setting, not as hype as the Ezio saga). However, we must look past all the bad things and realize that the good things about AC3 by far outshine the bad.\nAssassin's Creed III: The AC franchise takes its first trip away from Europe as it settles down into the American Revolution. You start out playing as Englishman Haytham Kenway, but after a few hours of gameplay switch over to Connor Kenway, his Mohican son and the main character of the game. Throughout the game, Connor assassinates his way up the Templar hierarchy as an act of revenge for an attack on Connor's Native American village. Connor is exposed to many historic events in the American Revolution, such as the Boston Tea Party and the Battle on Bunker Hill, and meets influential people at the time like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Samuel Adams. The game itself was a pioneer for the sequel/prequel Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, as many of AC3's most successful new ideas were made even better in AC4.\nAnd now for the pros and cons:\n-While plot for Haytham Kenway is slow and somewhat dull, and the beginning of Connor's story is often un-interesting, the story manages to develop into a passionate and bad-@$$ plot due to Connor's strong motive of freedom for the people.\n-Connor is widely considered the most bad-@$$ of the assassins so far. His serious attitude and ideals of freedom make him the clear embodiment of determination of justice.\n-Connor's new weapons (the tomahawk, flintlock pistols, heavy axes, and bow and arrows) make combat much more interesting than it was before, giving players a fairly wide variety of choices on what weapon to use.\n-Hunting, while not giving many rewards besides some skins and body parts to be sold, is actually quite fun. The game has a very nice mix of threatening animals (wolves, cougars, bobcats, elk, bears) and non-threatening animals (rabbits, deer, foxes, raccoons, beavers), which makes hunting a very enjoyable adventure. Hunting was first introduced in AC3 and was brought back to be just as good in AC4.\n-Sailing/naval combat is considered one of the best additions to the AC franchise. First introduced in AC3, Connor could embark on some campaign sailing missions as well as a few naval combat side missions. Naval combat pitted you against enemies in a variety of ships, with varying degrees of difficulty to sink. Sailing also pitted you against Mother Nature, where battling strong winds, veering around rocks, and bracing against rogue waves is also a big struggle. Sailing/naval combat was enormously improved upon and made the title mechanic for AC4, which was based around pirate adventures.\n-Free-running in trees, while sometimes slower than just running on ground, gives the player a new advantage in getting to higher places and sneaking up on people/wildlife.\nCONS:\n-Like most say, Connor is a very dull character. He shows no emotion besides calmness, passionate anger/hate, and pain. He most often calls Achilles, his mentor, \"old man\", rather than something more friendly. To top it off, his voice (while great for his passionate rage sequences) can be very monotonous when simply having conversation with someone.\n-It takes around four-five hours of gameplay for the story to actually pick up and get moving.\n-The game has some minor glitches. None of them are game-breaking, and most just involve NPC models getting stuck in places they shouldn't be.\n-Lots of the side missions are very boring and repetitive. Most involve obtaining items from someone to bring back to another person. The Homestead missions, while having small bits of tension and excitement are very dull and never seem to end. The Oak Island missions, however, are actually a lot of fun and offer a helpful reward once completed.\n-Without giving too much away, Desmond's/the modern-day storyline is a huge let-down. However, it is infinitely times better than the modern-day storylines of AC4 and AC Unity.\nOverall, though, a very fun game, and something that you can definitely come back to just for the combat.\n8.9/10 AC3 will always remain my favorite, just for all the great things about it.", "hours": 113.6, "username": "Fireworkspie", "products": 24, "early_access": false}

So I started this game when it came out in 2012 and gave up fairly quickly. I don't particularly remember the start of the game apart from it being incredibly boring.\nI finally came back to it in 2015 and found i had played 10 hours of the game and I still didn't have any of the assasins gear or anything (i also really couldn't remember the story too well) So that will give you an idea of how slow it is to begin.\nAnway after coming back to the game I found it to be enjoyable. There are a few things in the game I don't care for, like killing and skinning animals, crafting but there are other elements i found suprisingly fun like the whole ship and naval missions and the dlc animal spirit powers are a blast they are definitely a highlight of the game.\nThe history and timeline of the game were initially another thing that put me off, i'm not sure why other than it just didn't capture my imagination like the locations and times in the previous games.\nThen the character of Connor seemed just too flat, I don't mind the change and well what can i say its hard to surpass Ezio and Altiar but something about Connor just made him hard to care about or relate to as a character.\nThen there is the ending of the game, it just wasn't satisfying at all, and i've heard that desmond no long features in the games beyond this point which makes his journey all the more pointless.\nAfter all my moaning though there is some solid fun gameplay in there, it just takes some time to get at it and looking back at my steam hours suprisingly this game has the most hours for me even though i like it the least. So that really shows there is plenty to do in the game.\nSo If you haven't played much assasins creed and have the patience i'd say you will enjoy the game. If you have just finished playing the last few assasins creed games and are jumping into this for the first time.

This game looks good for the time it was released however it has meh optimaisation even though it isnt as bad as Unity. Firstly, I have an AMD R9 280X and an I5 4590. I put the game to very high anti alliasing and then viola my whole screen is messed up and glitched. I had to end up playing on high AA and ended up using SMAA from sweet FX. Futhermore this game has weird FPS drops. In Boston market place I get 20-40 fps :/, while in most other places i get 60fps. Poor optimaisation. Also the graphic options are quiet limited!\nI have no problems with the defualt controls.\nNow lets talk about gameplay. The AC franchise is known for its roof running mechanics. However in ACIII they have decided to add in the ability to climb trees and free run on trees which is great. However, I don't understand why there are so many guards on rooftops in Boston and New York. I preety much can't free run on roofs in a city for fun which sucks imo. Also this game has so many new features and has so much. However I don't want to use a lot of these things. For example I had no reason to use the crafting system,optional naval missions,hunting doesn't appeal to me,updating the homestead, I didnt even recruit or use assassins. However, there were things like this in revelations which i wanted to do and enjoyed doing eg. Bomb crafting,buying shops,recruiting assasins.\nAlso, I found the missions fun however some missions would be really good while others would be boring. Also the optional objectives they either add challenge or remove freedom in a mission.\nI don't want to talk about story too much. Basically, the Connor story is \"decent\" nothing amazing. Connor as a hero is quite weird he doesn't really develop and he has no emotions. Also Ubisoft doesn't explain a lot of things and doesn't even give us development or time with some charachters such as Washington. Don't get me started on Desmond... The story is fun to progress through though.\nThe game has a great soundtrack.\nMultiplayer has been removed :'(.\nTo conclude this game is worth it at the price I brought it during the Steam Summer sale. However, I would not recommend this at its current full price (around \u00a315).

Pitched as the game that would answer all of those questions and bring the Assassin's Creed trilogy (pentalogy?) to a stunning conclusion. The only problem is that of course it didn't.\nIt just left us with more questions, and after playing five games in the series it has left me feeling as if I were falling down a hole that actually has no bottom.\nThere were times though when I found the game enjoyable and fun to play. If you have played, and enjoyed (as I have), the previous instalments of the francise, you will probably get some enjoyment from this episode too. I like the addition of seafaring and the naval battles. There is a feeling of panic, unique to this game, when you see a 100 gun Man of war appear in to view. And it is fun using your more manouvable frigate to send one of these giants to Davey Jones' locker. And of course it never gets old appearing over a rooftop and as an enemy starts to challenge you, leaping on him and burying your hidden blade in his chest.\nHaving said this, in all honsety the fifth installment of the series still suffers from many of the same problems and bugs previous versions had. The story still has a disjointed feel to it and there were times when there were characters that were refered to and I ended up thinking \"who on earth are they?\" You could rush through the main story without the need to fulifil any of the optional missions and in honesty I felt that they don't really add much to the narrative. On top of the standard AC plot issues there are the standard game play issues. Connor loves to stand on walls watching as his target disapears off into the distance, leap of a builing in the wrong direction and jump over an assassination target that is on the move. After 5 years development time you would have hoped that Ubisoft would have many of these issues solved, yet they still persist.\nAll in all I give this game a 7.5/10. I've scored it this high only because I bought it in the sumer sale for \u00a33.75 and at that price it's good value for money. If I see AC4 available for a similar price I will probably give that a whirl too, but not at the \u00a315.99 Steam and Ubisoft are currently asking.

So I think I have had enough time to say something about it...\nPlease, let your wallets avoid this game with all cost.\nThe plot of this is absolutely atrocious. The gameplay is the most boring thing about it. All you do is press the middle mouse button once or twice in a couple of places, and watch redcoats die.\nAlso, there's freerunning, I guess. Sometimes you hold a button and the guy on the screen jumps to places. it isn't even fun or engaging like in Mirror's Edge, you just watch them. That's it, then you stop to kill some redcoats. There was a point in this game that I stopped giving a damn about the story entirely and just killed redcoats. Even that, the most fun part of the game, killing people, is resctrictive. In the hour I played of Brotherhood or 2, I remember just going around and killing civilians, that was fun! But in Assassin's Creed 3, you can't kill anyone on the ground except for the people in the stupid Red Coat.\nThis game is a failure.

For the story, it is told in a fun way and will put you in twists and expectations.\nPros:\n-New Combat System (Counter, Enemy Type, etc.)\n-New Animations (Brutal Combat, Freerun, etc.)\n-Weapons and Tools (Guns, Rope Darts, etc.)\n-Story\n-Graphics\n-Side Missions and Contents (Lots of Them)\n-Pivot Hidden Blades\n-Assassinations using ANY TYPE of Weapon\n-Present Day Missions\n-Crafting (Items, Pouches, Custom Weapons, etc.)\n-Map Area (Frontier)\n-Naval Combat\nCons:\n-Some Bugs (not Game Crashers)\n-Uplay Integration (Might be a difficulty on some occasions)\n-Plain Present Day Resolution\n-Lack of Optimizations in some part of Map (Boston Mostly)\n-Some Lags and Frame Rate Issues (not hardware problem)\n-Can't Kill Civilians Freely (Only using Precision Mode to able Kill Civilians)\nOverall Score: 8.9/10", "hours": 92.1, "username": "Adrielputra58", "products": 107, "early_access": false}

Long enough that I sorta forgot a few things including, but not limited to, the following.\n- I don't like platforming\n- I won't even try getting 100% completion in this\n- I need to resist my inner Scrooge McDuck\n- HOLY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 THESE CREDITS TAKE FOREVER TO FINISH\nActually I remembered the last one and made sure to read a book once they started rolling. XD\nAnyway, you play in Colonial America this time, which ends up leading to less platforming and more giant open worlds with alot of open space in them. And trees. The US was pretty underdeveloped at this point, so it is true to the setting. Still, Boston and New York have nothing on Florence or Rome from AC2/ACB.  And you meet historical people sometimes, though hypocritical discussion about liberty that the 'Founding Fathers' are into is far less interesting than the murderous schemes of the Borgias. I can go on and say that Connor is nowhere near as awesome as Ezio, or that there are too many tailing missions, and such, but really I don't feel like it. My opinion by now is quite clear: AC3 is not as good as its predecessors.\nBut I also get to sail a ship and blow the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665out of people. That's pretty neat.\nActually the only reason I even got this game was to fill the story gap I would have had between Revelations and Black Flag. Seeing that the sailing was good funtimes in AC3, I'm forcing myself to write this review now before I dive into exciting pirate action. Because that sounds like exactly what I am looking for right now.\nThis isn't a bad game. Indeed I had fun playing it. But at the same time I felt like for a game called \"Assassin's Creed\" I did far less murdering than I would have expected. Actually I'm pretty sure I spent more time finding collectibles and doing all that homestead stuff than I did killing people. And that's kinda unfortunate.\nAnyways, it's an okay game. I guess now I am going to get my pirate adventuring on and play Black Flag. Yeargh...\nEdit: One last thing: Uplay sucks. Seriously.

I enjoy the combat, weapons, free-running, climbing, riding horses, etc. I especially enjoy free-running through the treetops. I bought this particular game because of the Native-American theme, though I don't care at all for the revolutionary war period. I also liked the inclusion of cats and dogs. Being able to reach down and pat cats and dogs was an inspired way to increase immersion.\nDislikes with A.C. franchise in general:\n\u2013 \u201cAnimus\u201d concept breaks immersion more than glitches.\n-- Linear story arc. There is only Ubisoft's vision, my imagination means nothing.\n-- Regular instances where the game takes over and player choices are severely limited.\n\u2013 I prefer to create my own character: gender, race, face and body type. etc.\n\u2013 Only enemies can be killed. A limitation caused by playing someone else's memory I guess. You're playing an assassin not a psycho-path...but I prefer the choice.\nAC3 specific dislikes:\n\u2013 Controls need work. Perhaps too touchy. In the midst of running, I may try to jump but instead stop suddenly and pose as if I'm hiding against a wall...but there's no wall in sight.\n\u2013 AC3 has some outfits I like, which I bought as part of a package deal, but use is limited to DLC or multi-player game play. Should be able to wear the items during solo play.\n\u2013 The first 5 sequences felt like a waste of time. I would have liked the option to skip them.\nI dislike forced, lengthy dialogue in games, cut-scenes and quasi-controlled animated sequences. This game is far too chatty. There is a \"Skip\" option for a few of the dialogues but strangely not for others. We are forced to listen to long speeches after killing major targets, and when in the much hated \u201cAnimus\u201d. I play open world games because I want to do what I want. When I want a story I read books or watch a movie. If I want limitations, I'll just engage in real life.\nI have read the argument \"If you don't like the story, this game isn't for you.\" Rubbish! The atmosphere, the treasure hunts, hunting, exploring, action and fighting are all great; too much hand holding, inescapable story-telling and the Animus concept are the only things really keeping me away from this franchise in general.\n20 minute long forced viewing of the credits, without any way to skip them or even turn the game off?! I have a few gestures and choice words for whoever at Ubisoft decided that was okay.\nMost of the game from sequence 7 on, was pretty good.

AC3 is a fun entry in the series for a few reasons: the setting is detailed, you get a lot of American history references, most of which flow ...interestingly enough i suppose. Some might see it forced, but I think they integrated it alright. You have an -awesome- naval portion of the game, easily the best part, and, in some ways I think, it's more fun than AC4's naval mechanics. You see a lot of historical figures, there's lots to collect, do, and see, a lot of decent characters...but a lot of dull characters too.\nMost characters have good voices, decent stories, but a lot of them lack much depth, and only a few of them stick around long enough to justify any depth anyways. Instead of having a tight core group of characters you have a larger pool of more shallow ones. Luckily, to me, the villains were brilliant and entertaining, and Connor really wasn't as bad as people made him out to be; he was stoic, just not rambunctious and funny like Ezio.\nOverall it was a worthwhile entry. Certainly not the best, but definitely worth finishing. The ending for Connor's story was fantastic and emotional...while the 2012 storyline really sucked. It's a game of equalizing pros and cons. For as pretty as it is, detailed and deep, there's also storyline and character shortcomings. If you don't like the colonial period, don't bother though. It's not a MUST-PLAY.

ACIII is a good game. Not a great game and not the best AC game, but still fun to play and worth playing.\nIt wraps up Desmonds Story, tells a good historical story in the 18th century, explores the whole Templar/Assasin conflict from a different angle and Conner is an interesting Protagonist(Not as cool as Ezio but none of them as as cool as Ezio). Not to mention the Naval Combat is fun, the Treasure hunting/Peg Leg missions are nice extension of the whole Assasin Tomb/Prince of Persia Platforming levels and even the homestead development is interesting.\nMy biggest issue with the game(other then remapping the controls yet again) is that is doesn't feel much like an AC game. Sure, the bad guys are Templars but a lot of it feels in name only. The homestead is interesting but does feel very removed from everything else(and the crafting system also feels a bit useless when you realize furs sell for a lot more then more of the stuff you can craft).\nMy other Pet Peeve: Conner occasionally gets Forrest Gumped into things. Why is he there to witness the signing of the Declaration of Independence? Who knows other then Ubisoft wanted him there. Why is Conner picked to command troops during certain battles, despite him not actually being in the Army? Why is he riding Paul Reveres horse? Illusion of Agency? It's a lot of fun, don't get me wrong and it's better then watching from the sidelines but it does break suspension of disblief at times.\nThat being said, the King Washington DLC takes Suspension of Disbelief and tosses it gleefully aside. In an Alternate History, King Washington has an Apple of Eden and uses it to make the US into a dystopian nightmare that he rules as King, shooting Laser beams at those who oppose him. Conner, meanwhile, drinks drug laced tea from a magic tree and gains magic shapeshifting Native American Superpowers that allow him to turn invisible in plain sight, fly between rooftoops and bear stop American Soldiers.

This one plays out before and during the American Civil war, in Boston, New York and the frontier.  If you don't know, Assasin's Creed 3 is a 3rd person action title with stealth elements.\nThe good:\n1. Good controls.  Controls were previous AC games' weekest point, especially targeting enemies.  You character mostly does what you want.  Escept when running fast he often grabbed on to buildings and other stuff when you don't want it, this makes a quick getaway infrequent.\n2. Proper strafing in a 3rd person game.  Well done, other game developers must look how it should be done.\n3. The developers have done a great job cutting out unnecesary hasle found in previous AC games.  I just wonder about the underground - why?  It had no purpose.\n4. Learn about the American Civil war.  Something I knew almos nothing about.\nThe bad:\n5. You kill more people than the plague.  You also single handedly wipe out entire species of animals.  Its just too much killing.  I know its Assasins Creed.  But Really this is too much!\n6. Most part of the game is really repetitve.  Get objectives, kill lots of people, repeat.  The game should have had more emphasis on stealth, not getting caught and offing your enemies in style.  At the end the game is rather bland as a result.\n7.

Most importantly, I will focus on two things - the game itself and the PC version as such.\nFirst things first, I like things others might not like. I'm easy to get suckered into enjoying management minigames even if they're pretty hollow in this kind of games. They're a casual take on what the Patrician series does, but they're often a non-essential thing. Some people consider these an abomination, though I personally like extra variety in gameplay.\nWhen it's done right. The caravans in AC3 managed to screw it up. They went slightly for a trade game angle and botched it. The rewards are piddly for the effort - while your main source of income in the earlier games was passively buying businesses, you have to manage low-profit crap yourself here. The interface is far from intuitive and it gets to the point where it just adds unnecessary micromanagement. I find trade games rewarding on their own but the minigame is tied into the action part heavily and you can't expand your empire from within while the assistance you get from it essentially makes stabbing some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665es a more optimal way to get money. This is the first deadly sin.\nBut hey, it's still Assassin's Creed! Free-roaming and combat, right? Well, I found both rather crap. We get a hunting system with atrociously many quick-time events. This is the game's second deadly sin. While I agree that QTEs -might- work in some games, they are a horrible, horrible practice. I'd consider them a last resort because most of them are lazy. The one game I found the QTEs not too obnoxious and paced about right was Shadow of Mordor. AC3? An example of messing up an already flawed mechanic. That's part of the exploration right there, and it's gone wrong.\nBut hey, at least we have the awesome Assassin's Creed combat, right? Well... no. One word: firearms. I generally loved AC because you can feel like a badass dispatching loads of guards. But AC3 is where the expansion in variety of combat is starting to hurt it. You could argue that it adds difficulty because ez and all games must be hard, and then I could punch you in the face. Difficulty has its place but most people who whine that games are too easy are obnoxious little \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 who want to boost their ego. This is coming from someone who likes Dark Souls. Partly because it's a bit more challenging. Some people call it hard, I could agree with that... and then say that it's not -entirely- that hard, actually and go off on a long rant. Point here is, combat is no longer stompy. While in ACR this point was closer to the end, you have to contend with a lot of firearms from an early point in the game and fights are no longer very fun. You could argue something about subtlety but we're supposed to have a freedom of choice. Of course, it's gotta come with some consequences but that's the problem; it's not strictly -hard-. The problem is that it's somewhere between the golden spots of Brotherhood and Dark Souls - I simply found the combat in the game not fun. For something that puts you in combat a lot, it's a bad thing. The third deadly sin. These two things are somewhat improved in AC4 but we're still talking AC3, where wild animals, hunting and firearms in combat are still\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665  Did I forget about something? Oh yes, naval combat. Do you know why? Because it still feels like it was just tacked on. It's a core and fun part of AC4, in here... well, it feels redundant.\nSo from the other things to say; Desmond still sucks. The overarching plot only shows the ultimate pointlessness of it, because spoilers. The setting is quite refreshing, as the whole estabilishment of the US of A by these thankless colonials is an interesting point in history, it probably could've been made a little better but the effort wasn't just wasted effort. Well aside from how as a game, AC3 sucks.\nI could go on yammering about the typical Assassin's Creed things but, obviously, I'm just gonna stick to where it is in the series. If you're looking at #3 you probably know what the general idea of the series is, and that's parkour, killing poor sods who were unfortunate to get in your way, fighting an ancient conspiracy and/or trying to survive in a hostile world. Virtually every other game in the series is better and AC3 really just feels entirely, completely and absolutely skippable.\nNow, let's get to the real dealbreaker - Ubisoft. First of all, they insist on Uplay. That's one thing you should hate them for, by the way, but they put out a few good games so they get away easy. But the real deal is they decided to take the money from their customers, then take a dump on them and run away laughing. What do I mean? Well, technical issues of course. I got the game to run but then -around Boston- I found the game borderline unplayable. Low framerates and stuttering. Even the supposedly more advanced AC4 runs better on my PS3 - which happens to be weaker hardware than my PC. Even on minimum graphics settings. Even without getting to how they deliberately cut down the graphics in their new releases and can't even make a trailer that actually shows you a game. You have the goddamn assets, why do you spend extra time to make them worse? \"Not making next-gen buyers feel cheated\" is not an option because no one in their right mind would consider a console cutting-edge hardware.\nThe last few points are not entirely relevant to AC3 but they sort of started with it; it's the point in the series when it was no longer running smooth for me for no apparent reason at all. My distaste with Ubisoft's practices aside, there's a genuine problem with game performance here (and hey, consider Saints Row - 2 was poorly optimized but SRTT works very well even though it has more advanced graphics!) and the fact that we're forced into another download managery thing on top of Steam. I like Steam, thank you. Uplay and Origin are both cancer and downright\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 We only just got rid of Games for Windows Live, why can't we remove that crap and just agree to use the cutting edge platform instead? I didn't buy it ON STEAM only to have to go through another, inferior service.\nIn short;\n+ It's still got the core AC series stuff\n+ Rather pretty, all things considered\n- It's still got the core AC series stuff (the modern times Desmond bits breaking the flow, that is)\n- Poor side mechanics (caravans - trying to add depth to the minigames and making a monstrosity)\n- Screwing up core mechanics (failed experiments with QTE and in combat)\n- Bad optimization\n- Forces you to go through Uplay", "hours": 17.9, "username": "Skrecok", "products": 803, "early_access": false}

There are some really interesting and innovative mechanics here, but I feel like the core mechanics of the series were lost or forgotten.\nArguably the stealth mechanics of Assassin's Creed have been questionable up until this point; you're either hidden or not hidden with nothing in between.  It seems like the game wasn't supposed to be about stealth -- and maybe it wasn't!  But instead of making those mechanics work better, they were all but removed.  Even the scripted stealth missions feel like they're more about finding the road some Loyalist commander decided none of the soldiers are not allowed to look at.\nThe combat changes seem too cautious to stand out in the series, but notably the animations can be a lot of fun.  The changes to the parkour mechanics, particularly the flow of certain movements (such as ducking and vaulting), were really great.  If there is any one reason to play this game, it's the naval missions.  The conservative innovation of this mechanic is probably the only reason I'll want to play this game's sequel, Black Flag, anytime soon.\nI lost interest in the story pretty quickly.  Way back in AC1, I couldn't help but feel for Desmond and I wanted to know more about his side of the story... by the second part of AC2, I was sick of hearing about it.  The main part of the plot following Connor is restricted by actual history and seems to lack ambition.  As for Connor himself, I feel like the writers had more love for pretty much anyone else.  His character has depth and promises growth, but never really delivers it, making him a really interesting icon for the game itself.  The antagonists and supporting cast, on the other hand, continued to surprise me until the end.\nBy far my least favourite thing is the way the game ends...  Not the story bits, those were all right if perhaps underwhelming, but there was a 20 minute unskippable intermission of credits I didn't really want to read smack in the middle of them...  and there you have it, the perfect symbol for my experience this game.

In my opinion it's one of the better games in the series so far.\nThere is a great amount of varied content (less than Skyrim, but not far off arguably). The main story is quite decent and of a good length, but it is a bit messy at times. There are also a large amount of sidequests, but as with other games in the series, many are low-key and their sub-plots lack plausibility. Gameplay is standard AssCreed fare - familiar and accessible, but sometimes a bit contrived and poorly balanced. The wide variety of activities prevent things from getting too repetitive. It's almost always too easy, except when the controls and game mechanics are being a pain. Missions have optional objectives for added difficulty, which often works well, but sometimes is more annoying than anything else. Combat looks cool, but usually lacks depth and challenge. The new naval missions may lack plot, and the ships may handle more like motorboats, but these missions are fun, and a great change of scenery. The visuals and sea wave effects are also excellent. The soundtrack is good, even better than in AC-Revelations.\nSo, as always, realism and historical authenticity leave much to be desired, but the game is still fun. It caters well to the mainstream, but may leave hardcore gamers a bit hungry for more challenge and immersion.\nMost environments look decent, and on a technical level the graphics are slightly superior to Skyrim (even with the HD textures DLC), but at the same time, some things still looks a bit dated due to the Xbox360's limits. Like with most console games, the open world still lacks some persistence (bodies vanishing right after you look away, people and even carts spawning or vanishing right in front of you). The detail on the main characters is excellent though. (tip - the low anti-aliasing setting looks better than the high one which makes things blurry).\nThe checkpoint save system is better than many others, but can still be annoying sometimes. As with past games controls are ok, but a bit temperamental and not optimised for mouse and keyboard, of course. It is a pity you cannot have a standard FPS setup and programmable 1-9 weapon/gear hotkeys. These kind of things are to be expected with this series, and while annoying, they are not too bad, and certainly don't break the game. I have noticed a few minor bugs (the odd missing model or floating object), but otherwise the game runs very stable. Overall, porting to PC has slightly improved since AssCreed2.\nSadly the animus combat training centre has been removed. And one more thing - why can't I gallop(sprint) my horse in town?! In AC-Brotherhood you could gallop only if you had the game installed on an SSD (yes, seriously!). I still have SSD, so WHY U NO GALLOP horsey?!?!\nVerdict: It may not be an excellent game, but it is decent, and I can easily recommend it, even if you are new to the series.", "hours": 107.0, "username": "Budget_Security", "products": 83, "early_access": false}

The main character was not the brightest, a flaw I could handle, given he was sort of thrust into the larger storyline - but it made for so many stilted conversations, and pauses in the game for exposition in order to make up for the way the arc sort of jumps around.\nVisually, I really enjoyed the game. Gameplay-wise, anything's better than the first one. The story was just...bad. I don't expect James Joyce or anything from writers, but if the conceit of this game is that every major conspiracy you'd find on\nis really an eternal struggle between Templars and Assassins over alien technology, then the founding of the United States is like a veritable toy chest of rumors and plotlines for everyone from the casual reader of history to the tinfoil hat crowd. Yet the best we get is Oak Island - and that's only if you are willing to explore those sidequests.\nBut between boring gameplay and a story that was too wrapped up in telling and not showing - making me feel like the game couldn't decide whether it wanted me to play it, or sit through a narrative interrupted with short missions to make sure I was paying attention - is a very unsatisfying experience, overall. Maybe the developers wanted me to feel no real investment in the other characters, so I could better identify with Connor, who was also a fish out of water thrust into doing things for others that he didn't particularly care for. Or perhaps I'm just projecting too much.\nWas it worth the $10 I paid? Yes. I got $10 worth of entertainment out of it, and many hours on top of that which I will never be able to reclaim.

The story itself is great, developing more on the ideology of the Templar Order than previous games. The American Revolution was also the ideal event for the rebirth of the Assassin Order. The game delivers one of the most engaging stories of its genre.\nThe gameplay was really good; the combat became more realistic and entertaining with various weapons to play with, combining ranged with melee. It also added features like the ability to climb not only buildings but cliffs and trees, and also command a ship through fantastic naval battles.\nThe graphics are amazing to look at, from the american landscapes to its cities. But are some of the most unstable I\u2019ve ever seen in a PC game. The game itself is unstable, crashing randomly and delivering an unstable framerate regardless of your hardware and with some tricky bugs like corrupt save files and bad synchronization. Should these problems like graphical optimization be addressed, this would probably be one of my favorite games and we as consumers shouldn\u2019t be the ones fixing the game after paying for it.\nHowever, if you somehow don\u2019t experience these issues or manage to correct them yourself like me, the game should deliver you with an amazing experience.

It was a lot of fun going through this whole series but this one really stands out for me. Not because it's better than the other ones, which if I'm being honest it isn't, but rather the hate this game has recieved. I feel like this one is extremely underrated. The intro with Haytham is amazing, it was so well done and parts of Connor's intro were also good. However this game does kind of start to fall apart at times, I'd say hold out on this game until you pass that stupid Paul Revere section half way through because past that this game picks up speed big time.\nThe big problem with this one is that it really does insist on beating you over the head with historical references in a really annoying way. Like the Benjamin Franklin scene is a good example of being very half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and especially the Paul Revere section as I already mentioned, the teaparty event was all the work of an assassin of course and a templar was responsible for the Boston Masacre, wtf. And here's the Decleration of Independence being signed guys!! *wink* *wink* It felt like I was having my intelligence insulted at times, because of how cheesy and uncreative it was, they handled it really poorly. Oh and the bugs, this game has lots of bugs. I got lucky and didn't experience too many but I've seen the reports on bugs, so be careful buying this game, same with revelations, I'd recommend getting them on sale just to be safe. Also, the mission design and the controls in this one are clearly the weakest in the series.\nTo wrap it up, the first quarter of the game is overall good, the second quarter was when things started falling apart, then third and fourth quarter it completely comes together and turns into an awesome story. I wont spoil any more stuff beyond what I've said. It also finishes off the desmond storyline which was done well overall but I felt it could've been much better if they included an epilogue to his story but I can't blame them seeing as how it's easy to run out of time when your being rushed by ubisoft. Overall I recommend it, just hold out on the story and have some patience is all I ask and if you don't like it I don't blame you, it really is a hit or miss game.", "hours": 130.5, "user_id": "76561198055440933", "username": "Transylvania TWEEST", "products": 195, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 210, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-04-08", "text": "Assassin's Creed III is a game of many flaws, but at the same time, it isn't a bad game in itself.\nThe plot is about a man known as Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, a native American, who is on a great important mission in which he searches for a man known as \"Charles Lee\" to protect his people and take revenge following the burning of his village. However, before this, you play as Haytham Kenway, who goes through a somewhat long and controlled tutorial. Fortunately though, these memories introduce nearly all of the major gameplay mechanics, and feature some of the best developed characters in the game. Other major plot elements include Desmond making a massive choice that he doesn't get to make, involving some end of the world situation, and him building his relationship with his angry father. Some characters, especially the leading Templars in the Animus sections are quite well developed, and all the cast are very well voice acted, with some brilliantly written dialogue, especially between Haytham and Connor in the scenes that they share. However, sometimes the plot sometimes feels wafer thin, most characters are very well developed, with exception to some of the historical figures, such as George Washington, and sometimes Connor's naivety can become annoying, especially to those with proper hindsight to what becomes of his people, and the templars (again, Haytham) come across as more likable, which doesn't help. Despite this, the game tells its story well across the gameplay time, even if it does seem to develop very slowly.\nGraphically, the game is extremely appealing, with high detail models and cloth physics, with large expansive environments and areas. However, certain areas in the game will stutter all over the place regardless of settings and setup due to classic Ubisoft PC porting. Although it doesn't make the game unplayable, it is extremely noticeable in some areas within the game.#, and can completely ruin a session, regardless of hardware.\nThe audio is well designed. As mentioned above, the voice acting is solid all-round, and the OST is well done for the game as well. The music changes based on where you are, how many enemies are nearby, or how many are in open combat, and whether you are fighting or running from them. The OST is brilliantly done, and these little features help build on the gameplay and atmosphere.\nHowever, the parkour within the cities is a letdown, compared to both its predecessors due to less to climb on and fewer landmarks compared to its predecessors. Because of this, the flow is different, and this doesn't work well in this game because outside of the frontier tree jumping, you feel awfully grounded compared to earlier and later assassins. Naval combat is this games big addition, and this is the great contribution of AC3. The naval combat plays well, and was ripe for expansion, which thankfully, Ubisoft did in some of the later games. Outside of assassining (it\u2019s not a word yet); you can build on Davenport Homestead and make loads of money. However, this is pointless as money is practically worthless, due to a lack of things to spend it on.\nOverall, this is a weaker game in the series. That isn't to say that it is a bad game though. There is a lot of crap on Steam, and this is not one of those crap games. The length is good and the game plays well, and in many departments, the game still excels far above the average.", "hours": 29.6, "username": "[Censored]", "products": 401, "early_access": false}

Pathing can be another problem where Connor will go out of his way to parkour off of walls repeatedly during a chase resulting in plenty of frustration. At one point the game locked me in some grey void causing me to have to close and re-open the game.\nGoing for $5 it is definitely worth the price, despite its many many flaws.

They are no longer just evil people who want nothing but the world under their boots, in ac 3 not all of them a all that bad. some are purely evil \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s, some are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s but are actually doing good and noble things and some are just plain good. Now thats great and all but its ruined because connor only looks at the phrase templar and gets triggered to the point where he will just outright kill them. Nearly every major character tells him that his ways are bad and that he is being foolish to which connor would just respond to that as if they said \"good job now go kill more templars also keep up that brooting attitude\"\nanyways i would only suggest the game during a steam sale or if you really like asassins creed gameplay", "hours": 81.2, "user_id": "76561198080881144", "username": "A Salty Jar Of Salted Salt", "products": 99, "early_access": false}

Firstly just playing through the storyline is incredibly boring, I have absolutely no compassion for the characters, or their goals. Not to mention the ridiculously annoying cutscenes, playing this game is like watching a boring movie, the number of cutscenes quite frankly baffles me, they are simply boring and have no place in the game. Another thing that I must mention is the poor quality of the cities. In Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, I felt as if the cities were actual cities, yet here they are like small towns, the building's do not feel as if they belong in an urban city environment, and for that the cities are awful.\nThe gameplay pains me even moreso, when I'm not dealing with bugs such as losing control of Connor, falling through the world, or something involving the incredibly buggy NPCs then I'm trying to wrap my head around why Ubisoft made the decisions it did with this game. For some reason unbeknownst to me Ubisoft thought it would be a good idea to combine the sprinting and parkour under one key, which is a real bother when you're running through the streets and find yourself jumping upon carts, up walls and other such places. To me it seems completely unnecessary to make this change. In Assassin's Creed 2 you could purchase health vials, to be used in combat, another feature removed which was beneficial to gameplay.\nAnother fault which I've found with the game is the poor performance, this is one of the most irritating factors for me. I spent money on a relatively powerful computer, which has higher specs than what is recommended for the game, yet I still find that frame rate dropping, sometimes as low as 30-35. Another port from Ubisoft which little effort has gone into.\nThere are many more points that I would like to make as to why I don't recommend, I could write to no end about the faults, but unfortunately this review must end.", "hours": 21.3, "username": "Maegon", "products": 115, "early_access": false}

I'm dreading playing through this game just so I can find out what happens with Desmond. :(\nSo far this Kenway hack of an Assassin is simply infuriatingly frustrating. With the first four games you could at least get used to the little quirks when jumping around and even use them to your advantage. With Kenway he acts like he's the bomb but he is merely a shadow of what his forebearers were.\nGun mechanics are awkward, messages constantly pop up on the screen all at once not giving you time to read them and understand what to do all while trying to listen to the dialog and watch what's happening on the screen. It's like I'm watching some kind of interactive movie that I'm really interested in but I keep getting interrupted by having to play the game.\nLike other reveiwers have said, it feels like a series of challenges that expect you to be a pro at playing the game from the start and then shows you how inferior of a gamer you are when you fail at acheiving 100% sync. At least in the other games I didn't feel guilty for not getting 100% on everything and could move on to the next game with a tear in my eye.\nIf you want to know what happens next in the story line it's worth buying and struggling through which I will continue to begrudgingly do. But if you have no emotional connection to the series then don't waste your time and perhaps just watch the cut scene movies on youtube.\nOh, and on the plus side they did make me feel immersed in the environment so far. I just wish there was more to do. Where are all the shops? Where are all the properties? It didn't make sense in the last games that Ezio could buy the Hagia Sophia or the Coloseum why can't I purchase Old Northside Church or the Liberty Tree? There are so many things that they could have expanded on in this game to make it feel more like an Assassin's Creed sequel but they seem to have dropped the ball.\nI hope it gets better as I go on. I stopped playing just now because I'm having trouble listening to George Washington complain about something while disarming cannons and NOT killing any guards AND not being detected. UGH! Really? Can you make the game any more needlessly tedious and difficult? Desync'd about 15 times now! Guard saw you! Raised too much attention! Restarting you from the beginning like NES Super Mario Bros.

The game does get significantly better but still a frustration fiasco. I seem to be getting bombarded by guards everytime Connor passes gas. It wouldn't be so bad but there are SOOOOOO MANY! I have to fight off an army just to get away! LITERALLY! To the point where it feels like a game bug. :( There are a lot of other areas that make me feel like this game is simply unfinished. Dialog's overlapping, cut scenes cut short in the middle of plot dialogue. They don't make clear what you're doing in the game to actually make you care. I didn't realize I was recruiting people until all of a sudden I somehow was able to send people on missions. I still haven't figured out this crafting stuff.\nBottom line is that this game had GREAT potential to be an AMAZING game in the franchise and it's like the team just GAVE UP and pushed it out the door. Perhaps they were excited to move on to Black Flag? I don't know. I just wish the team had put more of their heart into it. It feels seriously lacking in finished product love.

After the first few missions in the game youll be like \"Okay when does the story actually start?\" A lot of people who are fans of the franchise hated how long the story took to take off in AC3, but I thoroughly enjoyed playing as Haytham Kenway. He is  a very precise character about his actions. He doesnt second guess himself and his mission and is very dynamic when it comes to his and Connors relationship later on in the game. For me, it was a treat to finally see father and son working together even though their paths may vary. And fans also seem to hate Connor. Why? He is probably the most straight forward, blunt, honest, and brutal assassin yet. I can see that the writers wanted a certain emotional pull with Connor. Considering you play as Haytham and how you meet Connors mother before Connor was born, and then play as Connor and how he is molded and shaped by his mothers death, and other events. which he watched before his eyes as a child. And his character developement is there. Who is my father? Why do these men want to take my peoples land? Of course, this wouldnt be an assassins creed game without the weird Scifi alien people that came before our civilization. I honestly hate that part of these games. I hate the animus, and I hate Desmond. Ever since the original AC I couldt get behind the whole matrix like feel to the animus. Can we just have the fictional part of the assassins and templar battle along side the historical scenery and gameplay? Why do they feel the need to tie in a Scifi part thats lost its depth and seems to be constant bull? Thats just my opinion over those sections. There are times in game where you play as Desmond. Which isnt new if youve played previous titles. But god do I hate them. I hate the supporting characters as well. They are bland and annoying and cliche and always will be.

No amount of detail and historically acurate architecture can keep me hooked when a game called ASSASSIN'S Creed would only let me kill 2 named characters in the first HOUR AND A HALF!\nOther notes against this game:\n- No gamepad support, only keyboard controls.\n- Limited Graphics settings, no HD, no windowed mode.\nIf you love really long movies about random pseudo-accurate Ben Franklin and the Revolutionary War, this product if for you,\nIf you are looking for an actual game that builds atmosphere and connection, this is not for you.\n1/10", "hours": 2.6, "user_id": "76561198026986524", "username": "Ben Grimm", "products": 322, "early_access": false}

The place this game's combat shines is using the special tools at your disposal to lay traps or ambush enemy soldiers like an assassin.\nThe assassin's creed franchise is known for it's free running, it's a core part of every single game and this game took a lot of steps to improve it and even change some aspects but overall it's still the same old issue of \"no i didn't say jump on that!\". Despite that it's still satisfying to run along roof tops stabbing red coats which is good because the way the map works. In previous assassin's creed games you'd go to a certain area and reveal a large chunk of the map, in this that still happens but you can't get all the map that way you need to run along certain areas to cut through the fog which is deeply aggrivating.\nThe story of assassin's creed 3 really shines out through the entire franchise, in past games it's was a simple story line that didn't really attach you to the character much without going through 3 games in ezio's case. In assassin's creed 3 the main character goes through several mistakes, victories and loses on his quest to save his people that by the end you find it hard not to feel sad for him, it really is the best part of the game.\nAs a tripple A title lots of things slip through the cracks and the game is left unoptimized as hell but this one still does a lot of things well, i give it an 8/10, if you're a fan of the series this is not a game to skip.", "hours": 80.2, "username": "Doc Monday", "products": 453, "early_access": false}

I have played through all the previous game, and a chunk of Black Flag, but while many people seem to think      it fine tuned the rough edges of III, I'm not sure. The killmoves are much more intense with Connor rolling under attacks,disarming enemies (even when not using fists) and finishing with brutal blows in the no threatback or face. The tomahawk, while not being a traditional assassin weapon, is small and effective and suits Connor well, as does the replacer of the crossbow as a long range stealth weapon-the bow. The crafting can be complex, but the homestead missions cover a nice story aside from the vicious mission of revenge. The naval missions are not as immersive as Black Flag, as you cannot simply jump in your ship and go exploring, but then you're not a pirate. The hunting is perhaps easier than Black Flag, although that does make it somewhat less interesting- a bear attack has little chance to hurt you, so poses no real threat- but a leopard could single handedly kill you if you don't shoot it first in Black Flag. Overall, many new additions that compliment the game: particularly the freerunning in trees and the ability to attract enemies by whistling, though it was a shame not to be able to use it when hiding in the (new) hidespots that you can move around in.\nAnd my favourite weapon: rope darts from above!", "hours": 166.6, "user_id": "76561198097199288", "username": "harry", "products": 43, "early_access": false}

If you are a die-hard Assassin's creed fan as i am then you will enjoy this game. It has a great story an even better gameplay. They added to the fight mechanics that made it alot smoother and even the parkour was revamped.\nThe story was good. I loved it. It kept you on your toes while still staying true to the history of the events in the Assassin's Creed style we know and love. I definately learned a thing or two about American history and I found it very interesting. The story actually follows the Assassin's rather than say a pirate that touches slighly on the Assassin's and only half way through the game. The twists and turns that the story adds make it quite enjoyable as, even though the story can get a tad predictable, you are never completely certain of the comming events. If you are looking for a game that doesn't end as soon as you press play then this is a good one being slightly on the longer side. I have finnished the game and have 31 hours of gameplay time. I did however take my time with the game and I recommend you do too. If you love history then you probably love Assassin's Creed and if you love Assassin's Creed then this is a must play.\nThe movement and fighting mechanics have been improved since previous games. For one you can now vault over obsticles rather that having to climb on it and jump off it. Also when being persued by angry red coats you can evade them by running through buildings. This adds and exciting element. It is borderline Hollywood effects but the game can pull it off. Then there is the tree climbing. Never before have we seen this an an Assassin's game and it just makes things fit perfectly. It aids the story along and helps give the charaters a more immersed feel. The combat has also been revamped with the addition of double takedowns and human shields. This make the game fun to play and leaves you awe struck when you pull off your first double takedown and it doesn't lose it touch. Time and time again I found myself purposely just blocking attacks and waiting for the chance to pull off one of these deadly manuvers. The human shield was added, I presume, to combat the newly added guns man. Though guns have been seen before we have never seen them on this level. When 4 gunmen line up to fire you have no chance of running nor can you attack then all before being shot so the use of human shields is almost mandatory. Overall i love the new mechanics.\nThe naval combat in this game i feel is the best I have seen. I prefer it to the naval base game of Assassin's creed 4 and though not as exciting and in depth the simplicity make for an all round better expirience. I found myself wanting to keep getting naval contracts and when I finally completed then all I couldn't help but feel dissapointed.\nThe game however is not the best of the series and so i would not recommend it as a first time Assassin's game. Rather go for 2 or brotherhood. The game does have a few down sides. The voice acting leaves alot to be disired to be honest. The majority of the characters have pretty good voice acting but Connor unfortutely sound very monotone and boring to listen too. His voice just lacks that depth that make dialogue all the more interesting to listen too.\nFurther the upgrade system, though there, is not really needed. I played the entire game without buying a new sword or gun. In previous game the upgrade played an intergral role as enemies got stronger and increased in number and so better armour was needed and better weapons needed to fend off the stronger attacks from bigger enemies. I would have loved to see an upgrade system that you want to use. This however is by no means a gamebreaker and doesn't take away from the story one bit.\nAnd thus I get to the end of this review. If you have made it this far I applaud you I truely do. This wall 'o text is by no mean quick to read. I hope that this has helped those that are on the fence about buying the game. I was for a while and have never regretted getting it. Is it worth paying full price. I thinks thats up to you to decide. I bought in on sale and so I feel it is well worth what i paid for it. I know that this game went above and far beyond my expectatations for it.", "hours": 31.2, "user_id": "76561198026658583", "username": "Keyboard Warrior", "products": 111, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

One is templar and one is an Assassin. So at least you aren't playing a goodie two shoes the whole time, but for whatever reason this game is more about the boats. You will play the game in order to unlock those segments of gameplay.\nInstead of a commerce empire in each city, in this you build a cult around your homestead and those who reside there believe in you somewhat fanatically. Particularly when you will kill a dozen or so men in order regain the blueprints for the folding chair. I mean, wow, it's the folding chair.\nWell, I guess these things need to be done if you are to save the earth from the Sun.\nThere is DLC here where you see a Crazed King Washington, but it was too buggy to complete so I gave up.\nOverall: Not as good as Brotherhood, the overhaul in combat is welcome, but the fact that when-ever I want to run fast I have to put up with the fact that I will want to climb on crates and fences instead of skirt around the sides of them still has not been solved (Hint Ubisoft: If I'm pushing all the way forward make me run fast, when I hit the right trigger, change the animation to more of a hunch, leave the speed the same.  This will give me the ability to gladly opt into the insanity of free-running over milk crates etc when I choose to.). The ship sequences are awesome.\nTIP: During the finale, throw some food into the oven or microwave, because after you chase the final boss the rest of it is pretty much a cutscene.. and believe it or not a non-skippable set of credits..

It is hard for me to give this a thumbs down. If you haven't played the series, go from the start; if you have, like me you'll probably play this game regardless of the bad reviews.\nSadly, it feels that with every new AC game, a little bit more of what made it great seems to slip away to be replaced by something unnecessary and unwanted. I just sat through the longest unskippable credits roll in history (ironic that you get an achievement called 'no good deed goes unpunished' just afterwards), which gave me some time to ponder this game and its myriad faults, some of which seem pretty unforgivable given the unbelievably vast number of people and presumably money involved in this game's creation.\n* Awful port to PC. It's just so lazy. Why can't I just have a key I can press to whistle for my horse, another to throw a smoke bomb, another to shoot an arrow etc? At least let me bind them all to 1-0 on my keyboard for quick access. Why force me to hold down R then select it from a wheel? Why make the click-press-click-click-press chore of sending my brethren off on missions so tedious? Why force me to navigate console controller-tailored submenu after submenu to craft when it could all be laid out nicely and me be able to quickly click with my mouse? The list of poor UI grievances goes on and on, making almost every moment spent in the game less appealing than they should. A good UI is one you don't notice, that blends seamlessly with the feel of the game. This is the opposite of that.\n* Speaking of the crafting system, it's a hideous abomination. By the time you just about get to grips with it, the game is over and you're left scratching your head as to what the point was. Spoiler alert: there isn't one.\n* Boring, bland environments compared to previous games. Wooden colonial buildings vs the majesty of Florence or Rome? I know which I found more compelling.\n* Why do they have to change all the keys between each AC game? It's very frustrating if you've just played Revelations and move to this... you basically have to relearn everything.\n* Lazy stuff that breaks immersion, like in every cutscene Connor's outfit reverts to the one you start with, irrespective of him wearing a totally different outfit only seconds before and after. Did none of the 10000 playtesters notice this? If they did, why wasn't it fixed? Just one of many glaring bugs/errors/things Ubisoft couldn't be arsed to sort out.\n* The hunting part felt like a massive steal from Red Dead Redemption, a game I really loved. The problem is it just doesn't capture your attention like that game does; I barely bothered with hunting here because it just wasn't immersive and effortlessly enjoyable like RDR's hunting.\n* Maybe it's just me, but I died so many times jumping off synchronisation points... in previous games it was always obvious which way you had to dive to hit a haystack or whatever. Here, you are sometimes up in a tree with leaves totally obscuring the ground so you just choose a direction, perform a leap of faith and... oh, well. Sorry about your legs, Connor.\n* Ezio was always a real ladies' man, so it was obvious how he could be an ancestor of Desmond. Connor never strikes up any romantic relationships at all, doesn't even take an interest in doing so. I suppose at the end we're meant to feel like he still has a lot of living to do, but it felt like a bit of a loose end, considering he's only the protagonist for this one game.\nThere were a few things I liked I guess. Firstly I'd urge everyone to play through the homestead missions, if only because it really adds to the plot and some important stuff is left unanswered if you don't.The combat is still clunky but the combat animations were really cool at times. I don't get the hate on Connor, he wasn't on the level of Ezio but was still likeable enough. I enjoyed the plot twist at the end of the (oh-so-long) tutorial phase. My favourite name in the endless credits was a guy called Stone Chin. Chin Wee Lee was a close second. Awesome. Hmm... that's about it really.\n6/10, must try harder Ubisoft.

But as the Desmond's story it's like a downside, because for me the story about the 1st civilization is quite absurd. And this ACIII character isn't as strong as it's predecessor, so it doesn't leave a strong impact for the player as Altair or Ezio.\nAside from the story, the game itself presenting a new game mechanic. I think it's somewhat good, the battle is become more fluctuative than the previous game, the way you kill the enemy is becoming more realistic as well.\nBut the point that you must taken from the previous game is you don't have to press space to free running, so you should get yourself customized in the way the game played, bcs for the prev game you have to press space. And now pressing space is kinda useless.\nThe game mechanic for obtaining money is different as well. In this game you play as Raton'haketon (Connor) who got the vision from the 1st civ to join the brotherhood, as the brotherhood is starting to wither in America. So you settle in some land and can invite new homestead to join in your land. As time goes by, every homestead serve many item that you can trade or create from receipt.\nSo the way to obtaining the money is to TRADE.\nYou can also hunt, because Connor is a native Indian, so you can hunt wild animal to collect for it's meat, fur, etc.\nThere is also side quest for sailing and battle on water, it's quite fun actually, as it's a start for AC IV. Other side quest is rather boring, because you just have to kill this-that, infiltrate, and deliver. The good side quest in this game is homestead mission, as it have a story on it's own, ship quest as it's fun, and the liberation.\nWell, as a fan of the AC franchise I would recommend this to anyone that like the AC series. As for other people who want to play AC, maybe you should play the previous version, bcs the story is really continuation from the previous.", "hours": 59.8, "username": "Venterivia", "products": 446, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

This game was very unique and paved the way for Black Flag, Freedom Cry, and Rogue (which are essentially all the same game).

The combat in this was very simplified compared to the previous Assassin's Creed games but brutal and not to mention quite badass.

While I tremendously enjoyed the second series including Brotherhood and Revelations, I decided to give the third one a go regardless of those negative reviews.\nAfter thirty hours of playtime and completing the story, I can say I love this game as much as I love the previous ones.\nHowever, there's a very clear line between things I like and I don't like about this game, soI think it is better to categorize them into different sections.\nI LIKED:\n- Beautiful graphics and magnificent environments.\n- Smooth and fast motions in combats.\n- Great background music\n- Fun naval combats. I hugely enjoyed these naval combats and wished there were more of them.\n- Homestead missions. I loved homestead missions and enjoyed watching the community grow. It gave me similar enjoyment from watching Esperanca grow back in Assassin's creed 2. (I genuinely enjoyed the missions too. I couldn't stop smiling when Norris ran into Connor, shouting with joy, \"She said yes!\")\n- The characters. Very dynamic characters with superb voice acting. Storyline is a weak point but these characters make the storyline much more interesting than it really is.\n- Historicals. I personally think that this one delivers the most detailed portraits of the in-game era so far in the series.\nI DISLIKED:\n- I'm gonna be straight up. I didn't like the ending.\nHonestly, I don't know what the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 was it. I see at the time they were trying to leave questions and wonders for the upcoming series, but it was completely out of nowhere. Probably the weakest ending I've seen in the series.\n- Controls.\nThey made some changes regarding the controls but I'm pretty sure for those of you who enjoyed playing assassin's creed 2, you wouldn't like this new control. The way you counter is changed and has become more difficult to endeavour. Also, with the new control, you can't prevent yourself from climbing everywhere while you are running. So, you'd have to walk if you don't wanna end up climbing everywhere.\n- Inconsistent missions. There are few non-animus missions happening in various places. The very existence of these missions is questionable and put unwated pauses when you are playing.\n- Slow beginning. Takes about 5 hours of gameplay to actually become an assassin.\n- Some new changes like trading and crafting, but they lack initiatives both fun-wise and need-wise.\nYou see how the thing I didn't like are quite detailed compared to the things I like. If you look at some of the details they newly implemented, you might start complaining about the game.

I cannot fathom any good idea as to why they created the controls like they did, other than to simply do it \"differently\" from all other games of similar genre.  Going with a standard control scheme like similar games would have greatly improved this area; but no, the default key-mapping and functionality is horrid...cannot stand it, and it absolutely takes away from the combat and overall experience.  I don't know this for fact, but I assume this problem is b/c they ported the game from console, and the keyboard + mouse input does not mesh well??

I enjoy playing them, enjoy watching them being played and even enjoy reading about them, but to write a review myself?\nNaaah.\nAnd yet here I am, punching in one word after the other with one purpose - to warn you.\nBefore we start, let me underline the fact that I really liked the game. As usual there is a whole lot to do, the combat system was a wee bit refreshed (finally), the environments look more lively and realistic, the time period is really interesting (and no, I\u2019m not an American), the assassin recruits finally have their own personas and at last, but not at least, naval battles. Glorious naval battles with their splendor, brutality and finesse. Aye, it\u2019s a pirate\u2019s life for me! The ship sections in AC3 are actually enough of a reason for me to buy Black Flag. But we\u2019re veering a little off-course.\nIs Assassin\u2019s Creed III a good game? I think yes \u2013 for the current low, low price. But I really pity those who had to buy it for the full charge. Why?\nBugs.\nAs it stands today, almost every Assassin\u2019s Creed was plagued by a number of bugs and glitches, most of them were promptly removed after the release, though. Not AC3 \u2013 this one is still haunted by some atrocious bugs which will make you pull your hair out in clumps. Some of the glitches are just annoying, at least one of them is actually game-breaking.\nLet's start with the small stuff and proceed to the large glitches, shall we?\n1. You know the words of the creed that bind assassin's into the brotherhood? \u201cNothing is true, everything is permitted?\u201d Yeah, if this game is to be taken as canon, the creed should go more like this: nothing is true, everything is permitted as long as you do the things OUR way. Example: you are tasked with clearing out a deck of a frigate, crawling with redcoats. You swim to its broadside, you carefully climb aboard, you plan your attack and attempt to flawlessly execute it. Only after the first step (which the developers have actually taken into account) you suddenly get discovered by two guards who had their back turned on you. No line of sight whatsoever, no way for them to hear you. You naturally try again, this time by climbing the ropes, but the moment you even touch them the whole deck turns towards you and attempts to make you come down. With the use of excessive force. Once again \u2013 no line of sight, no sound made. So why does that happen? Apparently because 'screw you, that's why!'\nThis is just one example, and there are dozens like this one. Most of the missions are scripted so heavily, that they could actually be turned into a play. For a game that proclaims freedom with every drawn breath, it sure likes to guide us by the hand, 'or else!'.\n2. And don't get me started on the additional objectives. Imagine that: you are tasked with chasing down a guy who can potentially leak  a valuable piece of your plan straight to your target. What's the most effective course of action? Well, that largely depends on the situation, but I'm quite sure that it's not climbing onto a flight of stairs and tackling the guy from the air \u2013 just for the hell of it. But that\u2019s what actually has to happen in order for you to get this god-forsaken 100% synch. After a couple of sections like this you really start to question Connor\u2019s sanity. The next part actually makes you question his agility as well.\n3. Smaller movement glitches and AI bugs have become somewhat of a staple of the franchise. It's only natural they make their return here. Nothing major, really, until one of the climbing glitches throws you down a 5 story building. Are we to believe that Connor just slipped? Well, that would be an embarrassing way to die \u2013 especially for an assassin.\n4. But all of the above were just small fires. Ladies and gents \u2013 here come the big guns. Let's start with convoy glitch, as it is somewhat the least serious of the group.\nAt some point in the game you will gain access to a caravan which will be able to transport goods from your homestead to the nearest city in order to turn them into a profit. Of course since the frontier is not yet guarded and regulated (or rather it is - by the enemy) the caravans will get attacked from time to time. The only thing to do then is to rush to them and defend the goods by slaughtering some puny redcoats. Or at least I think that's how it goes as after the first attack - which I didn't manage to rebuke - one of my caravans got stuck in the attacked state. For all eternity. Losing 1/3 of the income might not be so bad, but the worst part is that I never got to defend any other caravan - the game just can't script any attack afterwards. Maybe I should be happy, who knows?\n5. UFO mission for the Frontiersmen. This one I was lucky enough to avoid, but boy, oh boy were those poor chaps that got affected by this crap\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 And with good reason - as it appears one of the side missions might get bugged out which makes it impossible to be finished. \"Oh, we're sorry\" said Ubisoft. \"Did you want to have that 100% completion rate? What. A. Shame. Wanna start the game from the scratch? No? Also a shame \u2013 cause guess what, you have to! Muhuhahahaha!\"\n6. And at last, but not at least - a bug from the Tyranny of King Washington DLC. Before you say anything - I know that the DLCs have their own sections on Steam, but judging from what the Deluxe version of AC3 costs now, I might as well describe the issue here - we all know that whoever has not bought the game yet is going for the full version anyway.\nAlright, let's get on with this. Look at the last couple of sentences of the previous section. The ones about 100% completion rate and having to begin the game anew. Imagine that you are faced with a similar situation, but this time instead of the mentioned 100% synch, it's the last mission that's being dangled on the string right in front of you. You know you want it. It's the last mission! You've earned it!\nWell too bad, mister! Due to a certain bug in Episode 1 of Tyranny, you'll have to earn the right to play the last mission once more. From the scratch.\nClassy, right?\nBut let's not end here.\n7. It's 2015 already, right? That would place the premiere of the base game roughly two years ago and the premiere of the DLCs about a year ago. \"A lot of time, especially to patch up such jarring mistakes\" one could think. And once again one would be wrong. No patches for any of these features, my friends! It appears that any support for AC3 was scrapped right after Black Flag has hit the shelves. And I'm going to make a wild guess that the same has recently happened to the support of Black Flag itself, with Unity being released.\n\u2026 This is just wrong.\nIt's a typical: \"we've got your bucks, now buzz off\" mentality that seems to grow more and more rampant with every single year. And you know what? I've finished the story of Desmond (sad and often disappointing as it was) and I'm going to play Black Flag because of its positive reviews and naval combat (DAMN, I LOVE NAVAL COMBAT IN AC3!), but after that me and Ubisoft are through.\nI'm not going to tell you to do the same. You be your own judges.\nAfter all, nothing is true.\nEverything is permitted.", "hours": 81.4, "user_id": "76561198119680399", "username": "Gregnoth", "products": 236, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "208480", "page": 234, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-01-29", "text": "serves as a stealth-action game with ample content that is equitable to its predecessors overall, though it is severely detracted by disappointing developments, a noticeably glitchy interface and failed attempts at innovation in the series.\nfollows Connor, a Native American in the Assassin lineage, as he struggles to repel the Templars while taking part in event that shaped the American Revolution. The freerunning, combat sequences and progress through history are just as satisfying as ever. Loads of costumes, weapons (both purchasable and craftable) and abilities serve to add depth and customization to the gameplay, making Connor feel like the player's own creation. Numerous sidequests lengthen and support the game while allowing the player to explore the game's world through different avenues that retain a feeling of freshness by not grinding through them. Historical information to be divulged through seeing people and places incentivizes exploration, though the historical facts are sometimes hard to differentiate from the game's fiction, which makes the education value of the game questionable. Additionally, certain post-completion rewards allow the player to truly take command of the game, serving as satisfying means to engage the game in while the player strives for full completion.\nThis game does, however, faces difficulties. The biggest flaw that this game repeats consistently are its lackluster payoffs.\nis rife with missed opportunities and dead ends that will leave the player at best confused and at worst outraged. Its main story faces this issue in two major ways. First, Connor's saga, though decently paced through most of the game, screeches to a halt by the end of the game. The two top villains, who were built up so thoroughly during the rest of the game, have final encounters with Connor that can best be described as a quicktime event and a cutscene. Such needless handicaps and disconnects from player interaction are massive letdowns that leave the tribulations gone through by playing the rest of the story not feel worthwhile. The second issue comes in Desmond's storyline. Throughout the game, the player will be brought to the real world to engage as Desmond, who plays just like Connor but without all of his weapons and upgrades, thus feeling very weak. Desmond's missions are enjoyable as a view into what modern-day Assassining is like, but are ultimately letdowns. They feel wholly out-of-place, and the underlying story will be incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't played the prior games, thus leaving new players even more disjoint from the game. These shorts will force the player to call into question the value of completing the game's additional content, not knowing whether there will be an eventual payoff there, either.\nThe game also strives to stand out in the series by taking bold steps in key areas, with varying results. In some cases, the game succeeds. The diversity brought about for the protagonist, for instance, adds valuable style and culture to the game. Connor's Native American heritage is largely treated with respect, and the game provides players with opportunities to learn more about Native Americans in ways that don't even enter into the gameplay. However, many of the changes this game underwent were for the worse. The change in setting from Italy to colonial America does provide some freshness to the franchise; however, it sacrifices playability to achieve this. Freerunning in the city rooftops is largely useless now as guards will immediately investigate you when spotted - which is often. Freerunning in the forests is conceptually interesting but plays poorly, as there are few entry points to climb into the treetops, and even when in the treetops the players are mainly stuck on linear paths to a predetermined end, with few branching paths involved. But perhaps the most significant change is one of the least gameplay-changing: the protagonist himself. All the diversity that surrounds his character cannot save Connor from being as bland and dull as he is. His voice only shifts out of a lame monotone to go to grumbly anger. He shows more emotion while pig farming than during a pivotal death sequence. He never seems to grow over his adventures (except to become more grumbly), and even the end of what one may call his 'character arc' comes off as forced and clich\u00e9d. Connor's rigidness as a character just serves as one more disappointment to the player. Unfortunately, some series-staple bugs, such as dying via fall from the plane of existence, glitchy jump sequences, spawns into impossible locations and even hard crashes were not changed from previous games, and remain consistently present in this title.\nThis game reached far, and consequently fell hard. It did not fail from the fall, though, because it always has its satisfying core mechanics as an\ngame to lie back on. What hurts most about this game, though, is that it clearly had the potential to be what it wanted to be. Should just some more time have gone into developing Connor, the interactions with the new area layouts and the rewards for beating various parts of the game, and this title could have been a masterpiece of not just the series, but the stealth-action genre. Instead, what it serves as now is an about-average game that should please fans of American history, Native Americans or the\nlore, but most others should look elsewhere for their Assassin simulator.\ngets a C.", "hours": 44.6, "username": "phantom2450", "products": 684, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Very, very fun fighting indeed.\n+ Unlike previous Asasssin's Creed games, number 3 has a balanced economy, meaning you don't become insanely rich mid-game. In fact, even after looting all chests in the game, you're not going to have enough pounds to purchase all ship upgrades (not that they're essential), outfits and the most expensive weapons. I thought this was a flaw of previous titles in the series, where I invested in businesses and just became incredibly wealthy that everything became too easy. That problem is solved.\n- So, rewards for some collectibles are good, as I already mentioned. But rewards for others are poor and don't offer much incentive to go about collecting in the first place. The only reason you'd consider doing so is if you're a completionist. For instance, collecting all feathers gives you ONE new outfit (big deal) which doesn't really do anything. Collecting the almanac pages provides access to inventions which can decorate your home, again who cares.\n- Some side quests like hunting animals and helping individuals re-settle on the homestead don't offer much in terms of gameplay rewards and aren't particularly exciting, they can get boring unless you only do them here and there, inbetween other activities.\n- Ubisoft just don't get how truly DISGUSTING their controls are for the Assassin's Creed franchise on PC. Yes it's playable and yes you get used to it, to the point it becomes second nature. But that doesn't change the fact that the controls for PC are simply bad. They are BAD. It takes more than an hour to get used to (I dare say several), the opening tutorial is laughable at explaining the combat mechanics. I mean, you can't even bind the keys you want half the time (enter can't be bound). There's excessive keys (maybe like 10-12) for combat that could be achieved in 3-4. If ONLY Ubisoft weren't lazy as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and could be bothered to make a proper control system when they port the game from console. If only.\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\nAssassin's Creed 3 is an epic game. I really did enjoy my time on this and can't see any valid reason as to why it's a bad game. Better than any of the games before it, it's a must play. I do recommend it, despite the awkward controls, as you will get used to it with time.", "hours": 54.1, "username": "Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin", "products": 107, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 238, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-01-17", "text": "For a while there I thought I would never recommend this. I have never played a more thoroughly unpolished, broken, and unfinished game than Assassin's Creed III.\nYet here I am recommending it to the 3 people who haven't already tried it, and I have to sort of figure out why. During the 60 hours or so of 100% completing every objective in the game, I found myself hugely ambivalent - completely floored at times by its scope, ambition, and amazing atmosphere, while at other times insanely bored at the mundane side quests or frustrated by its linear objectives and poorly scripted sequences.\nAssassin's Creed III gets so much stuff wrong, so I need to start with what it gets right, partly to remind myself why I enjoyed it overall.\nThe storyline and characters, while not for everyone, really satisfied me. A father-son relationship blooming on opposite sides of a conflict, a central character who is so standoffish and serious that he becomes endearing, and the whole Desmond metastory are all strong positives. There are Desmond haters out there, I know, but while the typical end-of-the-world scenario is ho hum, the fact that you get to explore really interesting present-time locations to break up the action in the past is icing on an already very, very large cake.\nThe slow development of the main plot is also a good thing. I don't like when game designers, for fear of players being so easy to bore these days, jump right into the action and don't let off the throttle til the credits roll. This reminds me a bit of Red Dead Redemption - deliberately paced to ease you into the world and properly introduce the characters to create scope, grandeur, and meaning in the game's much more dramatic final confrontations.\nThe Homestead, your place of residence, is a colonial utopia. While the missions you run for your friends and residents reek of that typical open-world desperation wherein developers feel the need to cram some nonsensical drama into every corner of your map, the actual place (once the missions are complete) feels alive and warm in a way most video game environments fail to achieve. As you walk down the main road, which is cut through the forest and gradually develops as you progress in the story, you will see the doctor aiding a resident with breathing problems, or one of your buddies fishing on the bridge, a barmaid squishing berries with her feet for wine, or a woodworker putting the finishing touches on his freshly-made chair. It all seems trivial and scripted, and it is, but the residents all casually flow from one activity to the next on a randomized schedule, and adhere to the day-night cycle as well. They will talk to you as you pass and make you feel like a part of their world. There is an achievement tied to observing them, and I found myself really enjoying my time there, relaxing as a part of the community, if you will. And even having done that for probably longer than most people will bother, I still didn't observe a good chunk of the activities the residents partake in. It's a really nice step forward for the open-world genre, wherein most other games NPCs are either doing one specific activity forever and ever or just walking around randomly.\nSo it follows to say that Creed III's atmosphere is top-notch, especially in the frontier, which is a giant map of hills, forest, rivers, and settlements where you can run around the treetops and hunt animals and so forth. It will rain, it will snow, and it will offer jaw-dropping vistas on a very regular basis. It's a superb location and was very lovingly crafted by the map designers. The city sections in the game are more typical for the AC series and aren't as vibrant, full, or interesting as previous entries. But the frontier, along with the open waters and side maps from the Caribbean to the Great North, keep the whole very interesting.\nMissions are hit-and-miss, with some just a matter of literally getting to the icon on the map and pressing a single button. There are a lot of annoying filler quests, and the fact that so many of these seem rushed, buggy, and incomplete make me wonder if the game would have been better off reducing the quantity and focusing on the quality. My guess is yes, because some of the sequences are superb and very worthy of its bazillion dollar budget.\nAlso, the sailing is awesome.\nOne of my biggest complaints with the AC series up to this point, and I've played them all, was a lack of stuff to do, a problem particularly flagrant in the first two installments. It's hard to complain about Creed III in this sense since it is packed to the brim with systems and icons and checklists. Unfortunately, it's overwhelming and poorly explained throughout, which made my first 20 hours with the game sort of resentful at all the things I didn't want to do while the game seemed to nudge me to do them anyway. I also had this strange feeling of being shepherded through the first half of the game's story, in which I would be shown each system one at a time and without proper or meaningful context. I didn't get a sense of the open world for a long while, nor did I have any reason to tinker and toy with the new systems.\nThis is one of Assassin's Creed III's biggest flaws: there are too many poorly-designed and\nsuperfluous systems that are not properly introduced to the player. The economy system is the worst: horrible and confusing menu systems that govern collecting materials, crafting new materials, and sending those materials on convoys for money. It seems like a good idea on paper, but one that was ultimately unfinished and inexplicably uncut from the release. Just the simple idea of including a quantity selector for an item you want to send on a convoy, for example, seems to have been neglected entirely, forcing you through an arduous process for every individual piece of loot you want to sell, rendering the whole activity pointless for the tiny amount of money you will make with most items. The poorly organized menus touch pretty much the entire game in some way, from the confusing objective menus to the general stores and weapons to the hard-to-interpret world map to the fast travel system and on and on and on, and these flaws are apparent immediately.\nHunting is another poorly implemented system - you get several tools such as bait, snares, and arrows to hunt with, where all you really need is your hidden blade since most animals are too dumb to run away or get stuck in trees as you chase them. Your horse is also an animal, and it also gets stuck on trees. And bushes, and rocks, and also pebbles, and anything that has volume, making traversing the frontier a frustrating chore.\nSince the frontier itself is so vast compared to your movement speed, you will find a very considerable amount of your play time will be just getting from point A to point B in the fastest way possible, and even the improved climbing mechanics still don't make this process any less annoying than previous games. It's actually quite worse now, since the distances are much longer and there's just more empty space than before. The fast travel points are too few, and having to spend two or three minutes running just to go collect a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing feather drove me bananas.\nAnd the game is so, so buggy. Immersion-breaking, head-shaking, existential-crisis-why-do-I-play-video-games type bugs. I've never played Skyrim, I dunno. I got attacked and mauled by a wolf during a cutscene where I was just chatting with a farmer, forcing a restart, which might have been the only time I laughed out loud and enjoyed a glitch, whereas the rest are just embarassing. I get that open-world games are more prone to this type of stuff, but I would love to see Ubisoft exercise more quality control in this regard instead of kicking these games out the door every holiday season.\nAssassin's Creed III is very flawed, very frustrating, and probably still worth playing.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 238, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-01-17", "text": "This is probably the worst game in the series so far.  It's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's mediocre.  Alright, with all my ranting out of the way, let's get onto my actual opinion of the game.\nCharacters:\nOne of the reasons that made Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood so good was Ezio.  He was a young, relatable, ladykiller (and sometimes a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, but in a good way) that get's into a lot of trouble and that's why we loved him.  While, Connor on the other hand seems to be the exact opposite.  He seems to have no emotions.  Whenever he talks, he talks in this monotone voice that feels like he doesn't really care what he's talking about.  Achilles on the other hand, is a well-developed mentor style character that was an Assassin long ago, but now spends his older years in his house and teaches Connor how to be a true assassin.  The villian is actually pretty well thought out because you start out by thinking one person is the villian, but then it turns out he's pretty much an anti-hero and someone else is the true villain.  (Sorry for the lack of specificity, but that's for the story section of my review)\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are okay I guess.  Nothing mind-boggling for its time, just standard 2012 looking graphics.\nMusic:\nThe music seems to be not there.  Like not at all.  The chase theme from the original Assassin's creed was really good and made escaping from a large conflict seem as badass as possible.  Maybe it's because it's so good, that I don't notice it because it fits the theme so well, I don't really know.\nStory:\nYou start out by playing as an Assassin looking character going around killing people, climbing buildings, and doing other Assassin-like things.  But then about 30 minutes in, you find out that you were playing as the villain.  I really liked this, because it introduced the villain in a unique way that I've never seen done before.  (Braid doesn't count, because you find out at the end).  After learning that, you cut to Connor playing with his friends and then they get attacked by colonists.  After that, it's the stereotypical Americans rebelling against the British with the occasional Americans being large \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s to Native Americans.  (I'm American, so I can sat that).\nGameplay:\nIt's Assassin's Creed, we all know what it is.  Or do we?  Is it really Assassin's Creed anymore or is it Dynasty Warriors?  There seems to be an endless supply of guards when they chase you and it's annoying to go back to incognito.  Also, the ship sections of this game downright suck.  There the worst part of the game by far.  You constantly have to change sails for pretty much no reason at all.  The wind seems to have no purpose while sailing except forcing you to have to change sails every 15 seconds.  Also, if you get into a naval battle, you can kiss goodbye to your sanity.  You have to move your ship so you're exactly lined up with the enemy while the wind is obviously going against you, and hope to god that you hit while you're taking so much damage.  If this is how Assassin's Creed III does ship battles, I don't even want to see what Assassin's Creed IV is like.\nPresentation\nThe health bar, or should I say collumn, is not a good design choice.  In all the previous Assassin's Creed games, your\nhealth was measured by multiple boxes (rectangles, whatever).  That was good because you knew exactly how much health you had and how much more hits you could take until you went down.  Remember how in the previous games, you would start out with very little health, but then eventually get more?  That's nonexistant in this game.  You use the same health collumn your entire playthrough.  Other than that, there's nothing too serious in the presentation department.\nVerdict:\nIf you've played all the other games in the series and you want another AC game for your fix, this one will suffice.  Just don't expect your high to be as good as the other ones.  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)  If you payed $60 for this game, I'm sorry for you.  It's worth it for $30 imo.

I'd come to expect quite a lot from AC after the last trilogy, and the promise of an AC set during the American Revolution, headlined by a Native was super exciting to me. Unfortunately, AC3 delivered on almost none of those expectations.\nThe mechanics have been scaled back in many unfortunate areas. Combat has been modified to make it more \"challenging\", but really it's just not as fun. You can still kill basically anyone in one or two hits, but they force you to use certain moves against certain opponents, and as the game goes on, those opponents become more prevalent, so all your fights end up feeling the same. The new additions of some interesting weapon types also seemed promising at first, but they proved to be unintuitive to use due to the new interface, and mostly just not as effective as the old staples. The combination of the altered combat and interface made fights feel less dynamic than they did in the past where you could chain kills fluidly together and it feel badass.\nThe parkour, while being significantly streamlined, did nothing to address common frustrations such as getting stuck climbing something ridiculous like a fence post or a door, and was missing some of the features from past games (shoulder charging for instance).\nThe mini-games of improving your home and sending assassins out on contracts was replaced with a series of sidequests that appeared to do nothing for you in the long run, and an incredibly boring and clunky trading minigame where you trade random goods for other random goods. Supposedly you can manipulate the market to make some commodity worth more per trade, but it seemed pretty arbitrary, and the menus were so clunky I didn't have the patience for selecting 6 deerskins individually for each trade I wanted to make, so I gave up on it pretty quickly.\nThe main character was also painfully earnest and irritating, and the whole story felt disjointed. I never knew what was going on or why I was doing anything, and there was almost no incentive at all to completing side quests. When I finished the game I thought to myself, \"Oh, I didn't know that was the last mission...\" Never a good sign.\nThere was one thing that I spent hours doing for no other reason than it was fun. The naval combat was really well done (if feeling totally tacked on, and not well integrated to the main storyline). I really enjoyed it despite the fact that it had nothing to do with anything, and Conor would throw on a silly admiral's outfit every time you took the boat out.

Ubisoft took many risks with the game, especially with Connor, who is definitely neither an Altair or Ezio in terms of personality. Many see him as dull and lacking any character, but I saw a man who uses the creed to seek justice and revenge. I found the story nice with an interesting moral behind it.\nIt may be my favourite game but I can see why it gets a lot of hate. The intro/tutorial sequence lasting multiple hours where you play as Haytham Kenway drags on, but is necessary to set the story in motion. Story has never been Ubisoft's strong point, however, instead capitalising on the other aspects. Combat is brutal, but stealth is sadly absent, with the missions feeling very linear. Connor prefers the direct approach aside to taking assassinations slowly, which didn't bother me as much. None of the characters appear more than two-dimensional.\nEnvironments are beautiful and detailed, with new weather patterns and summer/winter seasons. Snow adds a new dimension to the world, making you want to travel by horse or tree. The frontier in iteslf is massive and ready to be explored, but there is barely anything to do.

For the most part the game has stunning visuals as my computer was able to run it on max settings, with little to no hiccups in the framerate.  Running around Boston and New York in the late 18th century was a lot of fun, especially since I am a particular fan of the American Revolution and the early history of the United States.  This was a primary reason for ignoring much the negative reviews of the game.\nTL;DR: Interesting concept to have game setting in American Revolution.  Has amazing visuals and cool naval battles.  However, a boring/repetitive battle system, spotty free running controls, too many cutscenes, and a flimsy storline detract from the game.\nPostitives:\n- As I said before, the visuals of the game are pretty amazing, even if the game is 2 years old.  the textures of the city and characters were done really well and the shadow effects really added to the astethtics of the game.\n-Haytham Kenway, the first character you get to play, has a good storyline, but was abrublty stopped short to tell the tale of Connor.\n-Beating the crap out of Redcoats was fun, especially with the Tomahawk.\n-Naval Battles were a lot of fun and were challenging. Taking down frigates and multiple smaller ships with the canons was awesome and you could truly feel the power of the firepower of the ships back in the day.\n-The Liberation and Assassination side quest's helped me passed the time when I felt like taking a break from the main mission.  Liberation consists of helping people by defeating Tax Collector's, soldiers harrassing farmers, planting false information on snitches, etc.\nNegatives:\n-Repetitive combat system.  Sure the combos were cool, but they were automatic as I mashed B, X, or A continously.  Using the counter button (B), was easy to avoid getting hit.  I did not like the fact that if you failed to finish a combo, which at times were lengthy, the enemy wouldn't die. I mean how many times do I really have to hack a soldier with a TOMAHAWK before he dies?\n-No crouch button made it very difficult to sneak around enemies or take proper cover from people shooting at you.  I was made several times by soldiers as Connor slowly walked on top of a roof trying not to be detected.  For a game of stealth, I thought it would be normal to have a crouch feature.\n-Using a soldier as a meat shield was difficutl. I could never get the timing right as a firing line got ready to shoot me.  I always ended up getting shot as I desperately tried to grab an enemy near me to use him as a shield. I ended up giving up and charging the line each time to prevent them from shooting me.\n-The story was alright. I had mixed feelings about it, but overall it was flimsy to me as to why the Assassin's were fighting the Templars.  Connor just seemed to hate the Templar's soley because of personal reasons (which I don't want to ruin for anyone on here) and simply went along with the Templar's are bad because I said so from him trainer cliche.\n-Most of the side quests don't really add any value to you. I went through the whole game without really having to upgrade or waste time hunting ( you get enough of that in the Tutorial to care after that point). I had about $11,000 at the end of the game and didn't spend a dime of it.\n-Free running was kind of a chore.  I found myself jumping on rails and fences or doing something I did not want to do while running from British soldiers all because the sprint and parkour button was the same (Right Trigger).\n-The biggest issue I have were the cutscenes. It got really frustrating walking about 3 to 5 meters cutscene, fight someone real quick, cutscene, walk a meter, cutscene, etc, etc. I get that they want to push the story, but let us play through it and have lenthier cutscene instead of chopped up ones that add no real value to the game at all.  This especially happens towards the end of the game.\n-Last one and I'll call it a day, the last two \"boss\" fights if you want to call them that, were really lackluster.  I was expecting a fight or some type of assassination, but neither of those happened.  I felt really shortchanged with a, \"That's it??\" to the fight.\nI really wanted to give this game a postiive review, but the cons outweigh the pros.  I would only recommend this to someone who is a history buff and wants \"participate\" in American (US) history.  Other than that, it's not a very strong game.  For those who are fans of AC, go for it, if you're not and want to get into the series, I would go for AC4, which is what I should have done in the first place.", "hours": 30.4, "user_id": "76561198031283148", "username": "SirBonkers87", "products": 42, "early_access": false}

The worst part is that the distance you have to be on the tailgating missions is just horrible. The stealth is also laughably bad.\nI guess the engine is pretty cool though, the textures aren't as detailed as revelations, tbh. Animals, denser foliage and snow that actually packs down when you walk on it is super cool, though. The facial animations are terrible, though. The game runs pretty well on my system as well, there's a real bad lack of graphical options though.\nOne final thing, oh god, I have no idea how they screwed up so bad on this, but they thought it was a good idea to add regenerating health and removing armor. It's such a pain in the kneck, your health never regenerates right either. It refills so slow.

Ships are amazing. But again this game is not a ship simulation. So sorry, but game about assessin's where most of the time you can't choose how to kill an enemy and instead you are forced to watch cutsceen followed by \"Press LeftMouseButton\" indicator is not a good one. Just to compare in older ones of course you had this \"100% sync\" objectives but still it was you who had to do running, sneaking, jumping, killing (with those few restrictions to do them right way to gain 100%). Now in most main quests it's just press \"Forward\" and when you reach destination \"Press LMB\". In addition to stupid and sometimes luck based restrictions to do this or that - in older AC games, those 100% sync restristions had some logic behind them now, mostly non.\nThat's the first and main let down, scripts and stupidity, I want to play not watch the movie and points that forces me to do something stupid just for 100% won't make me any more amused.\nGoing further, freerun. Never ever was I so frustrated with AC game, our main character doing whatever he wants just because \"fu** you, that's why\".\nFighting. They said \"we made easier interface, less buttons\" I said \"maybe just give us PLAY button if you don't want us to actually interact with game\".

Not like in AC Revelations where they were an asset. Here they feel forced and useless.\nPlot - I like Desomnd part, whole thing with ancients but the part about our main Animus character is colourless, boring, plain. All plot twists (big words... I don't know if you can say plot and twists in this case together ;p) feel not right and makes you stay in game for just few more minutes. Also main character himself is deep like a puddle. Yet another frustrated guy without a plan, making stupid things EXACLY NOT LIKE ASSASSIN should do them... Not like Ezio, not like Altair, not like any other Assassin. Period.\nSummary:\n+ Ships\n+ Forest and not city like zones\n? Hunting (amusing for a short period of time, and sadly devs didn't use it's potential - forgotten in mid and late game)\n? Buy/sell via caravans (nice, but you could not care less)\n--- Scripts, scripts everywhere, cutsceens \"Press button\" (for 5min straight) periods\n- Freerun\n- Fighting (too easy + with messed up movement and grabbing things you don't want to grab, annoying)\n- Stupid and luck based 100% sync requirements\n- You won't feel like assassin, more like frustrated native American without plan\n- Other assassin's, could gone as well\nSadly only 5/10 in my opinion. Seems like scraps of meat glued together with some fancy colour papers and shiny powder riding on amazing horse called Assassin's Creed series.

The viewpoints are lacking where all the docks won't be shown and any flat territory out of range.

Now that thats over and done with, on to the review. I just recently finished my second playthrough on the pc of this game, and after playing through AC 2 and Brotherhood again recently, i have my opinion on this game. The combat isnt bad, but it is in no means challenging at all, as compared to AC 2. I could spend all day killing red coats or patriots till my hearts content without dropping a beat but, where's the fun in that now? The free running is back and more frusterating than ever, although not nearly as bad as 2 where i was about to rip my hair out on several occasions. It works, the tree hopping can be a bit buggy but mostly its fluid. Buildings, besides churches and save for a few other structures, are not really that tall. I remember this being a concern for many when the game was originally announced but fear not, you wont spend mins climbing up yet another tall structure just to have conner jump all the way down to his death (well, it happened once). On to the story. Its an AC game, i personally like the story line (thats more hurumph than huzzah) but it works to move the story along. However, the 7 hr tutorial as people like to call it, was not a welcome addition. In fact, it didn't even teach me the basics! Since i jumped from brotherhood to 3 i had to re learn the controls all over again. I figured out how to counter, grab ledges and other things on my own (i didnt figure out how to disarm till i was almost finished with the game). Conner is an over dramatic/ montone character. I am highly partial to Ezio's character because he seemed more human, his whole life was fleshed out before you. Unlike conners who you are just thrown into and meant to assume the role of this revenge seeking assassin. Without spoiling anything for you gents and madames out there, expect to hear alot of grunting and screaming for charles lee. The naval sections were a fine addition to the game (they made a whole game out of this section in the 4th game which i highly reccomend you check out) and were both a pretty spectacle and a liberating feeling. Theres nothing like sailing around martha's vineyard and blowing them bloody red coats out of the water! This is not an AMERICA HUZZAH!!! story, not in the slightest. The lines between the templars and assassins morality is somewhat blured in this game. You can see the templars struggling for their vision and in a way, they are good in their own regard. Without spoiling much else, i'll give you the bottom line\nBOTTOM LINE:\nGET IF YOU: like the AC games and are playing through, like the revolutionary war, or just like the colonies before they became american\nDONT GET IF YOU: Don't like any of the things mentioned above, want to deal with a tedious story, or are expecting something thats going to knock your socks off\nIn the end, I DO RECOMMEND because i have been a fan of this series since the first game came out in 07. This series continues to bait me and bring me back into its ever widing embrace. Though the series has started to lose some of its focus over the years, they are still able to weave a very compeling narrative.

That being said, my feelings are in no way to deter anyone from playing the game. There a few things that make this game stellar and more things that make it rather lackluster:\nPros:\n-Amazing graphics, with beautiful scenery and (new!) changing weather\n-Likable characters, although lacking in development\n-Even more possibilities in battle and free roaming\n-Tons of stuff to do\n-Historically accurate (most of the time)\nCons:\n-Glitches everywhere. Aside from falling through the floor a couple times, they didn't really ruin the game, but invisible Benjamin Franklin was rather disconcerting.\n-Plot inconsistencies and strange pacing. I won't spoil anything, but if you actually look at some of the situations logically,  make little to no sense. Sometimes the characters do things completely contradictory to their personalities. As a person who essentially played this game for the plot, it was rather disappointing.\n-Tutorial spends too much time on plot and not enough on actually explaining\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Stores are a little bit difficult to find in the beginning and the game spends little time describing what can be upgraded, discovered, etc. I didn't even recruit any Assassins because it was too much trouble. And they just briefly describe how to manage the homestead and the like.\n-Several nearly impossible sync missions. While the previous games have had difficult quests to get 100% sync, some of them in this game are near impossible due to glitches or bad programming. One asked for an air assassination in a place where there was nowhere to air assassinate from. The quests themselves sometimes had rather disappointing glitches or problems that were overlooked. There was a one quest with a follower that was strangely prone to being shoved into the water by civilians.\nToss-up:\n-Battle mechanics. They've become harder, which is not a bad thing in and of itself. The problem lies in that sometimes the mechanics are glitchy and lead to some strange situations like enemies clipping through walls. In one instance, I threw a redcoat down the well, but he didn't die and so he kept trying to kill me from below. Harmless, but rather annoying.\n-Good guys vs. Bad guys. Ubisoft said they didn't want to villainize one side over the other. Instead, AC3 villainizes several historical figures, like good ol' George Washington. Nothing wrong with that, so long as it's historically accurate. The problem is that although the head of the Patriots may not be a \"good guy\", the Patriots are clearly favored. Although it's supposed to be Assassins versus Templars, it ends up looking more like America versus Great Britain. The game developers claim this was not the case, but after playing through the game and seeing how almost all of the targets were British or Loyalists, it's kinda hard to say the game doesn't favor the victors. Some people might not find issue with it, but I found it rather annoying since it seemed like the game developer did a real half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665job on trying to emphasize this point.\nTL;DR Play this game if you want a conclusion to the first four games. Unfortunately, it has quite a few problems and glitches that take away from the overall enjoyment of the game. If you can overlook the aforementioned cons, then you ought to have a great time. Expect to invest a lot of time to enjoy this thoroughly.", "hours": 20.0, "username": "Kuroii", "products": 125, "early_access": false}

The regenerative health system is dubious, the combat feels more random (heavies could take half a dozen slices with my knife all over the body, but a light kick to the gut that sends them into a wall auto-incapacitates? what?), the naval combat is iffy on a good day, and the economy menu is more a chore than a boon.\nWell, aesthetics enthralled me, so I'll go with that.\nMany dislike Connor.  I find him very interesting, and he may be my favorite Assassin yet.  He is hopelessly idealistic and naive, and very overzealous in his actions.  His worldview is incorruptible.  But his drive to improve, to accomplish, to learn, to grow, and to correct make him an exceptional student and a humble individual.  He is clear and concise, ever-poised to tackle any trouble that arises.  He doesn't shirk from a challenge.  His gumption precludes him to action over tact.  He cuts straight to the point and loathes the time-consuming inner politics of the Patriots, Loyalists, and Templar.\nHe's a thoroughly profound case-study, but most players obviously don't catch that from his words and deeds on face value.\nMost Assassin protagonists seem to be playboys of their time, accepting drink and women when their work allows them.  Connor pursues a more morally-upright ideal; I know of only one time Connor consumes alcohol, and I don't remember him settling down with a woman at all in AC3.\nEzio and Connor are both stealthy (Connor's a freaking hunter, lol; he \"has\" to be), but the difference between them is the former had subtlety and grace, whereas the latter has swiftness and decisiveness.  I loved that about Connor.  The manner in which he acts, the style of combat he adopts, both reflect his mores as an individual.\nRegarding the setting, it's bafflingly empty.  I'd argue 60% of the collective world map is unused for anything beyond filler.  It's wonderful filler, in my opinion, but it's empty space all the same.  Viewpoints are sparse, far between, and don't provide much vision once you synchronize with them.\nCombat may prove troublesome, but the animations in battle are a sight to behold.  Connor is flashy, but efficent.  Brutal, but quick.  I'm enraptured with awe every combat sequence I initiate.\nThe hunting is a solid addition, too.  It's far too easily abused, but you do have to play it smartly if you want to succeed.\n--\nI don't like relying on personal patriotism for much of anything, certainly not for a review of a video game.  However,... I believe it's an integral part in how I perceived and enjoyed Assassin's Creed 3.  AC1 had a great story, even though the setting wasn't my favorite.  AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations offered better combat, but I didn't care for Ezio as a character.\nBut AC3 struck a major chord with me while I was playing it.  The open space of the Frontier (as opposed to the cramped cities in Renaissance Italy and Crusader-era Middle East), the (little \"r\") republican community of the Homestead, the righteous (if incomplete) theme of the Patirots, the ferocious style of Connor's combat, the resolute demeanor he exhibits, the pristine settings in the wild, and the boundless opportunities of the major cities of a land brimming with potential,...  All of that sank in well with me.  Maybe it's relatable since I'm a red-blooded American.  Maybe the sights and sounds of the wild Frontier hearkened me back to my days as a Boy Scout.  Maybe the visuals of colonial Boston and New York warmed me to their nostalgia and nuance.  Maybe the theme of liberty and the reinvigoration of the moral struggle between the Assassins and the Templar sparked my interest once again.\n--\nI dunno.  I sure can see why people don't like it, but I don't share that sentiment at all.  I had a blast with AC3, so I will suggest it nonetheless.  I hope others like it for what it is, as well.", "hours": 50.7, "username": "Anax of Rhodes", "products": 379, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

New gameplay have much bugs and just stupid. Best Multiplayer was at Assassin's Creed Revelations.\nSingle player: this is new story (in start you play for Assassin which join to Templars, this man father of protagonist), new locations: Boston and New York and other few: West Point, Frontier (big location with forest and so on) and the most important locations - this open ocean and the sea, where you can complete quests on the ship. You can upgrade your ship. And Manor where you will got quests with people, which find home or work. This people will work and live here. You can craft items they are even with the help of (I like that).\nWeps: you got new assassin knifes, tomahawk (my favorite wep), pistols - you can have 2 pistols at belt.\nGameplay: this Brand New gameplay: you can use the objects around you, absolutely new combo murder. New management is very convenient. You can also jump on the trees, fleeing from persecution through the open door or window (in cities). To game added dogs, which can find you :D At city walking much pigs, chickens, cats and dogs (to game add kids :D) - you can interact with.\nGraphic: this is an entirely new open world with new opportunities. For example: change in the weather (winter and summer, periodically snowing, rain and sunshine, and if you fall into the snow, then the character will slow down). In the game there is dirt on the pavement, as well as pools, stepping on you left a footprint. So, graphic is very beautiful.\nStory: new story this is Revolution in America. That is very interesting... But some time it's start bored. You play for Indian, which must kill few bad guys and him father. Indian join to Assassin's. He is want freedom for all people. But this guy don't help to Revolution, but he thought that it helps. He just wants to save his people - what can I say about this man? He is egoist. He says that everything should be free, and his father (Templar) said that freedom - is chaos. And his father was right, because if all people are free, everyone would do what he wants and how he wants. If you manage people, then they will not be as savages.\nIf you do not manage the company of people, they go mad.\nBut in the words of the Assassins have the same truth.\nManaging people do not need to resort to violence and slavery.\nAs I see it, I Templar :D\nSo, this game is not for the faint of heart, there are a lot of cruel dramatic scenes.

I've already played up to the 3rd in the series, including Brotherhood, and I wanted to see how the series was holding up before moving on to the fourth. To be honest I am sincerely looking forward to play a pirate assassin in the Caribbean, regardless of the technical issues associated with the game. Slogging through what has a reputation as being the most flat game of the series is just something I had to do for continuities sake.\nNo spoilers, but you kill a bunch of redcoats.\nIt is very flat. The opening sequence was surprising, but it takes too much time for the sake of the story. The main character should induce some emotional reaction in me, but he is distant and inhuman. His reactions are inappropriate for the circumstances most of the time, and I believe this is the biggest problem with the character. Let's be honest, if I can't relate to the main character and his struggle it becomes more and more difficult to pick the game up time and time again.\nThere are other ways of doing this rather than introducing emotionally drawn out sequences that are meant to be motivational food for the character. Countless other games have a silent protagonist that I identify with more, probably because I can introduce my own voice as I play the character. No, the dissonance that is established by the time real game play comes around is so pronounced it is impossible to recover from.\nHere was the first glitch I came across.\nFloating Cannonball!\nThe reactions of other people to the main character are also unbelivable. Names like Sam Adams, George Washington, and Benedict Arnold are commonplace. But their reactions to a Native American running critical messages, assassinating leaders, and commanding troops is unbelievable. Not that a Native American isn't capable of these things, it's that at the time there was such cultural stress that the looks and attitude in the game don't match what I would expect. Shattering my expectations from history destroys my immersion. I know that since it is a game it isn't supposed to be accurate, but accuracy in some things is necessary for immersion. Especially for an alternate history series no matter how they may change things around. It is a difficult balance to hit, but missing the target all together isn't an option for a major studio like Ubisoft.\nSo there you have it, my two biggest complaints with the game. I'll leave it there, because there are so many articles about the technical issues plaguing the series. Hopefully I can be more enthralled by future installations of the series, and get back to the feelings of wonder that the second game left me with.\nBlog at:", "hours": 12.9, "username": "BigDadGamer", "products": 286, "early_access": false}

Not goin to go into the story as others already mentioned in their review.\nAnyway my only gripe is about the combat that has been somewhat staple fo the AC series. I find it right now too much like the Batman Arkham games. Counter > attack, Counter > Attack. It's kind of dull a too easy in a way. The only alleviating thing about it is more of the trying to get full sychronization like not getting detected Silent kills  etc. I've heard black Flag has better combat though.\nIf you're a completionist like myself that this has plenty to do. Finding all the almanac pages, synchorinzing all the high locals, hunting every creature etc. It does a great job of that.\nOf course everyone has their personal opinion this game is well done, keeps my attention long enough.

Assassin's Creed games generally have pretty boring characters\n+ There is a lot of stuff in the world to discover and find adding a lot of replayability in the post-game\n+ The Stealth missions are really fun if you are in to stealth mechanics\n+ The relationship between Connor and his father is really fun and it actually gets quite a few laughs, good laughs.\n+ The historical setting is well used. Connor actually affects the American Revolution rather than just lives during it.\n+ Like many other Assassin's Creed games, the enviroments are really believable and do seem like functional cities\n+ The season changes and the forests added a different more nature feel which I liked.\n- The AI is dumb... like REALLY dumb. I often would follow a Redcoat patrol around and stab members of it. I figured out that the AI does not even notice that someone is dead until they hit the ground so I could take out half a patrol before anybody noticed anything. Then, when they did discover the body, they did not attack me, they pushed me twice and then kept on walking. Also, guards can get stuck on objects.\n- There is a lot of features that I don't care about and so I ignore them.\n- The whole story element about the world ending on December 21, 2012 REAAALLLYYY dates the game and makes the modern-day story feel weird when playing in 2014.\n- Desmond is a pretty boring character, as usual.\n- If you're this big hero of the American Revolution, why don't the patriot soldiers fight at your side in free roam? that confused me.\nAll in all, I would say that this game is definately worth the $5.00 that it costs when it is on sale.

Ive played it now about 7h and Ive to say I dont like this game at all! Im very disappointed actually. And here is why:\n1) Gameplay is horrible. It is even worse than in previous versions. The shooting and aiming is hard (perhaps that is the point cause firearms were not as good as they are nowdays..) The combat is too easy. Its all about pressing E and then mouse button and you always succeed in killing. In previous versions you actually faced hard times if you faced too many opponents at the same time. (Why games today has to be too easy? Im kinda missing 90s when games were difficutl)\n2) Graphics. Hey please! Who honestly can say this game has awesome graphics!?! Have you ever seen Crysis? Or new Deus Ex? or Witcher 2? Even Witcher 1 has better graphics than this game! It is horrible! Draw distance is low, all faces are just about same and mouth sync is HORRIBLE. And gamers say the graphics are good? No they are not. And yes - all my graphics settings are as high as possible.\n3) I just cant sync with this character. What was his name? I cant even recall and I played the game few hours ago. It was easy to sync with Altair. Easy with Etzio. But not with this one (honestly Ive no idea who the guy is!). Horrible.\n4) Gameplay... hiding etc is horrible. corner kills doesnt work always cause well.... even blind guard would see if half-body is lurking behind the corner. Come on!!! And all tasks and the \"prize\" you get from clearing all missions 100%.. Im glad I read how pointless the prize was and stopped even trying to max the game.\n5) Buy this game only if you want to finish AC series. And buy only if the cost of the game is less than \u20ac5.

And contrary to whay many people say, UPLAY is not a big hassle once you understand how to use it.\n: The game is the same overalll experience as the other asssin's creed games. But a little better. The fighting has been overall much better and well refined, and the animations are overall smooth. Whenever you finish off an enemy, you get to see a satisfying finishing animation which is a lot beeter than the previous ones where the enimies that you killed just dropped dead when you finish them. If you are used to playing on a controller for AC, there should be little problems as you transition to a keyboard and mouse, as the devs have mapped put the controls well. The only problems I had with the gameplay was the inconsistant climbing. There would be many times where i wanted to climb onto a building, but instead only could jump off a wall and into the nearest haystack.\n: Assassin's creed's presentation has amazed me one again with its amazing graphics. The world is beautiful, and it is your playground. There is a lot of detail in the world of AC3. For example, you will have trouble traversing deep snow. In the city, you got city vendors and the citizens all doing their own unique actions! Textures for trees and the water in the oceans are well put together as they look like the real thing. However, the draw distances are not very far. So if you look at stuff from a distance away, the textures will fall flat. It is also worth noting that character models look very weird in this game. If you look at them, what is supposed to look like skin and hair, just looks like flat drawn out textures.\n: To play this game, it will require a very moderatly good gaming rig. While my computer specs may not seem top of the line, they were still good enough to handle the game (check out my specs on my profile description). The frame rate in this game is consistant and only drops when in populated areas of the city.  Outside of the city, frame rate holds steady at a good 30fps for me, so it is should be noted that if your rig can handle the city at the beginning of the game, it should well be able to handle the big country side, no matter how much weather effects there may be.\nWhile AC3 may not be the best edition to the series, it is a well put together game and well worth the money you pay for it.

He matures over time both morally and character wise. I love connor honestly. Yeah he's got some anger issues but so did everyone else during this time period. I mean why wouldn't they be? Unfair laws, people abusing their power, land both from settlers and natives being unjustly taken. Come on people of course everyones\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off lol. I actually enjoy the story a lot and for the record natives actually did help with the cival war. And don't say they tried to over involve connor. What do you do in every single Assassin's Creed game? You get involved in major historical events. Boston Tea party for example the developers made a joke using Connor because originally it was said the people dressed up as indians. Anyway games pro's and Con's.\nPros:\n+Even if they should see you in some of those bushes lol. Stealth is fully avalible in this game. If you can't stealth you're doing it wrong lol. I love being able to hide in the trees and such.\n+The huge open world you can explore this game is beautiful and huge.\n+The armory. This is always nice so you can always switch back to old gear if you want. It's in the manor's basement.\n+Again the story is actually really good. The \"Movies\" People made of this game are good but they don't even tell you 50 to 70% of the story for Assassin's Creed 3. There is far more development then what haters say for this game and what movie makers have shown you. You really gotta play this one to get a real opionon on it. So its worth buying in a sale.\n+Hunting. This is awesome and a very fun way to pass the time. It makes great amounts of coin\n+Developing the land of your neighbors and doing side mission. I actually enjoyed these. They are very entertaining.\n+That spear whip  haha. I wish I had it in the other games.\n+Costumes. More ways to customize the character are always fun. I know it's not new but always nice it's there.\n+The Ship battles. This is the game that intro'd it as far as I remember. Very very fun very very smooth ride and sailing.\n+Being able to call a horse from anywhere. That's always a plus. Them ninja assassin horses lol.\n+Suprisingly the underground tunnels. I actually had a lot of fun exploring them. They are very large and whindy. It took me an hour and a half to explore it all.\n+Again developing the land, if you enjoy such things, another way you can do this is through managing your trading, buying, selling that sort of thing.\n+The mini game where it's like chess or checkers. It's suprisingly a very entertaining game I can see players with a lot of money just sitting there and playing it for a few hours lol.\n+And the little ways you can distract a crowd now and dissrupt guards. Throwing money and causing a Riot are always fun lol.\nCons:\n-Having to play as Connor's father in the begining of the game. I don't give a flip about his dad I want to play as connor lol. I'd rather them just explain his story then make you play as him. If he is suppose to be a tutorial then his gameplay is way too long lol.\n-Having to play as Desmand. I love Desmand as a character I really do. But I do not want to be forced to play as him even if its only a short few times. These should have been purly videos not gameplay.\n-Not showing the controls as Desmand. I still go wtf to this...Yes we are now in reality but we are still in a video game. That isn't challenging that's just stupid and annoying lol.\n-Sometimes the controls feel unfamilar, had to get used to it and modify some controls back to the way the other games function on the pc. As well as to simply making the controls feel more comfterable to your hands.\n-Wolves are extremely over powered in this game lol. I can kill bears. I can kill puma's aka cougars...but the wolves dear lord. And since they obvously are always in a pack you have to deal with at least 6 to 12 of them. Trust me people climb a tree throw down some bait and assassinate. Rinse and repeat until you get them all lol.\n-My biggest pet pev with this game is I have had to look up way too many guides on how to do some things because the game is not clear enough I will go down the sub list for this. :\n1 It does not explain truelly how to lock pick. This is one of the first things you do in this game. PC wise I found out you must rotate it until you can hold it. Then move the mouse down straight, do so slowly so that you can get the click. Then you just click one of the mouse buttons until you break it. It's very simple once you understand how to do it though.\n2 This game does not give a fair amount of instructions and or info for missions 50% of the time. What I mean is half the time the game wants you to do something it's not clear. I'm not expecting word for word lead me on like a child sort of thing. For example the game tells you as an option you don't have to kill the guards but when you do cause maybe you got caught and felt you had no choice. Instant mission fail. Now why would it tell you it's an option if you have to do it that way?\n3 Sometimes it takes way too long to load up where to go for a mission. I'll keep checking the map on where to go and maybe it will have been 20minutes before it finally shows the \"!\".\n4 And lastly the marker on this game is horriable sometimes. It doesn't show up most of the time. (The green shape). Until you are I don't know 200 to 300 meters from your destination?\n-I HATE how the game will randomly change your weapon. I don't think this happens often but the game decided to repace my sword that I love and rock with. With a Two handed axe during an assassination mission. No not a tomohawk...A flippen two handed axe like a broad sword. I am an assassin why in the hell would I want a two handed weapon!? lol.\n-The game does not explain you have a armory...lol. It's in the basement where you first got your assassin outfit just so you know all. So if the game decideds to switch out your gear just go back home and get it back.\nSo to Sum it all up. I actually really love this game I do. It could have easily gotten a perfect 10. But sadly due to the little things that kinda screw it up I can't give it more then a 7.5 out of 10. It's worth playing but only after you can get it on sale. I paid 12 dollars because I got the DLC.  Again I highly have enjoyed this game I am really glad I baught it. It's a great way to pass the time because of the little things you can do to pass the time. Sailing a ship. Developing land. Hunting. Just walking the town and doing mini mission. Heck you can just ride around on a horse if you want. So yeah great game guys. If I gave it a higher score and ignore the little problems. Then I'd give it a 8.5 to a 9 at least.", "hours": 131.6, "user_id": "76561198141161185", "username": "KhansQueen", "products": 70, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 264, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-12-01", "text": "I highly recommend this game, legit. Fortunately, I never had any of the bugs other users have talked about. I've had more of them in AC3 or Black Flag, but I'm sure that's in uplay's court. Anyway, technical stuff aside (other than controls, I'll get there), I really did enjoy this game for a multitude of reasons. Some of them may be faults to some people, but hey, that's why this is my review.\n1. Characters\nHoly gosh darn dang did I love the characters in this. Knowing a bit of the plot helped, since at first I was ready to just kind of trudge through Haytham's sequences and found myself absolutely loving him. He's got that dry British humor that made me love Shaun, but with more... I dunno, Haytham. Of course, I was really hyping myself up the whole time for Connor, and he didn't disappoint me at all.\nHe has a ton of personality, which seems to be a complaint for some people? I read a few reviews where people said he seemed flat and boring, but I found it to be the opposite. He acts in that partial-teenager-never-quite-grew-up way, and that hyphen abuse is very intentional. He's got a temper, has a heart the size of the entirety of Boston, and his black and white view of the world is almost refreshing in a way. It makes you frustrated, like maybe shaking his shoulders through the screen should be an added feature to the game. But that's the point, I think. He's tangible and believable, even if sometimes he seems, in his own words (out of context), \"Unbelivable!\" (Cue the player throwing their hands in the air.)\nAlso, not to abuse the word 'refreshing' much more, but it honestly is just that to first of all, have a Native American character that isn't some garbled caricatured stereotype, and secondly, to have them *voiced* by actual Native Americans. I won't say it much, but good on you, Ubisoft, if just for that.\nSo aside from me essentially worshipping Connor over here, onto the next thing. (And take a moment to remember Ziio. Remember her. Love her.)\n2. Missions\nI'll admit, some of the missions had me ready to just give up. Desynching for even being seen for a second can be hella frustrating. One mission in particular during one of Haytham's sequences comes to mind, with having to eavesdrop on soldiers by following them through a fort. I probably failed nearly twelve times before I eventually got the hang of it. Obviously, stealth isn't my thing.\nFor all the click-and-drag of some of the missions, there were quite a few I really did like. Some of the battles were really cool, and the Midnight Ride mission was pretty fun, actually! There's quite a few where you have to put your thinking cap on, but it's pretty worth it if you just think it through. Otherwise, throwing your weight around seems to work just great.\n3. Side Missions\nBEST. THING. EVER. This game stole another piece of my heart just for these awesome things. Helping Homesteaders, sending out convoys, naval battles, minigames galore, and collectibles? Yessss. I actually got bizarrely addicted to the convoy system to the point I probably spent the better part of an hour just being the best business person I could be. Cue Connor getting eye strain from staring at the accounting book for so long.\nThe collectibles were stupidly addicting to follow up on. Captain Kidd's in particular was great, if mostly for the trinkets that were crazy hard to get. I'm still yet to get all the feathers, but I'm set on it still!\nAnd hellooooo naval battles! Nearly everyone I know who has played this game thrived on this part. I think the only disappointment I had was that there weren't more of them. The system was easy to use, but that didn't mean the missions weren't challenging. I got desynched quite a few times, even if the system was second nature to me by then. It wasn't too annoying though, since it made me just want to try harder to win the next time.\n4. Controls\nThe controls were pretty simple! I never had a problem with them (unlike AC2 where I mixed controls up frequently). Probably the best thing is that the controls aren't prompted on screen by symbols anymore. Not so much of the 'PRESS KEY SHAPED LIKE A HEAD. NO, THE OTHER ONE, STUPIDO. GOOD. NOW PRESS THE HAND ONE. NO THE HAND HOLDING THE THINGY. NO THE OOOOTHER ONE.' Catch my drift? Now it's just 'Press E. Good. Goooood.'\nThat being said, like all PC games of this nature, button mashing was like a cheat code thing. Any combo of left click + space + shift + E key worked. I rarely got killed unless I got mobbed by guards, so that's a thing. But hey, nothing I can complain too loudly about.\nThe freerunning was also excellent in this game. Running through the Frontier and the Homestead in particular was ridiculous fun. I also like the added physics of Connor being a bit larger and more cumbersome than Altair and Ezio, and so having to hoist himself up to get anywhere. Nice touch, yep.\nThe only thing I had trouble with was the QTE system. That is, the hunting button-slamming controls. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, and you can get mauled pretty easily if they fail on you.\n5. Plot\nI've heard a lot of complaints about this part, and to some degree, I can't totally dispute it. The plot did seem pretty dry and repetitive at times, if only for the whole *SPOILERS* Kill the Templar, Getting a Stern Talking-To From a Dying Man, Feel Kinda Bad spiel. Like you get you're supposed to be on the fence, but there is a point where you're just like OKAY CONNOR, GET A WIN, BOY, GET A WIN. You get the general idea that his life sucks and his choices aren't always stellar.\nFollowing the American Revolution was pretty interesting, even if it did seem like they just sort of squeeze you into the corner like an old mop. Oh, cool, you just saw the Declaration of Independence get signed? Radical, now get outta here. That's sort of the gist with that.\nSo yeah, it was kind of a saltine cracker at times, but it moves quick, which is nice.\nAs for Desmond's plot, well, most people know how that one went. Feels bad, man.\nTL;DR: Seriously, give this game a chance. If you're pretty meathead melee-junkie, it might not be too fun. It does make you think, both in a philosophical way and in a logical way. It's fun, it's challenging at times, and the side missions are great. Go for it.\nADDED STUFF: -It's a little disappointing that Ubisoft didn't follow up much on Connor after this. I get the *SPOILERS, AGAIN* life-threatening injury thing, but at least in novel format or something, it would have been nice. There's very little to be seen about him afterward, and so far everything's been pretty doom and gloom. Pretty disappointing.\n-This game deals with ye olde racism, and it definitely wants you to be uncomfortable. \"But why would you put that in a gaaaaame?\" you hear a distant voice whine. \"Well,\" you can say all knowingly, \"That happened back then. A lot. Like all the time.\" And then punch the closest portrait of Washington in the face. Do it.", "hours": 77.8, "username": "ClockworkCourier", "products": 58, "early_access": false}

After completing Brotherhood about 8 times and capping in the multiplayer, I worked my way about completing Revelations, the first game, and the second game. The first game I suppose was poor, but it lead to great things with the Ezio trilogy. When AC3 was announced, I really wasn't very fussed about it. This was originally because I personally like games set in older time periods, although I still considered getting the game once the price had gone down somewhat. What my friends said to me dissuaded me from it, as some of them are interested in the series just as much or more so than I am. When AC4: Black Flag was announced, I hoped it would be more appealing, and indeed it was! But after completing this wonderful game, I felt a sense of being incomplete, and considered maybe the game wasn't as bad as I thought.\nRecently, the game was on sale, and my girlfriend (who had only owned AC4 so far) bought it for cheap. She apparently had played it before, and I later learned she'd actually completed it before, and she said it was a great game. I wanted to see what she was going on about, and it was cheap, so I bought the thing.\nI loved it at first actually, people complain about the whole tutorial part of the game, but I really think Haytham was a much more interesting character than anybody else in the game. He was intelligent, cunning and ruthless. Everything you want in a Templar, right? Unfortunately, playing in the open world was not properly allowed as Haytham, and soon enough i'd be placed in the shoes of some kid playing hide and seek. We then had a few cutscenes, and a village being burnt down, which was interesting, and I thought the plot would be restored again. It was, I suppose. The plot wasn't really -that- bad, it just wasn't interesting at the best of times. Before Connor becomes an Assassin, this short duration of time is really extremely tedious. I stopped playing for two days before returning.\nLike every AC game, the characters (historically, not in the modern times) have been very strong and entertaining. AC3 is no exception. Especially the Templars on show here. Well, Connor is an exception. He lacks the humour that Ezio and Edward have and has no redeeming characteristics. Each of the assassinations on the Templars are unfortuantely very boring and not exciting. The death of the final (de facto) boss was really quite stupid and wasn't as meaningful as I had expected and hoped. I think it says something when one of the most exciting parts of the game is a tea party.\nMost people seem to be saying that the controls of the game are 'clunky'. I disagree, and this is the first time i've played an AC game on this platform. Folks say it's glitchy too, but compared to Revelations and the brand new Unity, it's not very glitchy at all from my experiences.\nMy favourite part of the game was the homestead missions. I always liked building up villages in little IOS games, and I enjoyed the added bonus of meeting the characters who lived there and doing more interesting and immersive activites with them. The trading system that accompanies the homestead is frustrating, and you'll have a much harder time making money than in other games. The game almost seems to have as many side missions as Brotherhood, but I really couldn't be bothered to do them, as they all seem very similar. I captured a few forts, but they are mostly identical and unlike the ones in AC4 are not exciting or rewarding. Very little is rewarding besides the homestead.\nTowards the end of the game I couldn't really be bothered anymore and I only pushed on because I liked the modern parts of the game a lot and wanted to see the end. I was unfortunately disappointed, as were many people, but to be honest I was expecting it really. It's not as bad as people say.\nDo I recommend this game?\nIf you are American, you will probably love this game. Folks like their own history usually, especially you guys. Gameplay makes up for the poor story but the gameplay is wasted on Connor and his missions. I think it's worth getting this game when it's on sale, or if you have played the rest of the series, or are trying to play in order. I don't think you should skip it like I did, it's still a good game and concludes Desmond's story nicely.\nAlso, HMS Jersey is the ugliest ship ever to have sailed.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 267, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-11-28", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae III is the fifth major installment in the long-running Assassin's Creed series developed by Ubisoft. The original game had you play as Altair, an Assassin during the Crusades, while the other titles had you playing as Ezio, an Italian Assassin during the Renaissance. After four previous games, Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae III had large shoes to feel; for the most part, the game fulfills these expectations (despite disappointing on other fronts).\nIn this game, you play as Connor, a Native American Assassin born during the American Revolution; after a lengthy introduction sequence in which you play as Haytham Kenway, Connor's father (who is easily one of the major highlights of the game), the player gets to experience the early stages of Connor's childhood and experience what puts him on the path of joining the fabled Assassins. This game has a very slow opening which takes around 5 hours, however I would argue that this is necessary due to the epic scope of the narrative; however, impatient players or those wanting to get straight into the action might want to reconsider.\nDue to Connor's Native American ancestry, there are a number of unique traits you can use, namely that of hunting, tree climbing and other variations of activies used in previous titles. The ability to free run through the trees is a very welcome addition to the series, and scaling large trees and natural obstacles feels almost as fluid as navigating the rooftops. The addition of a rather complicated hunting mechanic (which involves setting bait and traps as well as skillful use of bow and arrow) is interesting but feels rather unnecessary to the rest of the game, as the game rarely offers incentives for hunting out various forms of wildlife. I also found the quicktime event used when encountering certain animals (wolves, elk) to be rather silly and didn't really mesh with the rest of the game. In addition to those skills, Connor also has a tomahawk (a large axe-thingy) and a rope dart, which he can use to damage enemies as well as stringing up enemies from trees. This varies the already simplistic combat to a minor degree and allows for some entertaining situations. Just like previous games, you also have a gun and typical sword which you can both use in open combat.\nOne of the best additions to Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae III is the new naval combat mode; in this mode, Connor undertakes a variety of missions using his own sea faring vessel dubbed 'The Aquila'. Naval combat is extremely fun due to the varied offensive techniques such as precision guns, heavy mortars and chain shots, all of which you can use to take down enemy ships and forts. The reason this mode is so fun is because it's rarely used in any other game to date, and is one of the few innovative features displayed in this game.\nWhilst the majority of Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae III is up to the standard of the other titles, it is worth mentioning the several severe faults that I felt detracted from the overall experience. Firstly, the 'mission constraints'; these are a series of optional objectives attached to each story mission that give you the option of increased synchronisation within the Animus. My issues with these constraints is that they actively punish the player for trying to complete, or made the mission extremely irritating in general. These objectives simply pushed the player to the point of inconvenience, and I consistently felt as if they were tacked on to each mission rather than challenging the player due to the ridiculous nature of the tasks. My second issue with the game was the overall story and the character progression of the protagonist Connor; as in the narrative lacked the motivation and compelling nature found in previous titles, and Connor was actually a severely bland character to play as. The narrative starts off rather epically, until you start playing as Connor and achieving virtually nothing over the course of the game. He was sent from place to place, completing tasks that seemed to have no relation to one another and often just for the sake of throwing in some big, flashy historical moment. By the end of the game, I felt as if all I had achieved was going to a bunch of random locations and killing some British officer simply because the game wanted me to. Aside from the standout performance exhibited in the character of Haytham Kenway, there were hardly any moments where I was overly impressed by the characterisation. Connor is a bland and uninteresting character, whose motives are ambigous and murky, and who I could never truly connect with. Not to mention that the ending for both Connor and Desmond is astonishingly lazy and is one of the worst endings to a AAA title I have ever experienced.\nOverall, Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae III is a solid entry in the franchie but not the ground breaking step forward I was expecting. All the standard trademarks of the series, and fans of the series such as myself will undoubtedly have a good time with this despite its flaws. Its worth noting that the lacklustre story and frustrating game design will frustrate some players and occassionally feels like a step-backwards from previous titles. However, this is a still a fairly enjoyable game and I couldn't help but enjoy myself for most of it. 7.5 / 10", "hours": 23.7, "username": "PrimalHunter", "products": 458, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

This game wasn't nearly as satisfying as it's immediate predecessors and was riddled with lots of annoying redundant tasks. I never did any of the hunting, caravaning, crafting, or any of that nonsense. At least in the AC2 trilogy every side mission also helped forward the story somewhat and kept the ball rolling on the overall story.\nIn AC3 there was just too much stuff to do that had nothing to do with the story at all. It's really easy to get caught up running about picking up all the useless crap strewn around that's not releveant to anything. What story? It starts out totally different from how it ends, and in some places it felt cobbled together. It wasn't really that bad but seemed like I've heard it before somewhere. I guess I kinda knew what was gonna happen before it happened. There's a few twists here and there that make the story more interesting and I particularly liked how the story shifted from how the game started. I don't remember exactly when I said \"screw this\" and just focused on the story missions only just to get through the game faster. I was disappointed with how short the story was, but it ramped up from about the halfway point and got pretty badass towards the end. I thought the VERY end was really intense for a few scenes. A lot happens and I won't give any spoilers.\nThere were a few neat new mechanics occasionally thrown in here and there but not really something that would warrant playing this game again. I wasn't blown away with the combat since it was really easy to parry and counter and barely took any skill. Although some of the executions were pretty damn awesome. If 2 guards attack at the same time and you get a parry on both at just the right time, there's some sick almost QTE like double and triple executions that are pretty cool.\nThe voice acting in AC games is always really good so at least there's that. I didn't need all the Native American dialogue but it made the characters more authentic. I guess I just don't like reading subs that much.\nIn closing, I'd say if you play ONLY the story missions and don't waste your time with other stuff the game is worth playing. Rather the story is worth following along.

I paid a little extra for the \u201cdeluxe\u201d edition, which means it comes with all the DLCs, kind of like a Game of the Year edition.  Unfortunately, Uplay has a weird way of activating the deluxe edition. I downloaded the game through Steam, and upon launching, Uplay asks for the game key. Not a problem, since Steam has a little window telling you the serial numbers. But once I entered the key and the game actually launched, I had to type in the additional keys that unlock the game\u2019s DLCs one by one. I couldn\u2019t copy and paste, I actually had to write down the 3 serial numbers and type them in manually. There were a few hick-ups (server errors), but it went through eventually.\nStory with mild spoilers:\nIf you\u2019ve played the previous Assassin\u2019s Creed games, you\u2019ll know that most of the game is taking place inside a computer simulation, while in the \u201creal world\u201d the protagonist Desmond Miles is one of the last descendants of the Assassin brotherhood. Desmond is using a machine called the Animus to relive the genetic memories of his ancestors. In the real world, in the not too distant future, there is some sort of world ending natural disaster about the happen. Thousands of years ago an alien race predicted the disaster and set plans in motion to stop it (all the plans failed). Desmond and his companions are trying to gather the alien relics/technology to stop the apocalypse. To do this, Desmond is reliving his ancestor\u2019s memories to find where the items were hidden throughout history. Inside the Animus, the game\u2019s memories begin around 1750 in England and quickly move to the New World where you live the life of Haytham Kenway. Kenway eventually has a son with a Native American woman and 20 years later you take over playing as Connor, carrying on the Assassin legacy of fighting Templars.\nIn terms of gameplay, AC3 is almost identical to the previous games. It\u2019s a third person game similar to the Batman Arkham series and you spend a lot of time free running and climbing buildings. Combat seems to have been simplified this time around, and you really only use a few buttons: Attack, Counter, Break Defense, and Special Attack (gun). Since the game takes place around the American Revolution, guns play a bigger role than in previous Assassin\u2019s Creed games, but you still use your melee weapons 90% of the time. Ammunition is limited and reloading takes a long time. Like the previous games, you\u2019ll spend most of your time outside of story missions The Assassin\u2019s Creed games are open world with tons of side missions and collectibles. The most useful side quests are synchronizing viewpoints (climbing tall buildings to reveal large map sections) and unlocking fast travel points (exploring underground tunnels to create map waypoints). The underground sections are pretty boring, but the fast travel unlocks are time savers later on.\nYou can gain money in the Animus by completing quests and opening treasure boxes throughout the game world. The treasure boxes are usually locked, leading to a VERY annoying mini game where you need to pick the lock. The lock picking was clearly designed for console controls, not the PC, so it can be frustratingly difficult to accomplish (you use the mouse and need perfect vertical/horizontal control or you start all over). Fortunately, like most of the side stuff, the treasure chests are optional. This is because you really don\u2019t have that many things to spend your money on. You can buy new weapons (not much improvement over your default gear), treasure maps (so you can find more money - that you don\u2019t need), and ship upgrades (this is actually useful). The other collectibles in the game don\u2019t really do anything except increase your \u201csynchronization\u201d which is just your game completion percentage. You don\u2019t \u201clevel up\u201d in the game so there\u2019s no gameplay benefit to increasing your synchronization. I\u2019ve heard that the only thing you get from higher synch is unlocking outfits for you to wear.\nI mentioned the ship upgrades earlier, and the naval missions are actually a highlight of the game. At various points in the game, you captain a warship named the Aquila, and sail around blasting British ships. It\u2019s a lot of fun, which is probably why the next game in the series - Assassin\u2019s Creed Black Flag is based around pirate gameplay. The ship upgrades that you can buy are all extremely expensive, but can give you a tremendous edge in battle (improved armor and weapons). I ended up spending pretty much all my money on ship upgrades.\nPros:\n+Long game where you can spend all day exploring pre-industrial American and hunting various animals. The hunting is fun for a little while, but is kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things.\n+Engaging story, both in the real world, and in the Animus. The main reason I wanted to get this game was to see how things work out for Desmond in the real world.\n+There\u2019s a lot of variety to be found in the game. A lot of missions are stealth based while there are also times where you just need to slaughter everyone. The navy missions are a great diversion.\nCons:\n-Additional layer of DRM: Uplay. It\u2019s not as bad as some people make it out to be, but it can still be annoying, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to installation procedures and you need to open Uplay after launching the game through Steam (every single time). I\u2019ll admit I was worried when I heard that the game was badly designed for AMD processors/Graphics cards, but I didn\u2019t notice any problems. The game ran smoothly. Both my CPU and GPU are AMD (cheap ones).\n-Side missions/collectibles are basically useless, as outlined above. If the game had Steam achievements, I probably would have spent a lot more time chasing side quests, but as it is, there\u2019s really no reason for me to grind for collectibles or money. The whole \u201ccrafting\u201d system for the game was pointless since I didn\u2019t need the money.\n- There are some really annoying parts to the game, (such as the final chase sequence) but if you don\u2019t care about synchronization, you could blow right through the game. Most of the quests have optional requirements (such as \u201cdon\u2019t be detected\u201d). It really is as hard as you want it to be. One thing that really\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665me off was the 20 minute unskippable end credits of the game. If you just force the game to close, you\u2019ll miss the final cutscene (and next couple missions), and you can\u2019t alt+tab out of the game to let it run in the background (it just pauses).\nThe gameplay DLCs for the game are the Benedict Arnold missions, and Tyranny of King Washington (TOKW). The Benedict Arnold missions were pretty short, probably less than an hour, but the Tyranny of King Washington is quite long, possibly 5-6 hours.  TOKW seems to take place in an alternate universe, and include some \u201cmagic powers\u201d that make the game a lot easier.\nAll in all, I would recommend Assassin\u2019s Creed 3 to anyone who has played the previous games and enjoyed them. A couple of people warned me that AC3 is the weakest in the series, but I can\u2019t say I liked/disliked it any more than the previous ones. If you\u2019re a game trader, you can get the deluxe edition for about 4 TF2 keys ($10) when Steam has it on sale.", "hours": 52.7, "username": "widgetguy", "products": 1432, "early_access": false}

Hardcore fans have even gone as far to say that this is the best game in the series. NO IT'S NOT! This game has way too many flaws and none of the mechanics of the game can keep it afloat.\nStory\nThis is where the game falls flat on its face. It doesn't get deeper than, \"See this bad guy? Go kill!\" Of course the beginning of the game shows much promise especially after a huge plot twist however it's after you get control of the game's main protagonist, Connor, that you get to see how one dimensional this game really is. It adds insult to injury when this extends to the Founders and even to the DLC! Speaking of which, The Tyranny of King Washington sucks just as much as the main campaign which has WAY and I mean WAAAY too many plot holes. For example in the DLC, the premise is that George Washington obtains the Apple of Eden and because of it's power, he becomes corrupt. It never ever tells you how he found the Apple NOR how Connor came to find or know about it. And yes just like the main campaign and how one dimesional it is, the main objective is to kill George Washington.\nGameplay\nAs much as I would hate to admit it, the game does actually function but not without its faults. For one, your character will still jump to his death. This has happened way more times than I'd like to count. Many times I'd spend 5 minutes climbing up a tree and for no reason at all, Connor will jump all the way down to the haystack. This caused a brutal reaction that made me throw my controller at my PC. Secondly, the combat is much more simplified than in other AC games. This in turn makes combat faster and easier to pull off kill combos. Enemies have also been tweaked in which some you can't insta-kill them but rather must disarm them first to hurt them. There is a bug I ecnountered where EVEN if you're incongnito, the enemies will still chase after you for no reason at all. The combat is nice and fluid but it becomes extremely repetitive and boring after just a few hours. There is no depth in the combat. There are a ton of side missions and collectibles which I literally skipped. There is no way in hell am I subjecting myself to that torture.\nGraphics\nAbsolutely beautiful! (I cannot believe that came out of me....) The main character models are nice detailed but I can't say the same for the NPC's. They're......more or less garbage. On a lighter note, old world America is gorgeous and the natural forest made my eyes j*zz. That's all I can say about the graphics, though.\nMultiplayer\nNot much to say here, since I only played an hour or so of this mode. It seems they made a much bigger emphasis on this than on the story since multiplayer seems to have its own story. Again I can't say much since I didn't much with it. Its basically the same as in Revelations.\nOverall - 5/10 This game sucks compared to the other iterations....\nNo matter how I look at it, this game still p*sses me off. I have wasted way too much time on the story only for the game to give me the middle finger at the end. The ending......That ending literally almost made me give up on the series entirely. I had hoped that the DLC would save it from the black hole but it didn't. It had thrust me deeper and deeper into frustration. I cannot recommend this to any casual fan of the series.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 272, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-11-17", "text": "I love this game. Despite the amount of bashing and vitriol over it being the worst game in the series, as of Feb last year it had reportedly sold 12.5 million copies. So not everyone could've hated it. Since we're two installments in, this review will contain spoilers later, but I'll warn about that.\nBut first things first - why I have put over 650hrs into this game (so far)?\nI find this game the most revolutionary of AC titles, BY FAR. Frotherhood bought the assassins, yes, but AC3 brought wilderness traversal, hunting, dynamic eco-systems, seasons, the homestead, different enemy types requiring different combat, cinematic dual counters and above all - Naval combat.\nMore has been added to this game than any other in AC history. You can just wander around and watch the world. Climb up a tree near a fort and wait for a cougar to stalk and kill guards! There's even an achievement for watching it happen!\nThis game had so much going on and also decent rewards for filling out the sometimes tedious side quests. I found it all really engaging and rewarding.\nSo why so much negative commentary directed to the game? There are several basic causes:\nThe usual issues with controlling your assassin. I accept this as part of AC. It's never been any different. ACIV felt slightly  better, Unity (when it's working) is worse. AC2 isn't great either. These are minor issues and a bit of a running joke to both fans and critics of the series.\nI had some minor issues with graphical artifacts every so often stretching out into the horizon, but these were more amusing to slightly disappointing. The bear models were also a disappointment after Red Dead Redemptions Grizzly's, but to be fair, these were black bears and all of the other animals were perfect, especially the cougars.\nThe lack of explanation for the new mechanics. This did cause me lot of frustration and wasted time especially during homestead missions. One in particular that requires you to observe the members of your developing community until I managed to figure out some of the \"rules\" with the help of the internet. Basically, some activities only occur during certain times of the day, or in certain seasons. Once you're aware of the rules, these problems go away.\nI believe the negative press comes down to 2 issues, which will have SPOILERS: The poor initial marketing and the inconsistencies in Connor's character as the story progresses.\nSo what was the big marketing blunder? Pre release, there was so much hype around the wilderness and tree traversal, that I and I'm sure most others, were chomping at the bit to try this out straight away. Ubi also made such a fuss about the protaginst being a Native American. Yet when the game starts, you're playing as an upper class British guy, named Haytham, who turns out to be your father. This was a surprise, butr due to the nature of the marketing, an unpleasant one. You begin in England, then sail to the colonies. When you finally arrive and find a tree and try to climb it, you scramble up a bit then fall down. I must've spent hours ignoring the game and just trying to run Haytham up a tree every time I came across one. I became convinced my game was broken somehow and raised a ticket with Ubi support. But when I gave up and plowed through the Haytham stage, and little Connor stage, you get suddenly introduced to tree running with adolescent Connor. All of that frustration could've been avoided by some better marketing pre-release. I can surmise that they left Haytham out so as not to spoil the massive twist that comes with his tale, but you could have explained the game was generational and new some new skills were specific to Connor without spoiling the story otr the twist. I believe the frustration and confusion about having to spend a quarter of the game not being able to do any of the new things so heavily promoted really detracted from the day one enjoyment. It left a sour taste in my mouth.\nHowever, as I started to explore this most epic of all the AC releases, I quickly forgot this as I went about exploring Boston, New York, hunting wild animals, training and recruiting the members of the Homestead.\nThis is the most involved and rich of the AC games, by far. There are arguments about some of the execution, but I can't find a credible argument against the scale and ambition of this entry. I have had to abandon ACU due to it's issues and ridiculous inability to support SLI properly, but if there is truly no wilderness or wildlife aspects to the game, it is for me a massive step backwards for the series, even after accepting the loss of sailing and ACIV's awesome addition - harpooning!\nThe other big criticism I've seen of AC3 is of Connor himself.If you look at the reaction of people to the games, it largely seems a reaction to how charming, or otherwise, the main character is. AC2 and 4 are frequently mentioned as highpoints, with AC3 being the disappointment, despite being the most innovative of all the AC sequels.\nI don't really see BF being a real improvement over AC3 the way other people seem to, other than Edward was much more entertaining, the same way Ezio was. Connor suffered from being being a dour sulk, although I've seen some of the lack of engagement with him as a protagonist explained away as the cultural differences that cause him to be a stoic. No, that wasn't the problem. Many of the most popular heroes in fiction are stoics - Batman and Conan to name 2. Connmor was petulant and inconsistent. The charm in AC3 was found in Haytham and Ben Franklin, but mostly Haytham. In fact, many people, myself included, found Haytham to be far more interesting and likable than Connor.\nMASSIVE SPOILER ALERT:\nI lost empathy and understanding with Connor when he finds out that his lifelong hatred of Charles Lee was based on the mistaken assumption that he was the man responsible for his mother's death, presumably under Haythams direction. It was actually his erstwhile ally, George Washington, who had been going around enthusiastically exterminating the native villages. Earlier in the game, after proving capable of dispatching literally hundreds of armed guards at a time, Connor decides to engage in a philosophical debate about assassin's versus templars with a target he really hates (when previously, we were just stabbing them, then having a chat) and gets taken out by two (2!!!) guards and ends up in prison. Connor doesn't come across as a determined stoic toward the end, but a petulant, vengeful and stubborn child. That was what broke the character for me, not any sense of cultural difference. He kills his father with annoying emotional ease. During that scene, I really got the sense that Haytham was going out of his way not to seriously hurt you. Then you just stab him in the throat. There's no suitable explanation of his motivation in the concluding chapters. There was no real compelling reason to kill his father. The vision said his father had to die, but would you stab your father in the throat because a ghost told you to? There was no sense of Connor being conflicted over this (although he was over many other things), of making the hard choice, he just seemed petty and spiteful instead.\nEspecially when he finds out Lee wasn't responsible after all for his mother,\nbut kills him anyway and lets Washington off scott free.

I'm playing this again.

The textures are very detailed and the Boston looks great.\n-Great controls, they are a complete improvement over the older ones.\n-Interesting back drop being the American Revolution\n-Decent open world with a pretty large wilderness\n-fun minigames(I like checkars myself)\n-Changing Seasons(Very nice feature)\n-Naval Warfare!(ACiV blackflag makes this a moot point)\nCons -Typical AC dreck story. Who ever thinks this writing is \"smart\" is an idiot. Its very cheesy to me and honestly the whole Animus Templar thing needs to stop. I hope the Templars win and end this doggy bag of a story. They do not need it. Simply make Connors story; or if they wanted to be smart make all the stories and link them at the end. Anything outside of the historical elements seems dull. How about you send us to the 1700s and let us do whatever.\n-This is the weekest story, excluding what I am hearing about Unity. Again, drop the Animus and tell a good story with accual historic fact.\n-No true historic facts. Its all scewed, and sure dates and loactions might be right but not true to what happened. A little known fact... Valley Forge is not north of New York and west of Boston. That would probably be Canada. I mean how they portray Gen. Washington wronge is one thing, but moving Valley Forge(that was in the center of 13 Colonies to Northen NY or Canada makes no sense. The distance between the two is like if in AC2 you have Tuscany and then fast travel to Berlin that just North of Venice.)\n-New York City. 15 years in the future New York City(around 1790s)this would be a boom town, but as shown here its not. At this time it was just a port. The fact that they chose NY city here shows Ubisofts ignorance to the time period or the country. The obvious city to pick is Philly. It changed hands a few times, many battles were fought near there(not to mention Valley Fodge is like 10 miles away from there. Or is it in Canada...), and it was one of the biggest cities in the Americas rivaling Boston and exceeding at this time. The other city would have been Richmond to pick over New York and this is the one I would have picked. It would have been different and there for more interesting. Still, theres a number of more interesting cities. This is history, so teach us some history. Don't show where Wall Street will be in a few decades. Richmond would have displayed slavery and given us more of a moral issue. Again Philly would have made a lot more sense.\n-A lack in weapons and outfits to pick from.(won't everyone know you're an assassin if you wear that stupid hoodie like a tool. Should we be blending... Or a Native in Boston wearing a hoodie like a shady teenager be a little obvious)\n-Feels very hollow. Even the hunting. There is little immersion even with good graphics.\n-It makes you play it their way. I don't like hand holding at all. If I want to do what I want to do, and I think this is where all AC are held back. I don't get why you can't kill civilians. The guy is an assassin. Who sneaks up and kills unarmed people for personal gain. Thats a pretty heinus person if you ask me. So this murderer is only suppose to murder who they want murdered?\nStill all things considered it has its moments and I do like roaming the streets and changing the weather. It has its share of problems, but I do like it. It just could have been so so much better. Still if its on sale pick it up. Its a decent play through even with its flaws if you care more about free roaming. Its just not ACiv or to lesser extent II, and its history told by someone who never study or looked at a map. Or have any idea how to make a decent story. Or any clue how to be a decent assassin.

Which is really what this series has become.\nAssassins Creed III offers players the same usual tried-and-true method of free-running, quick combat, and strategic third person platforming that all the other entries in the series have offered up til now but, like its predecessors, also brings with it a myriad of bugs, problems, and unpolished features.\nAs usual, AC is never well ported to the PC, so the first thing to understand about this game is that it's not meant to be played on this platform. At least not if you want to enjoy it without frequently running into bugs, errors, and other issues.\nThe second thing to understand is that if you've played AC before (and it's safe to assume you have if you're playing the \"3rd\") then you're not going to get much in the way of new. Ubisoft saw fit to add some new features and the ones that they've added are admittedly somewhat nifty. But the bulk of the game rests on what we've been doing for the last 4 iterations in the series.\nStory is good, but not great. There isn't much more to be said for it. It is begins picking up after a cliffhanger and ends on a cliffhanger. Everything inbetween is just getting from one to the other.\nAtmosphere is decent. I enjoyed the frontier of freshly colonized North America but deeply missed the mosques, temples, and spectacular history that filled the other titles.\nAll in all, AC III isn't a BAD game, and it definitely isn't a GREAT game. It's simply an AVERAGE game. The only problem with that is that AC III is a AAA title. It's not unreasonable to expect a great game. And yet...here we are.\nTL;DR = Good, but not great.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 273, "page_order": 2, "recommended": false, "date": "2014-11-15", "text": "I should've listened to warnings... My friends who played this game warned me that it's bad and it's going to put me off the AC series. They were right.\nI'm not going to complain about the optimisation and technicalities. It's not horrible, playable even on my old-ish rig. My main issues are:\n1. Dull plot.\nIt's difficult to care about the protagonist or his plight. The prologue of the game is actually reasonably interesting plot-wise (albeit definitely too long - takes almost 3 hours!!!). After that, it gets worse.\nNot sure, might be the fact that I'm not American so I don't really care much about their revolutionary history - apparently most of the people Conor meets are somehow famous, but since I recognise only a few names, I can't feel excited when he meets yet another guy who tells him how important it is to do this and that and yadda yadda yadda, ZZzzzz.\nWhat's worse, it's not entirely clear what the conflict is. Seems assassins want to kill templars only because they are templars, even though their goals in the colonies are somewhat aligned (getting rid of the Brits) - most of the time it looks as if Conor was fighting the templars because he holds a grudge, nothing more. Anyway, the plot is slow, uninspired and dull. If you thought Revelations had poor plot... this one is much worse. Revelations at least had an interestig city. Cities in AC3 are almost identical, bland and boring - absolutely nothing to look at, and famous spots look nothing like they now. Seriously, who thought setting the game in the British Colonies was a good idea?\n2. Game construction and mechanics.\nThis is just frustrating. Short walks or runs frequently interrupted by short cutscenes that don't really add any value. Then another short walk, another cutscene. A short fight, then a short walk, and a cutscene. Aaaargh! And it happens very very often!!! There are way too many missions where you have to chase someone, or tail someone, and soldiers tend to get alarmed by your presence for no apparent reason. Controls are clunky, after 20 hours of game time I'm still not entirely sure how the fighting system works and you don't really have that much assassinating to do... Oh, and parcouring in the forest - BORING and silly.\nAlso, this game feels like the most restrictive of all AC games so far. OK, in all of them your option to kill the target were seriously limited (it's not Hitman after all), but this one is totally ridiculous at times with laughable stealth and frequent instant failures. Feels extremely linear too but the most annoying fails are caused by stupid bugs, like Conor sticking to walls and buildings because game developers decided it will be a great idea to have running and climbing under the same button...\nThere were numerous moments where I considered giving up after yet another fail for stupid reason like that, and just watchning the rest of the endless cutscenes on youtube. I even attempted that once, only to find out (to my relief) that I'm nearly at the end of the main story, so decided to get on with it. Phew. And as I said - the story is dull and the only reason why you may want to actually suffer through it is to see Desmond's fate and for plot continuity before I move on to AC4.\n3. Shedload of stuff to do but none of it worth your time.\nYou can hunt, trade, expand your homestead, attack convoys, craft stuff, take control of city areas, conquer forts etc. The problem is - you don't really feel like it's worth your time. You won't get much out of it. Some money, that you can live without. Unless you're an OCD sufferer who just needs to do every single mission and achievement, you will completely ignore those side-subquests. The game will, of course, force you to suffer through some of them just to show you that you can do them, but after that... you'll most likely ignore it. Kind of like the tower defense part in Revelations - after the tutorial you probably never bothered. AC3 has about half a dozen useless elements like that.\nHaving said that, the only element that seems less boring is sailing. True, after a few missions the novelty wears off as well, but at least it's fun (no wonder the fourth game expanded that part) and there is some sense of achievement when you sink a larger vessel. Expanding your ship is very tedious though, as it requires a lot of money and the economy of this game is just broken.\nPrevious game had this neat system where you simply rebuilt shops, banks and whatnot and were getting the income from those. Here, you have to craft stuff with some ridiculous and tedious crafting system, then you need to sell stuff via trade routes and such, you can send assassins to do missions but it's nowhere near as simple as in previous game... All this feels like an intentional timesink and amounts to sheer frustration - it's really been a while since I played a game that annoyed me so much.\nIf you enjoyed previous AC games (even Revelations) - stick to them. Skip AC3 and give AC4 a try - apparently it's much better. Although me, after finishing AC3, I will probably have a short break from the AC franchise.

Once you get to play as the Assassin, you actually have to play as a little kid and do some weird hid-and-seek and hunting missions. Finally, you get to start your career as an Assassin. Although, you don't actually get to assassinate anyone until a few sequences after that.\n-Another thing I need to stress about this game is that in cities, you cannot stealth kill guards without getting five more of them attacking you. Once you have five guards on your hands, then more notice, and you have 10 to 15 guards attacking you. Eventually, your health will be too low, and you will be forced to flee, without even killing all of them. Also, guards detect you instantly when on rooftops, so if you are looking at doing building parkour and aerial assassinations, I would recommend Assassin's Creed 2, or any other game in the franchise, for that matter.\n-Also the multiplayer does not work at all. My game crashes when I start it.\nPROS.\n-The game wasn't completely bad, though. Some of the missions are outragously fun, like the naval combat and the mission where you assassinate the British officer. (Although you pretty much have to do the aerial assassination on him, because if you don't, you will have to battle through 50 guards to get to him.\nFINAL VERDICT.\n-Wasn't worth my time, and most of it was very boring or very hard.

Rather than the entrepreneurial opportunities of\n,\nand\n(henceforth referred to as \u2018the Ezio games\u2019),\ngoes for the\napproach of \u201ccram our half-baked narrative into as many historical events as possible, as prominently as possible even if it means introducing massive time jumps that are at odds with the central plot device\u201d. Ah, yes, Desmond and co. are now searching for the key to a First Civilization temple in the memories of his ancestor Haytham Kenway, a debonair British killer tasked with travelling to British colonies on the east coast of North America to locate the temple itself. Upon arriving in Boston, Kenway meets a young Charles Lee literally as he steps off the boat, and from here begins recruiting young men (arbitrarily all well-known historical figures) to what we assume is the cause of the Assassin Order for the game\u2019s entire first act.\nCool, this makes a lot of sense, we need to find the key, we know Haytham has it, so we just find out where it ended up, very nice. Except for some mysterious reason, once Haytham does find the temple, it turns out he cannot open it and we jump forward ten years to meet Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton,\n. Why? We don\u2019t know. This would be fine if it actually enhanced the story in any meaningful way, but all that really happens is\n. Meeting this Assassin, our hero is dubbed Connor and taught all the skills required to be a master assassin without so much as a montage. Only at this point does Connor confront the powerful colonial Templars, whose schemes range\n. The game is so far past the setup phase by the time it kicks off in earnest that the franchise\u2019s signature map-filling sidequests inevitably fall by the wayside because by the time you\u2019ve gotten around to liberating all the districts from British control you\u2019re probably already done with the main story.\nIt\u2019s too bad the writers didn\u2019t commit to Haytham as a protagonist, because he\u2019s far and away the best character in the game, with all the sharp wit and barbed remarks of Ezio from Assassin\u2019s Creed II delivered with some phenomenal voice work by Adrian Hough. Connor being introduced isn\u2019t just disappointing because of how great Haytham is; the whole changeover is handled horrendously, with all of Connor\u2019s development and progression (as well as all the potential for an interesting character) going out the window, handled through actual monologues by him basically saying \u201cand then I trained to be an assassin for many years and now I\u2019m fantastic\u201d. The overall structure is obviously difficult to handle, what with needing to have introduce who Haytham is and what he\u2019s about, but it's hard to see how it could have been handled worse. It sucks that\n, but it takes him something like 9 years in the game to actually bring this up again in a way that would imply it\u2019s bothered him. In the end the revolutionary war itself is secondary to Connor\u2019s weird, angry obsession with killing Charles Lee since the twist is that\nConnor\u2019s obsession with protecting a village we\u2019ve seen exactly twice also falls by the wayside in the end, meaning that during the last few missions there is actually no motive to the weirdly prolonged assassinations.\nSpeaking of which, let\u2019s get into that juicy, juicy gameplay criticism.\ntakes few risks on the gameplay front, with a handful of hit-and-miss mechanics tacked onto an existing formula of \u2018run around, climb on things and win fights with obscene amounts of armed, formally trained enemies who will attack you one by one\u2019. Combat has been simplified from\n, relying more heavily on counters and slowing the game speed to a crawl to let you choose what type of counter you want to use. The trick is enemy types differ only in their resistance to specific types of counter (the \u2018Boston Brawlers\u2019 series of fighting tournament-style sidequests becomes pitifully weightless after you figure out that every enemy that isn\u2019t crippled by disarm-countering their every attack loses quickly to being countered near breakable objects). This, combined with the huge time gap between musket-wielding soldiers taking aim and actually firing, makes for a combat system that makes it easy to win fights of any size without taking a hit. I\u2019m not sure when (or why)\nturned into a brawler, but it really shouldn\u2019t have. When you are forced into a now-obsolete stealth approach, the best way to go is with gratuitous abuse of the only new stealth mechanic - hiding in any tall grass or foliage automatically. Stealth kills from the grass instantly hide the bodies and no matter how many bodies you stack up in a single bush, their friends won\u2019t spot your cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 of corpses. Tall grass often spreads out over large areas, essentially giving you free range of forts for easy infiltration. It almost seems like stealth was an afterthought - like the developers would have rather made a game where you just roam large forests and look at all the animals they\u2019ve put there. I\u2019ll admit, the frontier is a really great location. Free-running in the trees is something a little different, and stalking patrols from above before springing on them with rope darts is admittedly pretty cool. Sounds like a great location for a franchise that has historically focused on large-scale free roam, right? What could go wrong?\nI\u2019m not kidding, if you want a reason to explore this exciting new type of location you\u2019re going to have to run around chasing all the little fetch quests that litter the map like patches of bland, filler-centric acne. New York still sounds like a cool city to roam around in on paper, except when you consider than in the 1770s the average New York building was about as tall as my attention span is long.\nHands-down the best part of\nis the naval combat, which is slow-paced enough that you can consistently be effective while still quick enough to be more action than strategy. There are a few too many \u2018try not to hit the rocks!\u2019 sequences, but the fights themselves are good; they are at least good enough that I\u2019d much rather play the naval missions than anything else in the cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that is this game. Nothing illustrates this more than the fact that the follow up,\n, was the best game the franchise had since 2009. Once you start spending more time sneaking up on (and subsequently \u2018assassinating\u2019) the local fauna than actual enemies, you know you\u2019ve gone way too far into the \u2018\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing about in a historical setting\u2019 for the game to even be salvageable.", "hours": 174.4, "username": "Oke'd", "products": 626, "early_access": false}

Theres quite a bit to do from naval combat (I'll get to that in a sec), hunting, and picking a fight with the British.\n-Naval combat: It's certainly something new, it's really fun and cool when you get in a fight, making aim and send cannon balls hurling through the air, destroying their ship as you see fire and splinters flying everywhere.\n-Hunting: Something new, you can head into the woods and go hunting for materials. There's some intersting things to use like snares and bait.\n-Historical moments: This I loved. There's a lot of different moments straight out of your highschool textbook, like The Battle of Bunker Hill where you hear the famous quote, \"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\", The Declaration of Independence, and more. You even meet historic figures like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and a lot more.\nCons:\n-Story: The entire story of Connor goes like this, as a child, your village was burned to ash and you want revenge. That's it. The story in a nutshell.\n-Characters: As far as characters go, Connor (The assassin) is a bit dull. He's not hatable or anything but i found Altair and Ezio to be far, far more interesting and likable. Haytham is more interesting and I almost liked him more than the lead protagonist, Connor.\n-New parkour: Oh boy, this i wasn't very fond of. When you're climbing the rooftops of Boston, the guards on the rooftops will demand you get down with little time. If you don't, they'll try to shoot you off. If you fight them, a horde of soldiers will pop out of nowhere and still try to kill you. It's completely unnecessary and it gets your blood boiling when all you wanted was to cross a rooftop. As for the tree parkour, it's cool but theres only so many trees that go in so many directions. Parkour feels like a major step back.\n-Combat: Don't get me wrong, it's actually really fun and you feel like a badass taking on ten soldiers to one. Some enemies even need different strategies to kill. Some you can kill directly, some you need to break defence first, some you need to counter, break defence and kill. But, it gets real repetitive. Counter, kill, counter, kill, counter, kill. it doesn't have much challenge to it.\n-Replay value: There's little to nothing to do after the game. Either you run around killing soldiers for no reason, hunt for no reason, run around for no reason, there's nothing to do after you're done with the game.\nDespite what I said, ACIII gets my virdict of 7/10.

I imagine that it came almost as a shock to fans of the series. You play as Connor, a half-Native American, and half-British Assassin. Compared to the extroverted and charismatic Ezio Auditore from AC 2, Connor is almost the complete opposite. It may be hard to like him at all by solely doing the main missions.\nThe storytelling seems to fail from the start. In the beginning, you play as Haytham for a good while. His sequences act as an unnecessarily long and exposition-filled tutorial. Thankfully, as soon as Connor becomes a full-fledged Assassin, the game starts picking up the pace, but the storyline is okay at best. Since I was never fond of the modern-day storyline anyway, getting pulled out of Connor's story a couple of times was a drag. The ending for Desmond is very unsatisfying.\nThere's not much to be said for the main missions, but some of them are incredibly boring, like eavesdropping or following people. Be warned, though, that the battles are a COMPLETE disappointment -- you aren't even allowed near the redcoats.\nSide-missions are a mixed bag. Fort/liberation ones are quite fun, as you can approach them in different ways, like sneaking around or running into the thick of things. Naval missions are undeniably awesome and intense, offering a feeling of badassery as you obliterate enemy ships. However, the other missions scattered throughout the world are not very rewarding. At the very least, I do recommend playing the homestead missions, as they show a more likable side to Connor.\nThe weapons and equipment you are given covers a wide range of ways to kill, and there are different enemies to prevent button spamming. Regrettably, I found fighting *still* way too easy. Enemies will, for the most part, take turns and watch passively as you slaughter their comrade.\nOverall, I'd give Assassin's Creed 3 a 7/10.

Aggrivating, long, hand holding opening: Seriously, it took me around 5 hours to get to the good stuff. You're constantly tempted by the larger world before you're turned loose in it. This game will give you the worst blue balls.\n2. A main character that is much less interesting than other AC characters. You'd think that a mohawk warrior would be a pretty interesting character to turn loose in an AC game, but Connor ends up short of more charming characters like Ezio and Edward. He's a bit boorish, and often leaves the player questioning his motives.\n3. A world that is, compared to other AC games, a little unremarkable. The varied tropical setting of Black Flag and the distinctive cities of II are a little more interesting to explore than this world. Upon first immersion, the entire world is gorgeous. The frontier is a joy to run around in and some great new character animations make the veticality and velocity of free running in the cities FEEL great. However, after 8-10 hours, the settings begin to blur together a bit. Boston and NY don't feel aesthetically different, probably because they are missing the gorgeous landmarks of the other games. This isn't so much a problem with the game as it is with America's frankly pretty boring architecture (seriously, how do we call ourself a great country when our architecture is this unremarkable?).\n4. A large amount of auto-fail missions. This is especially a problem when stealth is concerned, considering the stealth is generally pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\nOTHER THAN THAT, this game has been good enough so far for me to put 17 hours in, and I plan on putting in more. The visuals, while they can be repetitive, are far from drab. Like I said before, the character animations are great. Crowd mechanics are nice. Freerunning is, as always, a joy.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 281, "page_order": 2, "recommended": false, "date": "2014-10-29", "text": "*SPOILERS*\nI have a love-hate relationship with the AC series. The first presented a fascinating concept, while being a tad bare-bones. The second I find to be far and away the best of the series, managing to balance that precarious line between the momentum of telling a story, while providing the player ample freedom and fresh experience. Brotherhood is where I began feeling the wheels start to fall off, and much the game seemed to cram you into a particular playstyle. I get why this is done... since you are in the Animus reliving your ancester's memories, technically, you \"should\" be doing things exactly as he did. I've never really liked the Animus gimmick however, in part because I like open world games that actually breath the sense of freedom, rather than chide and wag its finger at you going \"oh no, no, no, that's not how we want you to play the game!\"\nI find everything from Brotherhood onward involves a fair bit of trial and error, and the game feels the need for \"realism\" to the point that things start feeling more like a tedious chore than a test of ingenuity. It becomes less about finding creative ways of accomplishing a task (which I typically attribute to the open world formula's greatest strength) and this paradoxical \"linear open world\" where you have to follow the directions or else suffer the penalty. This is not \"difficult\" per se (although I admit a lot of it is me zoning out and not paying attention, so I admit I'm a tad lazy), but it does get tedious.\nThe problem with AC III is that unlike Revelations or Brotherhood, the positive parts don't quite make up for the glaring bugs, flaws, poor design choices (the god-awful UI which is clearly designed for a console and where it will sometimes literally bug out and I'll have to Ctrl+Alt+Del just to exit the trading menus).\nHaytham Kenway is the only part of this game I really liked... he's charming, clever and intimidating in a way that only serves to further remind me of how bland Connor is. The brief relationship where he and Connor work together is the most fascinating part of the game and the only reason I'm glad to have finished the game.\nDesmond Myles annoys me. Part of this is, I admit, that I think the whole hoody thing is so NOT inconspicuous, but really, the character himself I just don't like very much. In a way, he's right, in the sense that he's basically an errand boy, just as the player is an errand boy, forced to follow the objective marker rather than think of novel ways to solve a problem. These restrictions that have plagued the AC series since Brotherhood I find suffocating rather than liberating. Call me old fashioned, but I like open world games to have a level of freedom and choice that doesn't really fit the AC universe, especially with the whole Animus gimmick of \"syncing\" with your ancestor's memories.\nAC III has bad horses, the combat is basically a glorified set of quick-time events, the game has actually forced actual quick-time events on you, and let's not forget that the bushes you hide in aren't exactly convincing. The game honestly feels like it was rushed\u2014it feels more like a blueprint that was pushed into publication before it was ready. There are segments in the narrative that feel legitimately rushed, like certain cutscenes never got put in, resulting in a flow that feels rather choppy.\nAC III has its share of babysitting missions as well as a host of other tired AC formulas like deliveries, races, and recruiting new assassins. I skipped virtually all of these. Even viewpoints I basically skipped over just to finish the game, because they somehow lack the sense of scale or grandeur that you got from Constantinople, Roma or Firenze, for instance.\nAll in all, I'd say skip this one unless you're really into AC series. I have not played Black Flag yet, and the only reason I forced myself to finish AC III is that I'm a stuborn dumbass that finishes games he doesn't like simply for the right to rant about them afterwards.\nAlso, I find the whole Desmond Myles Vault thing utterly tedious and I really don't care for \"THE CHOSEN ONE\" nonsense (yes, that's right, I consider it nonsense). Here's hoping Black Flag alleviates some of my many grievances with the AC series that have grown like tumors with each iteration. I am also annoyed with Ubisoft for 1) forcing third party DRM (which is confusing to navigate, so great job there, Ubisuck) and 2) they seem to be WAY too sequel happy. I feel like they are milking the series for all its worth and attempting to stripmine every last bit of history for yet another sequel to sell us. It feels more like pandering than genuine development of a compelling narrative, although I admit the whole \"Matrix\" type story isn't what appealed to me in the first place with the series.\nI put up with the Desmond sections simply because I like historically faithful (ish) games that attempt to capture the spirit of the times (something that AC I and II I felt have captured better than any of the other games). I know some people do enjoy the matrix type elements, but ultimately, that's just my personal taste for not being terribly keen on them.\n5/10", "hours": 18.2, "user_id": "76561198061217733", "username": "hal0hal0mc", "products": 164, "early_access": false}

He's always brooding, sporting a melancholic attitude and the passion for those around him that you felt when playing as Ezio is non-existent. But if you can get around that you'll delight in the new parkour system through the trees and mountainous areas of the game which is a refreshing change of pace and terrain from the long-standing series.\nAdded to that are the glorious naval ship battles on the high seas which are incredibly fun and tactical as shots need to be timed in order to hit the vessel you're targeting and not get wasted in a rising wave for example. Navigating in concert with the direction of the wind is also important and makes for a joyous and riveting series of battles on the high seas :D\nThe game also concludes Desmond's story and while it's great that he finally begins to shine physically as an assassin, he's as whiney as always and his ending is seriously anti-climactic and a head-scratcher.\n8/10", "hours": 59.9, "username": "Valassi", "products": 211, "early_access": false}

New players will likely be overwhelmed by feature-creep pop-ups with no clear explanation of where to go or what to do.\nThe main storyline is overshadowed by the protagonist Connor: a self-centred, self-righteous, indignant ignoramus. Not the most empathetic of characters and irritating for the most part. The collection quests are mostly a time sink which add little to the game. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I couldn't explore the crafting system due to lack of instruction, buggy controls and a terrible interface, so I was forced to use Cheat Engine to earn cash.\nFor all its faults, the naval excursions saved this game.

Overall, skip this AC. Play the pirate one. Black\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665", "hours": 56.8, "user_id": "76561198130228455", "username": "Scoops", "products": 123, "early_access": false}

So, why don't I recommend it? Every bit of gameplay on land is exactly like AC 1. Jerky, abhorent, hard to move about fluidly without a controller. I am a person who plays games on the PC so he doesn't have to use the terribad layout of a controller. Do not map my keys, and the way the game works on a PC as if everyone wants to play it with a controller. We don't, and we wont.\nReason 2: The ending is worse than Mass effect 3. How is that even possible?! Oh, well, you know...That chase scene where charles lee must die. And we're also placed far enough away that we have to chase him, and he runs faster than Connor, and he must be followed to the green dragon, a cutscene will happen, blah blah blah storyline. It's a bad ending because you're offered no help, nothing, in moving thorugh the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 of the maze of the burning ship. You WILL die in fire a few hundred times until you figure it out.\nUltimatly, forget actually playing the final mission. Just go watch the ending on youtube and call it a day, becasue you WILL NOT be able to do it yourself, unless you could somehow always catch all the chase mission targets down in 2 seconds. THEN you MIGHT be able to keep up with Lee.\nThat ending mission feels like what most of AC 1 did; horribly untested, poorly coded, and a simply bad port to the PC. Can we get some quality checks back on games? I mean, come on people. That ending squence made Dark Souls:Prepare to die edition look better, more fluid, and easier to play than this. No actually, I've played Dark Souls before. It IS easier. Holy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, talk about 3 steps forward with the ship stuff and 40 back with the lack of work placed in the majority of the gameplay. I mean, seriosuly? I get stuck on invisible walls...running...trying to catch\nplace...forever failing.........\nSo, questions from this reviewer: Was any thought placed on the general on-land gameplay of the game, or was it expected that no one would notice that nothing has changed at all?\nHas anyone even bothered to point out that the end of this game alone knocks it down 2-3 points on a 1-10 IGN type rating system?\nDid anyone look at playtesting the obvious port to the PC?\nWas it a port, or was it really THAT bad?\nSo, if I was an IGN reviewer, I'd have to say 4/10.\nThe storylines are nice, but most of the gameplay is horrible. I can already tell that almost nothing in AC4 has changed for the land-based movement system, but I can see that they focused on their strong point....(Ships)\nWhile the music is immersive, it is often looked over by the loud cracks of cannon fire or gunshots, the clang of steel on steel or the really noisy for some reason footsteps.\nThe quests are new, and the combat system has been overhauled, but the controlls and feel of the movement remind me that AC 2 apexed the series and it has yet to get better.\nFrom what I've seen in the more recent AC Unity, it's no better. I'm not going to buy it until I see damn well what it's like. That mean something to anyone?\nLet me spell it out. Before buying any of these games, PIRATE THEM. I garentee you will thank yourself if you find that you absolutly hate it, you won't have buyer's remorse over it.\nAll I remeber was buying AC 1, 2, and all the DLC at the time of the release of 3 for some insanely low price, and buying 3 for about $10. But I'm not spending a single penny until I know what 4 will be like.\nSo yea, sorry if I hurt some feelings, sorry if I made people disagree with me, but this game does not deserve half the praise it got, and certainly not half the score.", "hours": 121.9, "user_id": "76561198039271135", "username": "calkhi", "products": 343, "early_access": false}

It's still awesome, tho.\nThe controls made me thrash my keyboard because i got so angry. So often i was running thru the woods or cities and suddenly Connor decided to perch on this one slab of stone slightly above the ground and then refused to jump off until i found the 5 degree angle where it was possible to leave. Also i often got spotted by guards because Connor decided to lean onto the wrong side of the environmental object which would have given protection from prying eyes.\nI found it extremely hard to feel like an assassin, unless the mission required to remain undetected. The guards spotted me so quickly and then it was almost impossible to hide again. Usually the guards are marked as red dots on the screen, but some just aren't, so Connor ran into them time and again when rounding corners and such. During the ensuing open conflict I felt more like a mass murderer. Luckily the combat was easy enough and death was only a rare consequence of these scuffles.\nAnd what's with these homesteaders? Why was effort spent on a useless feature to trade goods from your homestead? The revenue is totally unnecessary since i rarely had to spend any money and it didn't add much atmosphere in my opinion. I'd rather have the control glitches fixed than that.\nThe Mayan temple made me angry, because multiple times i found different paths to the shrine, but since i didn't follow the proper invisible way points, nothing happened when reaching the visible way point.\nIf you haven't played the previous parts, you will be quite confused about the present-time story and the First Civilisation, tho. It's not well explained.\nOtherwise, i enjoyed the atmosphere. The story was intriguing, the templar beginning and the temporary alliance with them is a nice twist. Learning more about native american culture (as a european) and the american revolution was fascinating. Running through the woods and hunting animals was a very enjoyable experience.\nThe graphics are good (not exceptional anymore on PC) and the musical score terrific.\nSo i still recommend this game, although it made me so angry.", "hours": 58.8, "username": "narkius", "products": 74, "early_access": false}

Gameplay and combat get 10. User interface gets 7.\nBelow are the points I think you will want to know about before you decide to buy.\n(I am about to write a guide for this that will add a bit more information sideways  if my 'wall of text' review does not cover all the bases for you.)\nPRO's\nCombat is a dream and movement, like the first AC, is not so dependent on your reflexes that you get frustrated jumping from one place to another. It's not a 3D platform game in any real sense of the word so that's a big plus for me.\nThere is only one place, in a cave in the NY undergound, where the controls are seriously confusing. It's a blatant spoiler, but use Forward + Right + Automove + JUMP to get b#past that stuck point. That's been the worst part of the game for me so far and I was pretty upset that I had to google the solution. It's actually pretty obvious once you know, but horrenous to work out otherwise.\nThe storyline, if you like getting a decent plot and background, is very well done and, 75% through the game I am still guessing at where it's going to end up.\nThe cutscenes are generally pretty atmopspheric and draw you into your character. They are also easily ignored if you prefer to focus on the hack and slash.\nThere are loads of things to do to the side of the main quest line and most of them are probably reasonably important by the time you get to the end of the game. Thankfully they are all mostly good fun.\nThe homestead is fun and promotes cash gain during the game. You don't really need to focus too much on gaining cash though I, personally, do not like having to be forced to go money grinding so I make it a sort of side quest to go stock up on saleables and send out a few convoys every few hours just to make sure I have plenty of cash to spare for those times when I might need it. There have been two times when that definitely has helped me.\nThe game is extremely realistic in many ways and this I love. As a learning process about that period of time and what sort of things happened and how, I'd have to say that AC3 is actually an enjoyable educaation, or would be if you choose to approach it that way.\nIn particular, the naval adventures (captaining a ship on the sea) are really awesome and I think Ubisoft could pretty much make a game out of those on their own. I loved them so much I could feel the spray on my face.\nThe game has loads of weapon choices and a good selection of vanity items to allow you to express your own personality while you play.\nWeapon choice, for me anyway, is always fairly critical, especially in a game like this where it affects your playstyle quite strongly, So all those different weapons are a great thing.\nI'm not much of a one for vanity stuff but, for once, I did actually spend time checking out each outfit and picking out the one I liked most.\nI'm 75% through the game with a completionist playstyle and 123 hours under my belt. That suggests another 30 hours of gameplay before I complete the questline.\nUnlike The Witcher 2, this game has extensive gameplay in there timewise and, unlike Skyrim, I won't get bored because of repeating the same basic mechanics over and over again.\nIf you like to think out the occasional puzzle and different ways of doing things, you will get some of that from AC3.\nCON'S\nThe game starts slow and then sort of restarts when you switch from the original character focus to the main character of the game. I think a few people find that a bit frustrating.\nAt that switch point, hunting can be really frustrating because there is no real tuition on how to deal with an animal that stalks and attacks you.\nThe ingame tips stay onscreeen too short a period of time to let you absorb them properly. They are actually very useful so its really frustrating to find yourself frequently going, \"Damn! I missed that!\"\nI hate the way the game does not let you rerun the last quest you completed. I tried to abandon it and repeat and lost all time on it entirely. IMO that is a very stupid bit of code there.\nMy biggest gripe, and I am really irritated about this, is the way the trading interface works. Setting up your convoys is extremely time consuming compared to how it could be ..\nThere is no way to stock a convoy entirely with all the same item, which is mostly what you will do. There is no way to automatically refersh you stock on all items manufactured on your homestead. For both these things you can spend several minutes, 10 to 15, just button clicking over and over again to do things you almost certainly will want to do en masse. Really, really bad user interface design there and it basically runis what would otherwise be a fun contribution to the game. Bad user interface means that this is a chore.\nThe anima database entries frustrate me. If the game gave me the option to read them as I went along, with an immediate popup choice box, or better a setting to always pop the little bits of history and info, then I would have read all the Anima database stuff. As is, I have read about 10% and have no intention of reading any more than that. As is, it's like the trading system, something that could and would have been a positive contibution to the game if better implemented.\nIf you do not like to think out the occasional puzzle and different ways of doing things, you will find some frustrating places in AC3.\nThe game does crash occasionally after several hours of play, though I have yet to lose any progress. I have an AMD/ATI system build and play at Normal settings.\nSUMMARY\nMy dislikes on this game are fairly strong. They are not really just irritations. They are genuine annoyances. They are mostly the point and click parts of the user interface.\nMostly I think the general inplay interface is fine. Combat is fast, furious and hellishly good fun.\nBut the support interface is one of the most annoying I have ever seen.\nThat said, the game overall is addictive as hell and really engrossing and immersive after you have been playing Connor for a few hours.\nI really like playing this game in spite of my gripes.", "hours": 143.6, "user_id": "76561198087702294", "username": "Latt Ice", "products": 126, "early_access": false}

From the beginning to about 15 hours in the game holds your hand. It dictated very exact parameters for how each mission must be accomplished with the slightest deviation causing complete failure. That along with the almost complete absence of stealth, the fact that pistols were better when Ezio was a kid, the way guards can spawn more guards so you're never doing anything less than murdering twnety guys in the streets), and the seeming randomness of your assassin recruits have all combined in a perfect storm to ruin the game for me.\n****very minor spoilers ahead****\nI may keep trying to play... but it doesn't look good. The point where I became truly frustrated is at is where I recruited my first assassin, an angry chef. I helped him go on a rampage through a city while telling him 'this isn't the way to cause change'.... that is EXACTLY what the games, all of them, have you do to 'cause change'. You murder hundreds of guards who could just be normal people looking to provide for their families but we assume are all templars and power hungry extortionists. Everyone knows it's ok to kill THEM without consideration. Also he's an angry French Chef.... and doesn't seem to wear assassin clothes but instead wears chef clothes and clevers people to death. Lame.\nThen my frustrations grew to a fever pitch a few minutes later at the Boston Tea Party. The first goal of the mission is to kill 15 guards. What an intensely subtle plot point. Not distract or remove.... just kill them. So I try to be sneaky. I slip into the water and as soon as I come up behind them (where they couldn't possibly see me) they become alarmed and shoot. Second attempt: the bow. The bow is supposed to be silent so I climb up on a roof and take a shot. I kill my man but everyone immediately knows exactly where I am.

It is enjoyable and fun, the animations of the charachters are great, actual key pressing for movement/actions is easy to pick up even if this type of game is not really your thing so it won't put you off playing.\nI bought this very cheap and got a lot of game for the small amount I paid for it. I got the extras included with my purchase so am very happy about that. I recommend this for sure and at the time of writting this, this AC was just \u00a36.50ish for a delux edition incuding DLC, and extras. 8 October 2014. Get it while it's cheap, you won't regret it even if you only play it once.", "hours": 18.3, "user_id": "76561198098038216", "username": "Lancashire ZZR1200 Biker", "products": 189, "early_access": false}

Sure, in the beginning it is quite slow, because it is the origin story of an half-Indian child who grows up to be trained as an Assassin. And we seee a bit of his childhood - but all of that is very important because what happens when he is a child, will shape things to come.\nBefore i get into some details about pros and cons, i will say the main game had no bugs, unless you count some instances in the Frontier where you are climbing rocks and it seems like the Assassin has hit a wall. But that is easily overcome by going elsewhere. It isn't game-breaking at all.\nCONS:\n- One big question mark: resources that are collected when you do missions (in the Frontier, for example) that unlock resources like wood, meat, other produce, metals et cetera, don't have any use other than gaining achievments in the game. Such as the achievment for sending convoys to NY or Boston(?).\n- certain objectives (which allow you to gain Full Syncronization) are kind of pointless in terms of the specific part of the story which you are playing through during a memory. Certain objectives, for example, like destroying a certain number of ships INSIDE the bay don't progress the story. And if you don't achieve full syncronization in that memory, you still get to see, and paricipate in, ALL of the story line in the real world when you finish each section of the story, unlike previous AC episodes where you had to have full syncronization everywhere in order to find all the symbols on buildings to unlock recordings. On the other hand you can consider this a good thing since for people who aren't good at these games, may find that having mandatory full syncronization extremely frustrating.\n- using rifles: since I obviously used the PC version (thank God, becuase i loath consoles) you sparingly use large fire-arms, and you may forget how to use them. By the way use 'E' to aim (at explosives or a specific enemy) and then use 'Q' to fire it. Consequently with your small fire-arm, you can just fire automatically with 'Q' as long as the enemy that you want to kill is highlighted (and press 'R' to reload any fire-arm) Similarly, you can fire your arrows in the same manner (no reload needed, obviously).\n- not so much a consequence if you've upgraded your ship: turning toward an enemy ship without a rudder upgrade will require quick thinking and good steering.\nPROS:\n- The Story is very enjoyable. From the beginning you start off slowly and it builds and builds until you reach a bitter-sweet climax (I have similar feelings for the DLC)\n- Without collecting resources and sending convoys to other cities, you are able to collect enough Pounds to fully upgrade your ship, and still have several thousand Pounds left over for bribes for example.\n- There are enough chests around after you finish the Epilogue missions for more ammunition, and a bit of cash if you feel like just going around and killing Regulars.\n- I found out that the people who complained about AC3, saying that AC4 is better for having ship missions, were lying through their teeth. The ship missions are very enjoyable, especially when you use different types of ammunition with the cannons.\nAnd the biggest positive aspect of the game: the real world missions. Ever since I played the previous games in the series i was hoping to God that they would give us missions with Desmond Miles. And by God they delivered!! The real world missions aren't overly complicated for non-gamers, but still fun. Let's hope in future games they give us an assassin story that is set in a modern city...\nAll in all, the positive things of the game out-weigh the small negative things.\nNow i'm off to hunt for the special edition with flags and other goodies!", "hours": 72.9, "username": "Johnny M", "products": 83, "early_access": false}

Mixed and confused feelings while playing AC3 made me realize i am maybe fan of series. I liked all old ACs - 1/2/Brotherhood/Revelations. I understand i was influenced by my \"AC-tour\" - i played AC1 years ago, now i played all of rest in a row - AC2/Brotherhood/Revelations and AC3. Without any gaps between them so i had really space to do (mostly unwanted) comparisons between games.\nPros:\n- beautiful environment, graphics, beautifuly changing weather between spring/summer/autumn to really snowy winter, where one can hardly walk in snow\n- few enhancements to stealth system, stealth is more fun than it was before\n- introduction to sea/navy fights, later enhanced and polished in ACIV:BF, also beautiful rendering of sea environment and gameplay on sea is really fun and has its strong atmosphere, much more than rest of the game\nCons:\n- dull and untrustable storytelling, jumps in story, not full continuity, sometimes very confusing storytelling\n- dull or somehow empty rendering of main character\n- really bad optimization for PC, one part of trouble is GPU optimization, second part is CPU optimization, this game is stupidly power hungry for no reason\n- overall such buggy and glitchy game, huge leap from almost unbugged/unglitched previous versions of AC\n- new main character Connor is just killing machine with stupid auto-heal function from FPS games\n- first FIVE sequences as tutorial and so called \"growing\" of your charater was really bad\n- horses are back again :( - i was glad after Rome in Brotherhood there are no horses in Revelations, it just brings gameplay troubles. Horses can't go everywhere, of course, but what was worst during \"tutorial\" sequences your only chance to get horse is to get it in some willage. Later in game you will get horse-whistle, so you can call \"your\" horse anytime as it was in Brotherhood. But until then you will spend a lot of walking in deeps now in middle of nowhere etc., it was very annoying\n- one of stupidiest thing for me - you play as native American, people, who whisper with horses and listen to Mother Earth and you are literally pushed to use only as few arrows in your quiver? Like as you are unable to catch a rabbit (and they are plenty in game) and just make an large quiver almost instantly? Same with other tools/pouches etc.\nPlaying AC3 and then AC4:BF made me realize that AC itself looks dead. Storyline of world of Assassins and Templars looks exhausted.

I finished 1 and 2, I'm about 50% through Brotherhood. I got Assassins Creed 3 from a friend for Christmas last year, and just got around to playing it this last weekend.\nI really can't recommend this title. The characters are not well rounded, one inparticular flitting from Niave young man eager to please his mentor, to mustache twirling sociopath in the space of 2 cutscenes. There is a really nice twist in the game that happened much too early that takes you away from a somewhat sympathetic character and sticks you with a total moron, who is much too niave given the fact that he stabs people in the throat for a living. And Seriously, I can't stress this enough, a character goes from wanting to be initiated into a club of friends, and waiting on their every need like a good little boy, TO STRANGLING A CHILD... in 2 concurrent cutscenes.\nThe combat is fun. The counter system is good, you go from kill to kill competently. It seems to focus more on counters and timing, so you have to get into the rhythm of things in order to do well. Once you wrap your head around it, it can be rewarding to cut through a squad of guys and the 45 backup dudes that dogpile you. This is the first Assassin's Creed game where I saw a reason to Run. Guards pose a legitimate threat. The ship minigame is fun too.\nCollectables and missions wise, there is some good variety, and I found myself enjoying finding collectables, or chasing down sheets of paper, or beating up tax collectors... It's all rather fun. You get real rewards for all of it that apply back to your purchasing power and the combat makes them worth while (Though again, because of the threat of guards you do have to take a moment's pause to consider how to do something).\nConclusion: I harped a lot on the story a bit ago, because despite the controls and missions being competent, this is an Assassin's Creed game, and thus it's pretty similar to stuff we've seen before. I would write the last two paragraphs about any of the other games. What draws me between the games is the storyline of the game, because that is all that is unique to each game.

The first game, starts with a beautiful, well-orchestrated, intriguing and delightful sequence, which takes you from the Opera to the colonies, following the game\u2019s most interesting character: Haytham Kenway. During these first sequences, you control a character with, well, character. The feeling of the age is given very nicely and the world-wise and confident Haytham is a good match to anyone who has played the AC series. It pauses at the end of sequence 4, after having skillfully introduced the next character, to give way to the second game.\nThe second game, which gives you lots of things to do and follows the life of Connor, and his tutelage and eventual success at stopping the Templars, has the unfortunate feeling of being somewhat disconnected. There is lots to do, from trapping animals to fighting naval battles, from trading to building up the homestead, all the time collecting \u201cenergy sources\u201d in present day to power up \u201cthe temple\u201d and see what there is. The problem with all of this is that you control a character that starts, justifiably, na\u00efve but does not develop into what you hope and falls way short of his far more interesting father. Surrounded by the most ridiculous rendition of naval warfare, the proverbially stupid guards and a background story that has lost all track, the game goes on to the very end with just a bit too much to do and a bit too little to say.\nIronically, AC III\u2019s top two moments are probably after its main story is done, with Connor\u2019s meeting with the old man in his village, and the criticism on the days after the American revolution, on how to make money by selling land you don\u2019t own, and on how there is little difference over who rules.\nAC III is by no means a bad game. It has improved in all technical areas and the things you can do are really enjoyable and mostly well executed. As always, guards could be more intelligent, to add realism and depth to the game and bullets should kill you but, those things aside, the game delivers well in most areas \u2013 it is just a bit all over the place story-wise.", "hours": 88.2, "user_id": "76561198057575998", "username": "Pandelis", "products": 37, "early_access": false}

I was kinda sorta wrong.\nFirst off, the free-running takes a bit of getting used to, as the buttons to do so are different. There aren't as many handholds as previous games, but AC 3 compensates by making it so that you can leap farther side to side or up to reach a new handhold.\nThe largest problem I had when I started this game was the combat mechanics. At first I had no idea what to do, and got hit quite often. Although there is something similar to the combo insta-kill thing in the trilogy, it's not quite the same here. Again, as well as the buttons being different, it's not always a one-hit kill. Sometimes you have to keep going at your opponent until he dies. Also, the use of guns in this game is much more advanced than in previous games (obviously). The aiming/lockon system is slightly different, but you'll get used to it quick enough. Choosing exactly who to shoot without relying on the games auto-aim thing is a nice feature as well.\nThe plot line so far is ok, not really interesting but I've always been a movie person, so I do watch the cutscenes and so on. If you don't like the cinematic portion of games, then just skip it shoot people, I guess.\nI do enjoy the more open maps I have to explore, especially in the wilderness. The size is ok, but the details are definitely on par to what I expected. The city of Boston is also an interesting place to freerun around, and the changing seasons make the settings intriguing as well.\nThat's all I have to say about it for now.

Not only is this tideous and makes nerve reckly diffecult on your nerves as you have to restart alot, its time consuming, and takes you out of the immersion of the game while eerily being hand held at the same time.\nThe most annoying is sometimes a wall will be by a bush and it will auto cover when you're trying to stealth kill, or visa versa.\nDesmond huh such a generic character. If you're going to have us crashing at least make Desmond show suffering so it actually feels like it affects his memory. I didn't like the fact that I just couldn't play with the main character Conner.  Perhaps its to introduce his background. But we are already in a background to background story here. I wanted to learn way more about the main protoganist. His father could have been a seperate dlc. This could have given Conner the better story arc that I feel sort of lacking.  I still recommend this game, because what game is perfect. Let's just hope Unity and Rogue (hopefully comes to pc) have fixed these bugs and implement a beter stealth/ combat system.", "hours": 28.6, "user_id": "76561198009420039", "username": "JonnyRenegade", "products": 501, "early_access": false}

Set during the American Revolution 1753-1783 Assassin's Creed III follows the centuries old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control.\nAC III is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783, and it also follows Desmond Miles's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain freedom in the colonies.\nAssassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Assassin's Creed III now features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the Aquila, the player can now navigate the high seas. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storm's, high waves, and rocks. Free running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc.\nStealth is also revamped, allowing Connor to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people. Assassin's Creed III really is a vast improvement over the other games in the series. While continuing the excellent story line. This game is full of amazing detail in every aspect; Story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and more.\nI really recommend this for the mere fact that it is always fun to play, and there's just so much to do in it improvement as it now features loads of new content while still retaining features from the previous games. I really cannot recommend this game enough it is just absolutely outstanding.

Unfortunately, whereas AC2 was a masterpiece of a game, this game just doesn't live up to that high point in the series.\nThere are a few good points, the fighting system allows you to do more things, Connor has a few new toys to play with compared with Ezio, and the naval combat is interesting. Desmond in the present finally learned how to fight (I think that playing as Desmond in the present working to stop the templars would have been much more interesting for AC3 than trying to introduce a new character after Ezio).\nUnfortunately, this game also has a lot of negatives.\nFirst off, the introduction is very slow. You play as a different character for the first few HOURS before you even get to Connor. I'm also not sure that the American revolution was the best setting for an AC game since the cities just aren't really that interesting and the frontier, while fun to explore, looks like it belongs in a different game. The story with Desmond in the present is unsatisfying and boring with a cop-out ending.\nBecause of this, this game has the opposite problem of most games in that it feels almost TOO long. Granted, I'm a completionist for these types of games and by the end it was just tedious trying to get everything.\nThen there's the bugs. This is by far the buggiest AC game in the series.

(I could keep going, but don't want to spoil it for you)...\nStory wise the game gives you the opportunity to play more as Desmond, you will do some missions with him; and as far as playing with Connor, unlike with the other two Assassins (Ezio and Altair) he is a weird and not as interesting character you might think, or at least that's what I thought while playing it.\nThe music and the soundtrack overall is quite good, even though when they are like improved versions of some of the songs from previous games.\nMultiplayer mode is pretty good compared to the other versions of the game as it keeps the modes from the previous and add some more to it. Matchmaking is fairly quick and you will find yourself playing without of waiting. Almost if not all of the modes reward your play style rather than the number of kills or deaths you have, in other words \"the sneakier you are, the better score you will get\".\nWhile this game has a lot of improvements over the previous installments it is poorly optimized for PC and even if you have the latest hardware you will find your computer struggling to get stable FPS in some portions of the game. Of course, there are quite a few of work-around solutions to have the game as playable but, among all the possible solutions you need to find the one for your needs; strangely enough the performance issue is mainly in the Single player portion of the game as the multiplayer runs smoothly.\nOverall, I had a blast while playing both the single and multiplayer modes, if you like the Assassin's Creed series, this is going to be a good game for you, so if you don't have it yet... well, I don't know what are you waiting for? get that hidden blade ready and get it now...", "hours": 80.8, "username": ".: D :.", "products": 227, "early_access": false}

The writing is sloppy, and the game design atrocious. There's a ton of things to do, like hunting, improving your ship, collecting Ben Franklin's missing almanac pages to get some of his inventions as trophies. None of these things tie in to the game in the same way as, say, recruiting help in AC2 and it's two successors. In other words, there's absolutely no need to do any of this stuff, and since the rewards are non-existent gamewise, one soon loses interest in anything else than the main storyline.\nAlso, the game is quite bad in explaining things. You can fast travel between the main story line missions, but I found this out after treading through the frontier forests time and again, adding a few hours of aimless wandering in forests that are designed to block your way instead of making the advancement fun. The cities are boring, and I left about 80 % of everything undiscovered. Lack of interest. There are some very poorly designed levels, and the whole frontierland is one big mess of mandatory jumping and climbing and \"oh, I have 2000 more meters to go, but my horse can't cross this river that is three meters wide\". Add to this some seriously sloppy coding (the same NPC brushing a horse AND standing by a cliff a few meters away AT THE SAME TIME) and AI (the guards not bothering to check the carts and haystacks, although on high alert), and you get a picture of what's wrong with the whole. Also, the few railed levels in present day only serve to alienate the player from the main story even further.\nThere's a lot of potential in AC3, but it's all wasted too easily.

I had to restart a single mission THIRTY times, just because of this and other glitches.\nGlitches aside, the story meanders, and fails to have a cohesive plot. The protagonist is railroaded into one story after another, clearly more to force the plot to carry you along with major historical events (riding the same horse as Paul Revere, for example) rather than writing a good story against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War. The developers clearly had a checklist of major and minor historical figures and events that they wanted to force you into meeting.\nThe voice acting of the main protagonist is dull. He has two tones: Grey, and loud. The writing is shoddy, with his emotional state seemingly random.\nThe mechanics are a bit haphazard as well. Hunting? It's never really made clear what that's for. Possibly for (near-pointless) crafting for (absolutely pointless) trading, and the occasional collection quest, but I have tons of materials in my pocket (because infinite pockets) that I'm never quite sure if I'm supposed to be selling or saving, so I've stuck with saving (and ultimately doing nothing with them).\nClimbing trees? Dangerous, not actually all that useful (since it slows you down). Same with buildings, at this point. Gone are the days of AC1 and AC2's free running being a transportation method. The roofs of buildings are often too mismatched or unconnected to ever be useful. It was so bad that even the developers realized they needed to shoehorn in an underground maze that unlocks fast travel points around the area, so you can quickly traverse the city without having to deal with actually playing the game to travel.\nThe maze you unlock fast travel with? Dull. It's atmospheric at first, but after spending 45 mind-numbing minutes exploring ever nook of it just to make sure I missed nothing (there was nothing to miss, only the fast travel points are down there), I now have absolutely no reason to visit it ever again, and regret spending so much time with it.\nSide missions? Most of them involve little to no plot. In fact, the vast majority involve finding four people in a city, and pushing a button/key while standing next to them. The most complicated the dialog gets is something like \"Thank you for delivering this\".\nI'm around half way through the game, and most of the time I spend playing it has me either rolling my eyes, yawning, or incredibly frustrated.\nI'm only playing it because I feel it's necessary to not miss part of the over-arching story. I read books. I *own* books (enough to fill two seven-foot-tall bookshelves). I've been reading my whole life, and sci-fi/fantasy stories are my bread and butter. I can't *not* finish this game before moving on to the (reportedly better) AC4, but I'm NOT enjoying the experience.\nThe first time I started playing it, I spent 19 hours with it before I gave up. It's the first PC AC game I didn't play through to the end. I'm back now a year and a half later, playing it again, just so I can finish it and move on to the reportedly much better AC4. I'm 48% of the way through, and wish it was already over.\nIf you're not like me, and can stand to skip this bit of the story (or are willing to let someone else spoil it for you), do not buy this game. If you DO need to buy this game, I recommend spending as little money as possible.", "hours": 52.1, "username": "Moleculor", "products": 684, "early_access": false}

The cities where just plain boring with very little places that were exciting to climb, and moving from one point to another felt like a chore instead of a navigational puzzle. The nature climbing and frontier aspects (while good ideas) where simply too twitchy to work effectively. The combat fell underneath the trap of the first AC where it was too repetitive and slow paced, and the gadgets I just couldn't really find a use for. Sure I figured them out easily enough, but I found the game to be much more efficient simply not using them. The highlight was the naval battles, since they were such an original concept, and they did manage to maintain their fun throughout the game as well.\nFor the more abstract aspects, I felt the story was confusing and not at all properly injected into the history of the Revolutionary war.

There is no real need to craft anything if you just want to complete the story, you can complete all the chapters with the bare minimum effort being put in.\nThe length of the game is very good, I only finished the main story and this took me twenty four hours. My actual completion rate is about 30% according to the statistics page, so you can probably ramp up about fifty hours of game play in total if you wanted to do all the side missions and challenges.\nGraphics wise, looks really nice.

I would still recommend this game for anyone who classes them selves as a gamer at heart especially for the price that it's at now, even when not on sale, you are getting a bargain at \u00a314,99.\nMore reviews at -", "hours": 24.4, "username": "Tom", "products": 2956, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "208480", "page": 313, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-07-31", "text": "This is probably my favourite assassin's creed game so far (I haven't played Black Flag yet though).\nThe combat is pretty nice (although, not much different from earlier games). The counter system has been changed, and now gives you the option of throwing/disarming/killing your opponent with either primary or secondary weapons; but the enemy types remain roughly the same.\nThere are now more stealth opportunities, with the ability to move through dense undergrowth undetected, and some of the optional (and main) missions reflect this. There's still no option to stealthily move around normally though.\nCalling for support has also been changed, with a range of different options instead of just being able to call for a target to be assassinated or support in a fight. Some of them feel like they need a bit more work, particularly ambushes and the fake guards thing. Ambushes are slightly irritating in the rather long time between them being triggered and something actually happening (although, this also happens with the standard assassination and marksman skills, but I tended to use them in less time sensitive ways). Fake guards can spawn either colonial or redcoat disguises, but there's no way to specify which, so you have to hope for the right one.\nMoney is slightly problematic in the game. You no longer recieve any money for completing missions, but there's also very little to spend money on. The (dyed) outfits may be worth spending money on, and the maps are handy, but the better weapons can be crafted for less money (and there doesn't seem to be much difference between different swords etc. Pistols are a little more noticeable in their differences, since some fire multiple shots at a time and some can be fired twice without reloading). The ship upgrades are largely worthwhile, but the naval missions aren't really particularly important in the game so it seems a little dissapointing only spending money on upgrading the ship.\nThe naval missions are damn fun though. The difficulty of them seems a little easy though, since the Aquila appears to be nearly indestructible compared to the enemy ships. A lot of the optional missions make it seem like controlling it should be harder, with stuff like \"25% or less damage from hitting rocks\" appearing a couple of times.\nMost of the optional missions are pretty well chosen, adding some difficulty without being too annoying. There are a few exceptions, like when you have chase someone down busy streets without hitting anybody.\nThe Tyranny of King Washington is damn fun too, with the animal spirit powers modifying the gameplay style a bit. I would recommend playing the standard game first, since there are no tutorials for anything other than the spirit powers (and the control system is fairly different), and the collectibles do include spoilers for the main game (including the ending of the game). My main problem with it is that you have to find additional weapons in treasure chests, and you're never given the opportunity of deciding to keep what you already have equipped rather than what's in the chest.\nThere are problems with the game however. It's quite buggy. Some of the bugs may be due to me playing the game on a laptop that's a little below the minimum specs (although the game largely ran fine for me).\nThe most noticeable is that dyed outfits don't show up in cutscenes, and instead you always wear assassin white clothes (the unlockable outfits do work though). Sometimes, weapons mysteriously unequip and have to be re-equipped (this mostly happened with Captain Kidd's sword for me, but I also lost a tomahawk during the Tyranny dlc). The magic lanterns in New York (and one of the Boston ones) were blank, leaving me to solve them based on brief flashes of the symbols during transitions from the top to the right slots and youtube videos. Changing weapons/outfits are the homestead is also ridiculously slow, with massive pauses between pressing the button to change to the next weapon and the actual change happening.\nCliff climbing is also introduced in this game, as well as free running through trees and the ability to quickly go over fences etc. instead of climbing onto them and jumping off them. These are all largely good, although it can be difficult to tell where a cliff can actually be climbed and where it's just slight bulges in the cliff. Tree free running is pretty good, particularly when it's been snowing, but there aren't really enough branches for them to actually go where you want (particularly when you're running around outside of missions).\nThe actual plot of the game is pretty good, but it suffers one problem: Conner comes across as quite dull. I'm not sure whether it's a problem with character being unlikeable or the monotonous voice acting though. As in this review, there's so much else going on that the plot feels more like another distraction than the main bulk of the game.\nAnd while, yes it is a game by Ubisoft and so it needs uplay to work, Uplay does seem to mostly keep out of your way. There's a little delay at launch while it loads, and it likes reminding you about the dashboard when you start the game, but otherwise it's pretty much invisible. Except when you complete an achievement/action. It does feel like it shouldn't really be needed though.\nTL;DR: Pretty good game, with a few problems.", "hours": 135.9, "username": "Morgan", "products": 149, "early_access": false}

The prologue was too long for me, the tree parkour was gimmicky, etc.\nOh was I wrong.\nPROS:\n~Excellent narrative. As usual in the Assassin's Creed series the story is outstanding with many twists and turns that leave the player interested. I think the modern day story was a little \"out-there\" in Assassin's Creed 3, but hey, you don't have to play much outside of the Animus.\n~Different ancestor. I think that having a Native American protagonist was really interesting, and added a lot to the story. Conflicts were coming from not just the Templars and Assassins, but now there is a father-son conflict, as well as a native-settler conflict.\n~Character development. Maybe I'm getting TOO in-depth here, but it is a strong point of a fantastic story. Connor grows very noticably as a character as he discovers new things about the Assassin's and what is happening to his tribe.\n~Beautiful Setting. 1770's Boston (the American Revolution in general, as you travel to other places like New York as well) was believably rendered in AC3. People are getting shaken down in the streets by tax collectors, redcoats are constantly patrolling the streets, and there are many historical figures to interact with (Ben Franklin, Samuel Adams, etc.).\n~New Mechanics. Tree parkour is not the gimmick I thought it was, and is actual very cool in the frontier missions, as well as hunting. There are also new tools like rope darts (I didn't get to use them much because I never stopped playing story missions to make the money for them) which add new takedowns if you're looking for a stealthier approach.\nCONS:\n~Counter killing is no longer your go-to strategy. If you're anything like me, you probably skated through combat in every other AC game by using counter kills and execute-chains. New enemies such as Hessians, Grenadiers, and officers will not accept your lazy combat, and will counter your counter. You now have to disarm them first and then attack them.\n~Not as many weapons as previous games. Heavy weapons, swords, small weapons, those sorts of things dpn't have as much variety as I'd like them too, and found myself running out of new ones around Sequence 7.\n~Frontier \"town\". You can recruit people to live in your little \"town\" per se. They can do some helpful things like craft double pistol holsters, but I generally found it cumbersome to go the the general store (there's also one in the estate I think) and go through the crafting menu and try new recipes and make stupid stuff like barrels and then ship them on trade routes.\n, but I personally did not.\nTL;DR:\nAssassin's Creed 3 is an incredible addition to the series story wise, and has really enjoyable gameplay. Despite a few minor personal dislikes, the game was very enjoyable.\n9/10\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nPretty much all of the cons were personal things I didn't like about the game. I never experienced any bugs, uPlay never gave me any trouble, and I played with a controller so there were no control problems. This is probably my personal favorite in the series and I put probably 10-15 hours in the first time I opened the game.", "hours": 26.5, "username": "mino", "products": 131, "early_access": false}

Now I\u2019ve always been a big fan of the Assassin\u2019s Creed series until around Revelations when I noticed that Ubisoft just seems to have stopped caring.\nI started Assassin\u2019s Creed 3 thinking, \u201cOh hey. This guy seems pretty interesting, this psychopathic, and relentless British murderer. He\u2019s not quite Ezio but let\u2019s see where it goes.\u201d After three games of Ezio, a change of pace is well received. Presumably this character is just for the introduction sequence, which is a shame really. \u2026A very long introduction sequence. Honestly, the game doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s started until you\u2019re on around act six, and with only twelve or so acts, that\u2019s a great chunk of time dedicated to just getting through the freaking tutorial stages.\nConnor is a fairly boring and flat protagonist. He lacks the attitude of Altair, and the charisma of Ezio. This new protagonist brings zero personality to the table, his own father Haytham possessing far more charm and wit, as murderously cold as it is.  Connor is like Desmond, only he doesn\u2019t swear, so not only do we have a protagonist without a personality but he also lacks any edginess, because apparently using the word \u2018\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2019 over and over in gaming now makes your protagonist\u2019s \u2018edgy\u2019.\nThe free running is fine, maybe it would be better if every tree wasn\u2019t the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing same. But yeah, the free running is pretty standard for any Assassin\u2019s Creed game. Hunting is a fairly pointless addition. Aside from the hunting side-quests, all I had to do to successfully hunt was occasionally stab anything that ran out in-front of me. Sometimes an elk or deer would just get stuck in a tree and I\u2019d casually deliver the finishing blow.\nTrading and gathering money is pointless. Homestead missions don\u2019t feel immersive and contribute nothing to the greater whole of the story. Naval missions are one of the highlights as far as pointless side quests go, though the novelty wears off after the first three or four times you do it. Honestly, they could have made a separate game just for this- waaaait\u2026 they already did that with Assassin\u2019s Creed 4.\nMost of the \u2018villains\u2019 you defeat and kill as Connor isn\u2019t even \u2018that bad\u2019. Killing some of them leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but Connor never seems to express much concern in whether or not he\u2019s doing is right or wrong.\nBoston and New York look the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing same, minus some burned buildings. The underground parts are not only mind numbingly boring but absolutely pointless. There are a lot of additional features and quests in this game that you think would contribute more to your stabby stabby efforts, but they really don\u2019t and they\u2019re not very fun or rewarding either.\nStealth seems a lot more difficult than it was in previous games and by difficult I mean non-existent. I tried being stealthy in a lot of areas and it just never worked, leaving me to resort to my invincible assassin bad\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665routine. At times it felt more like playing batman arkham asylum.\nThe real life segments of the game are extremely rushed, and there\u2019s only one part worth watching where everyone\u2019s least favourite character receives a smack against his Adam Sandler mug. The mission where you kill Warren Vidic is extremely rushed, boring and doesn\u2019t allow for any character development whatsoever. It\u2019s extremely hard to sympathise with any characters at this point.\nI hope we don\u2019t see Connor in anymore games, and while this was okay, even Assassin\u2019s Creed 1 felt more concise in what it was trying to deliver. This by comparison is an assorted tired mess of a game.

In their words. Frankly, I was hoping to beat up Colonists in the British Army. I was disappointed by the fact that the game exhibits an anti-American and anti-European view, where the main plot involving Connor asks the question: At what cost is independence good?\nYou see the cost through the oppressive acts that the British conduct on the colonists and that both of them do on the African slaves and native Americans. You doubt Washington for what the game shows that he's done. You doubt the British, but you probably did anyway, especially if you're from the U.S., France, Germany, or inner London. You ask yourself, \"Is peace really going to come about because of freedom?\" And this is what Connor asks when he works with his father and the Templar Knights. Eventually he warps his idea of freedom into an idea of equality, where his goal is to remove oppression in America (he fails of course). Where the Assassin's ideal compared to the Templar's changes nothing. So Connor's own Order of Assassins is different, fighting the oppression that comes with ultimate control rather than the lack of freedom that comes with it.\nThe game is far too political, and in a direction that is largely irrelevant to the world situation in 2012. It shows anti-American and anti-European bias way too much.

To begin, the game's setting had a lot of potential to make it a great game. Unfortunately, Ubisoft neglected to realize that they set a game in one of America's most exciting times and didn't act upon the fact that there were two wars happening throughout the whole game. Even the freaking trailer shows a massive (fictional) battle taking place, so I wanted action. I went into this game during my first playthrough expecting an epic wartime adventure through early American history. I was sorely disappointed. Instead, I got a depressing character who speaks in a boring monotone and grunts \"Where's Charles Lee?\" every 5 minutes, and a mediocre story focusing mainly on the plight of Connor's people. We get it. It was a bad time to be a Native American. No need to spend a whole game telling us about this. I tried playing through this game a second time, this time with correct expectations. I now realize that this game isn't that horrible if I think about it. The graphics and character design were unique, the cities and all of their details were fantastic, even the modern day sections of the game were somewhat entertaining.

So many hours of my life have been sucked away by your mildly repetitious gameplay. Up to a point, every installation in Ubisoft's AC series is different -- enough to make me curious -- and yet the games themselves are really just the same thing dressed in a slightly different costume each time. At least, that's the general impression I get.\nFor the most part this remains the case with AC3, but the gameplay was slightly different. I've always been annoyed by some of the mechanics (namely the occasional attempted leap of faith to any number of strategically placed piles of hay which turns into a rather pathetic suicidal fail) but that could easily be attributed to my own lack of skill in the game. Most of the time I didn't have to worry about this in previous installments, so it wasn't bad enough for me to stop investing in the franchise.\nUnfortunately I spent a good deal of time in AC3 --in part due to a new control format for keyboards -- staring in dumb disbelief as the main character alternately jumped in the wrong direction and tripped over his own face.\nOnce again, maybe I just suck on an epic level at this game, but the smooth feeling of climbing and free-running from the past games felt a lot more faltering in this one.\nI will say that I'm very happy with the ending, and the ability to run through the trees and sail a ship was enjoyable. I really liked the guerilla tactics in the wilds, and the combat was fluid and enjoyable as always. The running through the trees was smooth enough to compensate for the awkwardness of the cities.\nThe story was a bit forced and there were several laughable plot points (how easily Connor obeys his main enemy, for one).\nDon't get me wrong -- I do like the series of games as a whole, and I highly recommend them. But this game was not a highlight, nor in my top three favorite AC games.\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the Assassin's Creed storyline and games, because it ties together some very important things, but my opinion of it isn't high enough for me to suggest it to anyone who didn't really, really like the previous games, or who isn't very interested by the story of Desmond Miles.\nI would recommend it to those who haven't played its predecessors, and those who have played them and liked them.", "hours": 20.3, "username": "Greyhark", "products": 141, "early_access": false}

I had played this game and was halfway done on the PS3 version, back in 2012... and somehow, I had lost interest on the game. Not because of the American Revolution War setting, but of many bugs, glitches, bland missions and irritating side missions. Honestly, AC3 is my least favorite game of the franchise. So many annoying aspects that kept this game to be just fun.\nWhile the game continues the story of Desmond Miles, I would say that if you had played previous AC games, you ought it to yourself to at least, play AC3 for the sake of Desmond's storyline. It is quite interesting to finally see it conclude in some way while being somehow predictable but frankly, it has finally the closure many fans demanded.\nAs for the Animus storyline, you play as a Native American, a Mohawk named Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, aka Connor. He's thrown into the assassin vs templar neverending war, without his conscent (like usual!). You see him growing up, learning how to be an assassin, mastering skills and whatnot. Some time further, you get to control your own sail ship. At least, this is a fun portion of the game! But alas, the good portions are very rare, on the experience I got while playing this game...\nPROS:\n+Graphically, this game is impressive, especially this PC version compared to PS3.\n+Amazing attention to historical and visual details (seeing Boston and New York of the old times was quite a virtual visit!).\n+Haytham Kenway (really liked that character and I wish we'd get to play some more of that character's faction in the future of AC games).\n+Rich storytelling.\n+Sea battles are indeed, very fun and tense!\n+Homestead missions and watching that Homestead come to life after each mission completed.\nCONS:\n-Uplay DRM.\n-LOTS bugs and glitches.\n-QTE. Not too abundant but still present nonetheless.\n-Terrible and Inflexible missions. You gotta play each missions as how the developer demands you do.\n-Checklist of optional objectives for some bullcrap of \"FULL SYNCHRONIZATION\". Besides achievements and Desmond Miles skin inside the Animus, it's not worth the trouble!\n-Assassin's recruits doesn't seem to level up as much and as fast as previous AC games.\n-Weak soundtrack done by Lorne Balfe. Worse was at many times, you don't hear any music at all which makes the game a snore fest.\n-Hunting mechanics go largely undeveloped and becomes pointless for the little gain you obtain from hunting.\n-Parkour inconsistencies. (Connor always seem to grip into everything... if only you'd had a button to trigger \"grip\" when running, that way, you wouldn't be grabbing every ledges and fences).\n-Stealth inconsistencies. (LOTS of stealth requirements on missions and if detected, DESYNCHRONIZED, REPEAT!).\n-As fun as the ship battles go, it becomes mostly pointless since you never obtain any rewards from them, no money, nothing!\n-Currency in the game is hard to obtain. I never understood the trading mechanic of the game and can't care at this point anyway.\n-Way too many tailing missions... just too many...\n-Limited replay value unless you seek Full Synch and all collectibles.\n-Same old multiplayer gameplay. Not my bag but maybe yours?\n-The Tyranny of King Washington DLC has a decent \"WHAT-IF\" scenario; it gives Connor cool \"animal spirit\" powers too. That DLC adds about 7 hours of gameplay, depending if you seek Full Synch that is! Although, it feels very strechted and doesn't add up anything into AC3 story. Ubisoft has mentioned that this DLC's story is canon but I fail to see on what base it is. You may skip that 7 or so hours and just read Wiki or watch gameplay videos instead!\nOVERALL:\nThe game felt rushed and overly streched in many parts. It was such a huge disappointment even if I dared investing around 40 hours into that iteration. Also, I do wonder if Ubisoft had tested that game and determined that, no, it is not fun to be whacked with a great big red X for failing the long and pointless checklist of optional objectives in missions. It just feels forced to play the game the way they have intended and you can't play the game otherwise, completely inflexible. AC3 is not mediocre but somehow, it is close to it. The game goes in both extremes very often. As good as the game can be at a time and as bad, annoying and irritating the next mission can be.\nIn all honesty, if my good old friend never told me how amazing Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is, I would have given up on the franchise, right here, after having played this AC3.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSomewhat, yes. For the sake of Desmond's final story arc mainly. If you do not care much about the modern story, you can always have some fun with Connor in the Animus and I gotta say, Connor's story is the saving grace of the whole game. Also, the Tyranny of King Washingtong DLC is passable and doesn't add anything to Connor's story, which makes the Season Pass very optional!

I will admit the story is definitely interesting, as different from the rest of the games. A few plot twists here and there, keep you wondering, what. Literally, if you are a big fan of the previous games in the series, you will understand after the Prologue missions.\nEvery part of the game has been revamp, including the game engine used. There is a brand new interface, which can be very confusing for the first few hours to an Assassin Creed Veteran of the previous games. But once you get a hang of it, combat can be fluid, quick, and outright awesome. I can\u2019t say as much for your assassin buddies, as Ubisoft has done away from customizing your recruits. And this is the first game of the series, where the line \u201cNothing is True, Everything is Permitted\u201d line. You are not bound by the creed of the assassin as much as in the previous games, but an assassin nonetheless.\nMovement is fluid, with the occasional wth moments, when your character jumps instead of slides under an obstacle, but that is done mainly through user error. Gunpowder plays a major role in this game, as you are no longer bound to only use Swords for most of the time, and can pick up enemy rifles, and pull out your own pistol(s). Can get dual pistols, when upgraded, and crafted.\nYou are also no longer bound by land, as you can now take to the sea\u2019s being the captain of your very own brig class French Warship. Not a man o war, but can still take one out if you know what you\u2019re doing. I will say, going on one of the very first missions as captain, jumping over heavy seas, in the middle of a big storm, bracing for big rogue waves, sure to destroy you if you are caught off guard. Definitely a great change of pace for the series, but the game has definitely changed, from the assassin perspective. Instead of assassinating targets, throughout the game you find yourself, chasing, and or following your targets. Stealth is quite hard in this game, as no matter where you hide, the AI just immediately know where you are. You end up spending most of the time playing with triangles, and trying to avoid them. Most of the time, you are in a brawl with most of your targets, taking them down with style, but not true of the Assassin Creed Series. You do more brawling, then actually assassinating.\nThe game is great, and is a must buy in the series. Many new things have been added, and changed. Though can be a turn off for some Assassin Creed Veterans, who have mastered the previous control schemes of the previous games. It is aesthetically pleasing graphic wise, though lip syncing outside of cut scenes is horrid, and clipping issues galore with the new fabric PhysX system in place. Story is definitely something to remember, especially to those, really wanting to know what happens in the life of Desmond Miles.", "hours": 33.6, "user_id": "76561198008241330", "username": "Petroph", "products": 251, "early_access": false}

Ubisoft have improved Assassin's Creed so much in third part that you don't have only 1 map to discover all of the feathers, and treasure chests, because in AC3 you have different kind of locations: New York, Boston, Homestead and Frontier.\nMany Assassin's Creed fan criticized that Ubisoft changed Ezio to Connor but I think it's a great thing if u want some change to AC-series and not that old repeating same city with a guy who's story is more well-known than your own pockets...\nIn AC3 you play as 3 different characters: Desmond Miles who is a 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Precursor Vault that purportedly will protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on December 21, 2012. To uncover the secrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of two of his ancestors which the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the American Revolutionary War. The first, briefly played at the start of the game, is Haytham Kenway, a British Templar that seeks the location of the Vault. The second, and the primary character for the game, is Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, the result of a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman. Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton takes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When playing as Connor, the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the Frontier, the cities of Boston and New York. Portions of the Eastern Seaboard and Caribbean Sea can be explored via the flagship of the Assassin's navy, the Aquila, captained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate advising and teaching him in the ways of the sea.\nBut no more of that... In my opinion Assassin's Creed 3 is the best in the whole AC-Series and even Black Flag won't be able to beat this game...

You play as Connor Kenway; a native American who trains to be an assassin in order to get revenge for his mother's death. You also play as his father, Haytham Kenway, at the start. Along the way you, Connor, ignite the fires of the American revolution and decide to help them purely because the Templars are helping the British. This entire idea feels pointless though because the patriots and Washington decide to burn your village so at the end you turn on them, whilst you see Templars killing royalists. Yeah Connor messed up...\nThe game introduces a new mechanic to its free running in the frontier sections, with the ability to climb trees and use these instead of rooftops. This is great and well executed but feels limiting, very streamlined, and is pointless seeing as most of the time nothing happens in the frontier. The rooftop free running is still there however guards detect you almost instantly and it kin  of discourages going on the roof, meaning you spend most time on the ground. This feels wrong for an assassin game, even more so with the fact you stand out wearing the assassins robes; at least Altair could hide among priests. The combat is great however after a while it feels repetitive as guards do the same moves, whether patriot or royalist, whether highlander or officer. Also you are so overpowered in this episode of the assassin's creed franchise.\nThe story is quite interesting and very in depth however Connor has no emotion or charm like the other assassins. He is quite plain, particularly when compared to his father who plays the relaxed aristocrat. In addition, every time you get somewhere good in the story Desmond shows his face and you have to endure half an hour of modern day pointless Desmond. The ending is boring and the credits last 20 mins, you can't even skip them. The beginning isn't great either, with a long tutorial, it takes about 5 hours before you even get the assassin robes. The lockpicking system is horrible (just copy Skyrim for goodness sake) and overall the game feels clunky and rushed; particularly the anti-climatic battles.\nHowever, as a history buff and a fan of the colonial era I felt at home with the game. I did get annoyed with the historical inaccuracies (there are a lot) however there were a few nods to people such as myself within the story. I felt as though the story itself was good, it was fun to go on killstreaks, the naval combat wasn't too bad and the graphics lived up to their standard. The seasonal and time changes were a joy and it was nice to see so much content; the hunting is an example of this, it had a lot of content but really was just pointless.\nOverall I enjoyed AC 3 however I feel as though the game is only enjoyable to people who appreciate the era and who don't over hype it.\n6/10.", "hours": 256.5, "username": "\u2629\u265aSkipper\u2122\u265a\u2629", "products": 102, "early_access": false}

It's presentation is good, the \"parkour at nature\" mechanic and the naval battles (provided you didn't play Black Flag, which improved a lot on it) are very fun and incredibily good. Connor, though a bit taciturn, in my opinion is a very good character with a deep and emotional story. His father, Haytham, Achilles, Charles Lee and the others are excellent characters as well.\nThe story, for those like me that don't know much about the american revolution, feels quite confusing at times. It's hard to follow how the war is going, since Connor takes part on it only at a few times. Even with that, the characters shine and the story that goes around Connor is very good, and worth the time. The sidequests are plenty and mostly fun, with highlights to the frontiersman line and the animal hunting parts. One problem with the sidequests is that they were too secondary, in my opinion. I didn't do many things until right before the end of the game simply because the main storyline gave me few to no leads to follow on to procced onto the sidequests. It requires initiative to go through them all.\nSo, although the main character's personality might feel overshadowed by Ezio's charisma, the overall storyline of the world being a bit confusing and many sidequests being too detached from the main storyline for my tastes, excellent characters, very good new mechanics, very good plot and some shining sidequests make this game worth it.", "hours": 53.5, "username": "Heenett", "products": 200, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 325, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-07-03", "text": "TL;DR at the bottom\nI think the best way to review this game is to breifly touch on the other series and how I felt about them. I played through AC2 AC:B and AC:R. By the time I got to AC:R it felt like a chore, like homework, like pulling teeth to finish the game. It felt like recycled content, sure it was a different place, different story, but it really felt like a \"heres a third game to wrap it, its literally just tying loose ends\" kinda game.\nSo when a friend gifted me AC3 I was a little excited, and a little nervous. This game got mixed reviews, and I was still feeling the pressing boredom of AC:R invading my every AC related thought, despite it being a year or two since my last AC adventure.\nIm happy to say, this game is a refreshing experience. Its not as game changing as, say, AC2 to AC1, but there are alot of changes to gameplay that make the game refreshing.\nFirst and foremost, I love history, and wandering around colonial America was really stroking my nerddom. You get to meet Franklin, and other important colonial figures. The setting is awesome. You can wander two major cities, and explore the \"frontier\" and there is tons to do.\nThe story is pretty good also, you get to play as a Native American assassin, participating in many key battles in history, helping the americans gain independence. You grow to care about the charecter, (even if he is more bland than Ezio) and care about his story.\nThe combat is by and large the same as the previous renditions of AC's, however enemies seem to be slightly tougher than before, sometimes countering your gaurd break or smashing through your counter. They arn't hard to kill, but its fair to say that they are harder than previous AC enemies.\nDid I mention theres tons of stuff to do? You can sail, which I found slightly clunky, but a ton of fun. You can upgrade your ship, board ships, assault forts from the sea. The best part is that its not even mandetory save for a quest or two. You can either ignore it completely or do the mulitple sailing sidequests.\nIn addition to sailing, you can upgrade your base area, which often leads to quests that are more interesting than the main quest. You can hunt, you can brawl, you can trade for furs, craft. There is ALOT of content in this game.\nDesmonds stuff is pretty brief, but actually interested me enough to do the optional stuff with him. His story wraps up in this game, and although the desmond part of AC is often a lowlight, I was pretty enthralled by his part in this game.\nNow for the Negative aspects:\nThe main charecter is interesting, but his voice actor and his facial expressions make his personality fall flat (you'l know what I mean if you play the game to completion). He seems to lack emotions other than anger. While not a huge deal, as I find him interesting, his flat personality can sometimes ruin good moments in the game.\nScaling walls and some missions are largely left unchanged. Tailing missions are still present, (although I don't really mind them) and scaling down walls is still awful. Latching onto walls as you run past them while chasing or just trying to get to your destination faster are still a problem.\nThis game is fantastic. Its hard to say which is my favourite AC now, but I think 3 might just be awesome enough to take first place. This game (which I have seen as low as 10$ on steam) will give you AT LEAST 15 hours of gameplay. 30 if you do some side quests, which is well worth the cost. It gives alot of background on history (albeit warped to integrate your charecter) and pays great attention to detail (See painting in my screenshot section).\nTL;DR\nThis game is great, buy it. Hours of fun. If you like AC, buy it. If you like history, buy it. If you didn't like the previous iterations of AC, the changes brought into this game while are not significanly gamechanging, vary the gameplay enough to make it worth giving the series another shot.\nBuy it.", "hours": 31.4, "user_id": "76561198044202392", "username": "Klown", "products": 132, "early_access": false}

In the first FOUR hours before ever getting to play as the actual protagonist, I had to re-do and re-do and re-do again mission after mission because of absolutely awful design. The game wants you to do something exceptionally specific, go this way, duck behind this thing at the right time...without ever giving you any kind of clue as to what it actually wants you to do. Sometimes you'll be trying to sneak through a mission, failing every time, before finding out that anyone else who ever succeeded at that mission did it by bludgeoning their way through and making a great big scene--you know, just like a real assassin. Then when it INSISTS you be sneaky, it expects you to believe your sneakiness when you, a man dressed to the hilt in 18th century regal garmentry, are creeping around in 2 foot high, scraggly weeds, and that no one can see you, while simultaneously punishing you for doing things you think are sneaky, like climbing a ladder when some dude's back is turned. How can he not see me right next to him in the semblence of shrubbery, but when his back is turned, he catches me going up the ladder. In four hours, I must have re-done missions thirty times, and when I finally succeeded, I didn't feel like I'd accomplished anything but to trick the game somehow. This is NOT. FUN. Not in the slightest.\nAside from the abysmal mission design (there's a great big green circle in your minimap which is, oh, twice as large as the minimap itself, and you've just got to find some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in the snow, which by the way you have to trudge through slowly, like an imbecile--finding her isn't the result of good detective work, it's dumb luck), you have to acknowledge that the colonial days of America don't make for great free-running. The first AC made you feel out of place when you were climbing and running atop buildings--it felt like a real scene when you were free-running away from a kill. Nowadays they just want to show off their climbing physics so you're placed at the start of a mission all the way on the other side of town. Charles Lee, I'll meet you at the waterfront, you know, where we just were at the end of the last mission. It insists that you have a blast running and jumping your way there. But unlike the congested streets of Jerusalem or Florence, buildings are far apart, boxily shaped, and separated by wide streets--there's no point in climbing a building to run across roof tops because, apart from being an ugly, unconvincing, awkward experience where you can get caught on corners and nothing really seems to have been designed to be run upon, you will simply have to dive back down into the street after only a few houses are behind you.\nI wanted to like this game. I really, really, really wanted to like it. I loved the first two. After years of waiting, years of hearing people say good and bad things about it, I finally got it during the Summer Sale to try for myself, and what I have found was a game that defiantly did not want any love from me. I was so excited for the story, and I really liked the characters, but god almighty this game is just not good. I have Brotherhood in my library, a game universally praised, but I don't even want to play it anymore because this put such a bad taste in my mouth. It will be a while before I give AC another chance. I just need to flush this anger out of my system.\nDo. Not.

I enjoyed all 3 games immensely & would highly recommend anyone who haven't played AC to go buy these 3 games right now & play them back to back, they are so good!\nNEW REVIEW:\nIn summary: this is a great game & a must play for all AC fans.\nAfter spending almost 70 hours doing almost everything in the game possible, I have concluded that this is a really great game. Connor is a great character, the setting & story is good overall, the combat is brutal & I ended the game feeling satisfied with what I have achieved.\nHowever, I'd like to give some advice on how to get full enjoyment for this game.\nFirst, bulldoze through the first 5 sequences of the game till you get to the fun part - Connor. The first 5 sequence serves as tutorial missions, there's a lot of hand holding & forcing you to play a certain way. It was NOT FUN at all. This was what made me gave up on the game earlier on. It's gonna take you about 4-6 hours to do it.\nSecond, don't obsess over the optional objectives. If you do, it will SERIOUSLY LIMIT your fun & the tools & abilities given to you to complete the quests. You can challenge yourself, but don't fret if you don't 100% the optional objectives.\nThird, do the Homestead missions. These quests really flesh out Connor's character which you won't see during the main game storyline. It will give you more weight & depth to your actions in the story.\nFourth, play each sequence in one long sitting. Some sequences actually takes place within a very short timeframe (like a battle) & it was weird if you'd skip out of battle to do some hunting or collecting trinkets or go sail the seven seas. Do those things, the Homestead missions, crafting, whatever that you want to do, in between the sequences.\nFifth, collect all the Feathers earlier on & wear the Indian outfit throughout the game. Makes the struggle Connor go through in this game feels more real. At least that's how I feel.\nIf you're thinking of getting this game, DO IT. But put some time into it, it's worth it in the end.\nOLD REVIEW:\nI can't say the same thing for AC 3. I was so pumped after finishing AC: Revelations that I immediately went and bought AC3, expecting the same high quality gameplay, missions, & storyline of AC2 Trilogy. So far it's been a huge disappointment. The parkour running over the rooftops of a city has been neutered because the houses in AC3 is too far apart, the combat is sooo confusing, the prompts for cover is small & unclear, plus a bunch of other things. The control that was perfect was changed to accomodate ... WHAT EXACTLY!? It was perfect before! I was just boreeed out of my mind in the first few hours of the game and just switched off to play another game.\nI'll get to a point where I will finish this game for the story, but if you're looking for your first AC experience, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!", "hours": 80.5, "username": "jayen", "products": 504, "early_access": false}

This AC3 is completely the oppossite.\nStarting off with Connor. Ok, his motivations are legit, his skills are ducking awesome and all of that but... Wow, he lacks charisma. This guy is mad with everyone for no reason at all. He's completely flat. The worst main character in the saga.\nFor some reason the story doesn't really start until you spend like 1.5 hours (or 2 if you like to explore things and stuff as I like). And man... What a terrible story. It's the perfect scenario, they had a lot of ways to make a good and epic story but it's... Flat. Like Connor.\nThe story fails to hook up. Even tho secondary missions are... Meeeeh.\nHonorable mention to the tech side of the game: disapperaing corpses, strange physics, bugged missions in which the game doesn't recognize you met the objectives (forcing you to restart the mission), and a bunch of things more. I feel like the stealth part of the game is kinda missing. I feel like I can't kill someone without being detected. And man, you don't want them to see you, cause I don't know why, soldiers appear out of nothing! You killed a 4-soldier squad here cause you realized there were no more guards surrounding the zone? FALSE. They keep appearing from nowhere. They didn't appear in the minimap, \"Pouf\" and they're trying to stab you in the back.\nI simply don't feel like playing this game...\nOn the other hand, there are a few new things i find interesting (cause not everything is bad... but almost everything). The new climbing moves are pretty amazing. It's super cool to run from tree to tree and all of that. Naval fights are awesome. Hunting missions are simply a great addition to the saga, in the end it doesn't worth and sometimes is pretty annoying cause you can't even run without being attacked by wolves, lynx, mooses or bears, but it's a great addition no matter what.\nIn conclussion, the game is just... Average. It's not a good successor form AC in general, and Connor is the worst main character in the saga.\nIf you're a huge fan... Well, maybe you'll find it interesting.

I've played every Assassin's Creed game up to 3, and 3, without a doubt, is the worst of the series.

The Frontier was indeed a big, open, spacious area you could explore... That really had nothing in it. All in all, the game just felt... Bad. Not hideously disfigured or anything, but just not good.\nI liked the story, but at the same time, it felt like it dragged on and on needlessly, and was full of anticlimactic drabble or plot holes. I liked how the team displayed America. It's the America you don't really learn about in middle school/high school, and only get familiarized with in those few American History college courses you probably won't even bother to take. It's real to what actually happened, yet it isn't. It's hard to really explain, aside from It's accurate yet inaccurate at the same time. It's a \"Let's hate America\" story with the way that it's depicted, in such a regard as to be overzealous about driving that point home, meaning that, while it was historically accurate, they also intentionally made it very clear to depict the US as an evil tyrannical force.\nThe gameplay mechanics were honestly an improvement over previous Assassin's Creed titles, but were also difficult to get used to at first. Everything felt a lot faster-paced. To top it off, the transition from Hatham to Connor did not help matters, since the combat mechanics felt so different. Also, this game has one of the longest introductions to the Assassins ever (Which I know, there aren't many games to choose from in that regard, but still). You'll be spending the better part of 6 sequences just getting to the point where you finally put on the robes. And the robes themself were fairly poor in quality and design compared to previous games.

Sometimes it's just easier to kill 40 people than it is to jump to the branch you'd like to.\nThe good\nThe naval side of this series is fantastic and a major standout.\nIt looks very pretty.\nThe scale is enormous.\nThe Bad\nThe controls are more miss than hit.\nMonotonous missions.\nPacing is way off.\nThe scale is too enormous to have to travel on foot.\nThe movement needs a big tune up as traversing the landscape can be infuriating.\nI've found the story fairly lacking, the boat stuff is great but carrying a sick person hundreds of metres to a tent is not. Especially when it then ask you to do the video gaming rule of threes and find 2 more sick people to carry slowly around town to finish the mission. This leads into the pacing, which overall is quite slow.\nSometimes you'll start a mission, the objective is to reach the marker which is 500m away. This takes some time on foot, and ovce you get there, you'll get another briefing and have to travel another 500m. Usually this happens with a mission area limiting your freedom, so be prepared to blow large chunks of time climbing large cliffs, swimming or wading through snow only because you're forced too.\nThis is even worse when the checkpoint you go back to makes you run and climb all that way again. I found I simply couldn't be bothered. The movement isn't either interesting or working well enough to be the objective unless it's an early tutorial mission, While fast travel exists, it's only available in a few instances.\nOn top of that bugs bugs bugs. You will find yourself at a point where you've almost finished a mission, wiped out everybody but the boss and your attack button stops working. I watched helplessly as my allies all died to a single remaining enemy, then failed the mission. Quite a few niggles in this game force you to load your last checkpoint to proceed.\nI'm about 50% of the way through this one so far, I'd like to see the end but it all feels broken enough to take me out of it, I think it's time to put the control down. I've resorted to taking an entire fort head on and killing everyone inside, it's way easier than wrestling the controls to sneak around.\n5/10", "hours": 24.9, "user_id": "76561197972876249", "username": "Kd", "products": 80, "early_access": false}

HOWEVER, due to technical faults (which I could not solve) I couldn't play the game without Uplay crashing and burning it. Ubisoft customer support were very quick about replying however, but we still didn't solve the issue.  Eventually, I had to do a COMPUTER RESET BACK TO FACTORY SETTINGS just to get it to work. Once this was dealt with, the game worked perfectly.\nSo the game. You start the game off as Haytham Kenway. A suity kinda guy who you would definitely NOT expect to be climbing CInema walls.  And yet this is what he does. He climbs cinema walls just to kill a dude with a necklace. There is then set a wild goose chase, as we try and see if we can find some kinda temple or other.\nYou then play as Connor ( or Rahetuhaskjdbnjksbd apologies for bad spelling :D) who is a kid. You then play hide and seek with other kids and then get caught. Connor grows up really quickly to the point of being a tree hugger and climbing through trees. You meet an old guy on a hill. He turns out to be aan assassin and all that crap.\nOverall, I think this game is amazing. The graphics in-game are a stunning HD, and with my Nvidia GeForce Graphics chip, the game runs pretty smoothly. The fighting system works well, as you can easily block enemy attacks. Combo moves  are a bit tricky, but once you get the hang of it becomes great. The map is extremely big, covering New York, Boston, Davenport Homestead, and the jungle wilds. There are a few side quests, but if you get bored it may be worth getting the DLC addon. I would give this game a 9.5/10.

Assassin's Creed III is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed: Revelations.\nDesmond has regained his conscious and is now back in action. Desmond, Rebecca, Shaun and now his father, have traveled to the Grand Temple of \"Those Who Came Before\", an ancient race of powerful beings who created humankind before a global calamity thousands of years before the events of the game made them almost extinct and ravaged the Earth. There, Desmond needs to uncover how to open the secrets in the temple, but on his arrival, Desmond then falls into a fugue state, to which Desmond is returned to the Animus and bleeds back to Haytham Kenway.\nAssassin's Creed III has many major overhaul on the gameplay, some might think this good, some will not. The setting now takes place in the 18th century, in the North American continent, on the city of Boston, New York and the frontiers of America. This mean, we can expect less building to be climbed but instead replaced with tree running and jumping, somehow like Tarzan. This style of gameplay can offer a new way to play Assassin's Creed. The game also feature many mini games and animal hunting, a new way to earn some money in the game. The combat system are also improved here, some may find this easier or harder but it makes the combat feels more epic. Stealth have been completely overhauled with new features, such as double-counters, multiple takedowns, and chain kills. New heavy weapons type also present, the musket rifle, you can use it in melee combat with its attached bayonets or just fire it. And when the enemies are about to fire at you with rifle or pistol, you can use a human shield to protect yourself. The best part of the new gameplay is naval combat. It's so epic. You command your own ship and crew, and engage in many naval battles including the battle that involves the American and British navy. Assassins recruit are different in this game, its harder for you to recruit Assassins as the only way to do that is doing liberation missions. There are still many feature of the game that yet you can try.\nGraphics then. I must say, the game has far better graphics, textures, effects and better animation which make movement feels so smooth. The effects are also incredible. Assassin's Creed III does has better and improved graphics. The downside is the blinding white loading screen. Seriously they can use blue or maybe grey but white? It burns your eye when the game is loading a map, level or save games. Some minor graphics glitch also still present in the game. Despite that, the game runs optimized for me.\nMultiplayer has also been expanded in this sequel. New gamemodes where you have to work together to assassinate a target has been added. But Ubisoft seems to have decided to add a microtransactions in the multiplayer. That can be good or bad. But seriously the game is expensive already.\nOverall, Assassin's Creed III has better gameplay and graphics, the naval combat are the most epic part of the game. But the story isn't that interesting. Maybe because the main characters, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton or by his family name, Connor Kenway is just boring. Compared to Ezio and Alta\u00efr, Connor is just plain I think. Other than that, this game is good.\nRating 7/10", "hours": 28.5, "username": "Ank", "products": 2599, "early_access": false}

It's too bad that it gets dragged down by technical flaws and uninteresting characters.\n\nI can't comment on the stability of the console version of this game, but the PC version certainly has issues. The game crashed and had to be restarted numerous times throughout my time with it. At the beginning the crashes were very frequent until I went online and found something that helped, but didn't completely resolve the problem. Here it is:\nBeyond the crashes, I got stuck between a rock and a tree once and glitched through the roof of a horse drawn carriage and was unable to escape the inside of it. Some movements within the game were overly sticky in terms of climbing on objects when I didn't want to, or jittering on the top of a fence when I'm clearly directing it to jump down. While it controls very similarly to past games, this is a small step backward for the series.\n\nA hallmark of the Assassin's Creed series is its ability to recreate a historical time and place that feels alive and packed with places to explore. By and large, AC3 succeeds in that category. This is the most graphically impressive game in the series so far. There were numerous moments where I had to just stop and take in the scenery, particularly in the game's Frontier region. At no point did I regret the change in setting from the vast cityscapes of the previous games in the series to this new rural wilderness.\n\nIn fact, it was the cities of AC3 that held some disappointment. Perhaps this could be blamed on the setting. For instance, the historical architecture of 1700s America just can't hold up next to Jerusalem or Venice. Not only that but the people of the time were less colorful. Frontiers men and women ARE interesting, but compared to Italian Carnevale attendees? Despite those limitations I do think Ubisoft could have done a better job. There just wasn't enough variety throughout the cities to keep things interesting. Gone are the Mercenary, Romanies, and Thieves Guild buildings and their members roaming the streets. Gone are the purchasable shops and landmarks. I'm not saying either of those were particularly compelling gameplay wise but they weren't replaced by anything in AC3 and I think that resulted in a lack of depth and connection with AC3's New York and Boston.\n\nPerhaps my biggest disappointment was with the characters. Connor has a neat backstory being half British and half Native American. But as a character he's relatively flat, poorly voiced and comes off as childish at times (you play as a young Connor at one point but I'm referring to the adult here). The character I enjoyed the most is the one you play as in the opening few chapters of the game, Haytham. He has a charisma somewhat reminiscent of Ezio but is still unique as a character in the AC series. Unfortunately even his depiction is flawed over the course of the game. I found it baffling and unnecessary the way Haytham and his companions' personalities and overall demeanors were changed quite dramatically as you switched from playing as Haytham to Connor. I understand that Ubisoft was likely trying to highlight how differently each character sees the world, but what they did was too heavy handed and ultimately dehumanized a significant portion of the cast of characters.\n\nLorne Balfe did an admirable job with the soundtrack and I'm glad it was included in the deluxe version of the game. However, he's no Jesper Kyd (who composed for all the previous games). I admit I'm biased in that Kyd is one of my favorite composers while I'm not familiar with Balfe outside of his collaboration with Kyd on the AC: Revelations OST.\n\nThe 3 King Washington DLCs were a pleasant surprise to me. In them you gain animal spirit powers that can drastically change how you play the game. I had a lot of fun putting them to use. I won't be surprised if I find myself wishing I had the Eagle power available to me in future AC titles. The revisionist history that makes up the story is a fun reimagining of events. I was also satisfied with how they went about tying it in with the main story.\n\nI love the Assassin's Creed series and I really enjoyed this game. But it's hard deny that in a lot of ways the series took a step backwards with this iteration.", "hours": 70.6, "user_id": "76561197971628333", "username": "Modranto", "products": 201, "early_access": false}

This may kill the understanding of the player of what the story is really trying to tell. It doesn\u2019t help also that the missions in the early parts of the game are held in the winter, heavy snow slows everything down.\nThey tried to add new weapons and tools, but it didn\u2019t hook me enough to actually use them frequently. The UI is also consolized as usual, but one thing I really hate is the weapon UI. You can only bind up to 4 things and if you want to switch to other tools, you need to bring up the whole UI, pausing the game before you can access your weapons.\nDespite of that, features improved parkouring (you can now parkour in trees in the jungle), Stealth gameplay is also improved (a little bit buggy still), combat is also a little bit harder with the new combo and counter system.\nGraphics and performance:\nThe maps are beautifully made, with 3 massive maps and numerous smaller maps to roam, there are tons of content in this game. The forest looks amazing with the number of trees, obstacle, details and the wildlife in them. Textures are incredibly mediocre when you look at them in short distances with the exception on the outside maps (not inside animus)\nPerformance was disappointing, crossfire/SLI was not supported or badly scales. In-fact, my crossfire setup had negative scaling when CF is on. FPS is horrible in some parts of boston. The game was obviously CPU bound since my performance increased a lot when I switch my Phenom II AMD processor to an i7.\nFinal thoughts\nOverall, I think the game was just rushed and wasn't ready to be released. This is very apparent since most of the things are unpolished and filled with bugs.\nSee the developer's comment on the production of AC3:\nSo for 60$, I think that this game is really worth it. Maybe get it for at least 50% when it goes on sale.\nI spent 45 hours just to finish the story (78% completion, DLC not included) and a full 65 hours to get as close to 100% completion (Bugs prevents me to fully 100% the game)\nfinal score:\n82/100", "hours": 117.5, "username": "MDuh", "products": 7429, "early_access": false}

I have to say AC3 is one of the weakest entries in the series, and although it has some very good qualities, they are not enough to redeem the game as a whole. First and foremost, the story feels like it underwent heavy cuts in all the wrong places. There are parts of the game that literally advance oon a very slow pace, with mundane actions that, unlike in the Ezio games, do not offer any insight into the characters or, if they do, the characters are often too uninteresting to relate to. The way they implemented the main character into the actual history is also all kinds of messed up; he was basically everywhere, and he single-handedly won the War of American Independence.\nAnother problem I found very anoying was the controls. They are the same sort of sticky controls as in previous iterations, but I found that for some reason the character never seems to go where you want him to, and just tries to stick-climb to the nearest surface. This is VERY annoying when the game itself demands precision. After a while I just gave up trying to do the tasks needed for full sync, since they felt more like a chore rather than fun (AC4, on the other hand, did these full sync tasks right). Also, don't get fooled by the trailers that look like they promise huge battles and freedom in the way you may tackle them. Your participation in both of the big battles that appear in the game is very linear and unsatisfying. This is true for most of the main story missions as well, which basically amount to: follow this guy, listen to conversation, kill a bunch of guys, run away.\nNow, all is not bad: the graphics are good, pc optimization is alright, and some of the side missions are actually pretty interesting (building the homestead, for example). The best part of the game for me was, undoubtedly, the naval missions, which are regretably only a handful (at least it felt like it, since they were so much fun). I'd dare say I even found the controls and feel of the sailing a bit better than in AC4; the weight of the ship factors strongly, and it's not so easy to steer as in the latter, which felt a bit too arcade-y for my liking. Still, I find AC4 to be the best of the bunch, and would recommend it strongly over any of the others, followed by the also fantastic Ezio trilogy. AC3, on the other hand, fell flat on expectations and is the worst game in the series, only after the first one, which hasn't aged well at all.\nPD: I also finished the DLCs which, I have to say, are even worst than the main game. They focus strongly on combat, making you fight a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665-ton of soldiers even for the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665iest of rewards. Want to open a chest? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, fight 50 guys. Want to talk to Ben Franklin? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, fight 50 guys. Want to walk down the street? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, fight 50 guys. I'm not even joking, even the smallest encounter feels like you just killed half the population of colonial America.

Well I wasn't about to put hours of play time into a game that I could lose at any given moment so I shelved the game till they patched it. Well 2 years and 1 baby later I dug it out and decided to try again. Right away I was annoyed with all the movies between missions. Now I've played most of the AC games but I don't immerse myself in the storyline. I found with this game a lot of the times I didn't really know what my mission was or what I was suppose to do. My only compass being looking for the ! symbol on my map. I few times I had to look for a walkthrough online.\nI only made it about 19% through the game before I had enough.

Whoever was in charge of designing the accounting book needs to be fired. I got stuck in it twice before hitting the forums to find out there was a second tutiorial, that is NOT obvious. Even then it was confusing to work through and craft items.\nOne of the things I always liked about AC games is the ability to step out of the storyline and just go around looking for feathers, completing achievements, unlocking weapons, assasinate at random, ect. It has always been obvious, items you need to complete these things and the rewards you get for doing so. I had no idea what was going on with this one. Even the clothing you buy just showed a crate, not what you where buying, so there is no way to preview until you purchase it. The side game play wasn't as intuitive as previous games.\nBottom line it just wasn't fun. I was forcing myself to play and just get through it.

I mean, there's a lot of stuff to do. A LOT.\nOkay, so the story wasn't the high point; Connor is an angsty teenager who's one a revenge quest for the death of his mother and the burning of his village. While his goals are similar to that of the Sons of Liberty, that is, when he meets them, he's careless and anxious. I praise Ubisoft for getting the character of an overly anxious youth correct, but his weakness is where his mind is fogged and forgets about what he should be concentrating on, being an Assassin.\nAC III is short on espionage and heavy on combat. (oh wow, an AC game short on espionage and heavy on combat, go figure) But the combat is amazing and actually improves from the previous installments once you get used to the controls.\nYou get to meet a lot of historical figures, and while I enjoyed their presence, they clutter the game and it seems like the writers tried to juggle around the historical figures without making any of them close acquaintances, aside from the fictional Achilles Davenport. I would have liked to see more of the Culper Spy ring, as they would have been a huge bonuse in terms of espionage, but Ubisoft looked the other way with their revenge mission.\nThe graphics are great. I feel like I shouldn't have to mention that. This is Ubisoft after-all. And they didn't lie when they said the frontier was huge. I mean, it's huge, bigger than Rome. And then you also get Boston and New York City. I'm glad they added the two cities as runnig around the frontier got old rather quickly. It's just too big with too little content, as in story. There are citizen missions and hunting and frontiersman. Okay, there's actually a lot to do in the frontier, it's just a real pain getting around.\nDid I mention all the content in the game? Building the homestead, recruiting assassins, saving citizens, naval missions, collecting trinkets, collecting feathers, finding treasures, capturing forts held by the templars/British, frontiersman missions, hunting missions, Boston brawlers, getting convoys, getting the almanac pages. There's a lot of content, including the DLC, which I found fantastic.

On one hand you have Assassin's Creed's now already signature phenomenal world realization in every respect, which happens to sadly be offset by being in a game which simply can't get me to give a damn in the grand scheme things. This off-putting switch in question occurs after a sizable prologue section when game replaces a much more charismatic stand-in main character with a proper one who has all the likeability of a lonesome rock. And that's probably the main fault of AC3 - Connor simply cannot carry the weight to be an interesting character and, by proxy, make for an interesting game. This results in clearly emotional moments and twists falling flat on their faces because there's ZERO emotional investment going on. Your mileage will also obviously vary depending on how much you're into the time period in question, but this has always been one of the stipulations for the series.\nThat's not to say Connor's personality backed by bad-to-forgettable VA is the only thing at fault here, though. Replacing sprawling cities of previous games with trailblazing colonial towns and explorable frontier was honestly because it directly cuts into the effective use of series' hallmark parkouring abilities. But once again, this is seemingly balanced out with the inclusion of brand new sailing segments which manage to, for the most part, be optional and not overstay their welcome... unlike the all-present repetition seen in other activities throughout the game.

I don\u2019t believe I've ever been able to play more than an hour or so without some freeze, story glitch or outright crash to desktop.\n2) Ubisoft's support is nonexistent and in the few, extremely rare circumstances you actually get a response, it is of zero help or reeks of incompetence and/or no concern to paying customers whatsoever.\n3) BE WARNED and DO NOT BUY the Tyranny of Washington DLC. There is a well know issue in the first episode that completely make progress impossible. There have been thousands of online posts and nothing in the way of support or a fix from Ubisoft.

But let's take it point by point.\nFirstly, what i always liked best about the game, the world. In this game it's not very enjoyable. It does look very detailed and realistic, but the movement fluidity suffers greatly for it. The frointeir is the best example of what is wrong with this part of the game; it's large, nice to look at, but almost completelly devoid of stuff to do. There is also no practical way to fast travel though it, which means that no matter how good-looking the forests might be, the game will foce you to run though them so much, that you'll wish the environment was destructivle, just so that you could vent your frustration.\nSecondly, combat. This is actually the best aspect of the game. The attacks and counters are not guaranteed, you'll need to focus on them, which makes them more satisfying. The game furnishes you with a lot of melee weapons, so you can pick your favourite style. Not against animals though, there you need to qte or die. The problem with melee combat is that more than a half of it is never explained and not obvious, and yet required by missions.\nThere is also ranged combat, well, this is nice. But it's inefficient and pointless, really. You'll try it for a bit and go back to swords and daggers.\nLastly there are additional gadgets like rope darts, which give you additional kill mechanisms like hanging your opponent. This is nice sometimes, but again is largely pointless and will be disregarded by most players.\nNow then, the missions. These are nice in the beginning, but boring later. The synchronization is either not challenging, or frustrating due to poor design, depending on mission. The ship missions are badass though, but again suffer from synch failures.\nThe worst aspect of the game are the characters. Connor is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ty and annoying. He is also painfully bland, which he tries to make up for by yelling, a lot. Think an annoying cousin of bruce willis here. The other characters are even worse. The story characters are just sad to talk about. The british ones are caricatures, clearly the game devs thought that making this a yankee doodle with bad, evil british would sell well in the US, sad just sad.\nThe last good part of the game is the multiplayer, which is still good and adds some new modes.\nSome last thoughts. The crafting system is long winded and pointless. The minigames are horrible as the AI never makes a mistake. The historical reality is an insult. Lastly, side missions and activities are ENTIRELY POINTLESS, like much of the rest of this game.\nI recommend that you stay away from the game.

The first being the VERY long tutorial/training section of the game. Without any spoilers, you almost have to go through Connor's entire childhood before you are really set free upon the world. Also on the PC version, there were some graphical and audio glitches. While we are discussing the PC version, one of the biggest issues I had was how badly optimized this game was for PC. Don't get me wrong, I have a GTX 770 and a 4770K, which are by no means entry level or mid range. However, I still had MAJOR, and I mean MAJOR frame rate drops. I would coasting along at 60FPS and then suddenly as I turn the conner to look at 4 people, BAM!!! 40FPS.\nIn conclusion, I would skip this game I were you.

This game is ELEGANT. More often than not in a game that is this far along in a series, mechanics are lost or ported to the new game without revision or change. This is not the case with AC3. It takes the already near perfect game elements of the previous four titles and hones them into this beautifully polished game package. Things like free-running, cinematic combat, story missions, commerce...they all just shine. It is very easy to tell Ubisoft Montreal poured their hearts and love into polishing this game to the hilt. My lasting impression of this game is that it is very ELEGANT and very POLISHED.\nBut the mechanics aren't the only thing to shine in this game. The world does! It is the small touches that don't go unnoticed.  NPCs go about their daily business and have conversations, livestock and pets wander the streets and the environmental, weather and particulate effects (such as fog or leaves blowing in the wind) help make this already wonderfully immersive world come to life. It is ridicuously well done and I tip my hat to Ubisoft once again.\nThe praise continues with the deep story and character development (of the templars, Assassins and modern day crew) coupled with extraordinary voice acting all interweaving to create a gross, engaging narrative. Hatham, Connor, Desmond, Altair and Ezio all feel like completely different assassins with different styles and I particularily enjoyed playing as Conner. As a character I found him very intriguing with a lot of depth. As a man trapped between many worlds he struggles to find a balance of whom he is...does he leave behind his heritage or embrace it? We see him change throughout the story from a boy that believes only in Black and White Morals to that of a wearied man that is forced to walk in the grey. He is honest, brutal and above all altuistic, a very interesting mix for an assassin. Conner for me felt different to that of Ezio in how I approached the game. He felt more, raw and direct, brutal in combat so that is how I played. Less stealth and more action. It is  not a bad thing! Just a character departure from the other games which is welcome with the changing of the guard.\nIt took me 51 hours total to 100% this game so it was one of the longest in the series for myself (I tend to average 40hours or so for a typical AC).\nSo in conclusion I highly reccommend this game. It is immersive, polished and fun. A true triple A title!\nP.s: I didn't comment on the abrubt ending as I feel my thoughts will change as the sequals develop and are released.

Theoretically, this setup would enable amazing possibilities like learning about history and having fun at the same time - at least that is the idea behind the whole series I guess, since the historical accuracies were advertised a lot when AC3 was published. I am completely aware that this is a game and not a historical textbook, so I am not even disappointed about inaccuracies of any kind. What really disappoints me is that neither the aspect of historical exploration nor the Action-Adventure part is really hooking the player up. I actually stopped playing after I finished about half of the game, because it was simply boring. Besides the totally messed up controls, and annoying game mechanics like QTE's and similar stuff other people comaplained about, the thing which disappointed me most is the story. The main story lacks logic and development, it never becomes clear, why those characters do what they do. They run around, kill people here and there, join historical conflicts, but there is no clear motive, they are just a bunch of conspirers fighting for some unknown greater cause. Above this, the historical backround does not more than serve as a nice background image. The thing you encounter most are highly stereotypical depictions of evil Brits, innocent native Americans being burned and slaughtered by evil Brits and stuff like that. They have a whole simulated historical town of Boston, it looks alive and authentic, but it does not get you interested in the city at any point. The most exciting thing you can do is ride around on a horse or climb church-roofs and jump down again. Side-quests would have been a really great opportunity to introduce the live of colonists, to get interaction with the NPCs. But there is nobody you could even talk to, the crowd is nothing else than a place to hide and to rob (which they dont even mind!!!). I could go on for hours but I stop here, because it would not change what I have to say: ACIII is neither a good action-adventure, nor an interesting history simulation.

This is also half of the game, and they kill much of the open world feel, that \"do as you will\" feeling AC games are known for.\n2) Don't try for 100% sync. The 100% sync goals in the AC2 series were usualy fun and tricky, and rarely a chore. AC3 reverses this badly. Few of the optional 100% sync goals are fun and thought/technique provoking. The vast majority are a horrible tedious grind or QTE, or worse, you wish it was QTE; Most require tens of reloads to reherse the EXACT sequence of moves to get through. ZERO FUN for 100% sync, culminating in the worst 2 minutes ever produced by Ubisoft in the AC franchise, Seq 12 Mem 2 -> Chasing Charles Lee.\nMore than a few posts comment how by the time you get to the endgame, you just want to get through it to the end and be done, like getting a root canal without painkillers.

There is only one positive aspect to this game, and that comes with reservations: the setting. Ubisoft does a pretty great job of portraying Colonial/Revolutionary America as well as the tensions between the colonists and Native Americans. The historical figures they have the game show thorough research on part of Ubisoft as does the scenery and props throughout the world. The only reservation I have is that an AC game has no place in this setting and completely breaks it. You can get away with street brawls and guard stabbings in Renaissance Italy, Byzantium, and the Caribbean but you can't convincingly have that in Colonial America. Just think about the \"Boston Massacre\"...barely anyone died in that, and that was one of the pivotal events leading up to the Revolution. You could never run through the streets cutting down British soldiers and get away with it. Not only would you bring down reparations from the Brits but the Colonists would probably reject your underhanded tactics as well.

I played this as part of the Franchise Blitz I did during November and December, with the view of getting through the Assassin's Creed games back-to-back before playing Assassin's Creed IV on the PS4 in the New Year.\nI had enjoyed the previous games (somewhat surprisingly so considering my dislike for the first Assassin's Creed game), and was looking forward to this one. Even though other people had warned me away from playing it, I HAD to play it as it was the last link before Assassin's Creed IV. This is written retrospectively, as I've since played & finished Assassin's Creed IV.\nThe short and sweet of it is that Assassin's Creed III is essentially more of the same, so if you've enjoyed the AC games so far you'll know what to expect in regards to both positive and negatives in the game. The fight mechanics haven't changed too much at all, though they have been slightly upgraded to include some new fist fighting mechanics and counters. There's also a bunch of new weapons, such as pistols and rifles, but for the most part I played with the 'tradititional weapons'. So don't go into the game expecting a major overhaul in that regard.\nHowever, what they have started to expand is the size of the world. The game world is massive, and is a real precursor to what they wanted to achieve in Assassin's Creed IV. The game is still 'hubbed' but the hubs are pretty vast (if a little lifeless and pointless at times) with a central travel hub connecting them. There's a few things to do in each hub, most of which are trademark Ubisoft collectable quests, yet there's also a return of the investable Villa concept as you build up your own homestead.\nNow it could be that I was playing through the game quickly, but just like in Assassin's Creed II I never really felt there was enough reason or time to really benefit investing heavily in your Homestead and building up a team of helpers around it.\nAlso there's the introduction of sailing, which would later become a huge part of Assassin's Creed IV. It's introduced as a small side quest late on in the game, so I never really put much time into it, but it was an interesting idea and one that I'm sure would have been fun to play if you were going to invest the time into it.\nSadly, the major issue I had with this game was something I couldn't really overlook - the main character. Without spoiling the game (hopefully) there's a design issue where you're sort of left playing a character you don't really want to play. It's not really the character's fault too much, it's just that there's a far more interesting and fun character I found myself wishing I could be playing.\nIn terms of story if you love the American Revolution, you'll probably find this interesting (depending on how liberal you can be with historical accuracry). I personally enjoyed the setting, as it was a refreshing change from Turkey and Italy, and it allowed for a 'modern' feeling to the game in regards to weapon changes.\nThe long term Desmond story is also (sort of) resolved in this game, so if you're invested in Desmond's story there's some interest for you there too.\nIn short fans of the series will enjoy the Easter Eggs and nods to the previous games (however fleeting they were), as well as the setup for Assassin's Creed IV. However, it's probably the weakest in the series so far due to a lacklustre character, even if the supporting cast is pretty damn good.\nRemember Haythem.", "hours": 19.4, "username": "Chris", "products": 1901, "early_access": false}

Unfortunately unpolished in a rush to release before the apocalypse in the plot becomes outdated. What follows after this may contain spoilers, be warned)\nHmm...where to begin, well the beginning seems as good a place as any.\nI started out quite frustrated with it, Haytham barely seemed better then Ezio (Please note, I never played Brotherhood or Revelations, because I hate Ezio, he represents everything I despise about playboys and is effectively nothing more then a skilled stereotype). The gameplay seemed improved, I was a huge fan of the new combat system, though I wish they'd stop telling me when to parry. For the first three sequences, I was picking up hints that Haytham was evil, partially because I didn't want him to be the main character of the story, but mostly because they were there.\nThen we found out he was a Templar and I fistpumped.\nI'll admit the first couple memory sequences with Connor before you get your Hidden Blades are tedious, but the same can be said for Ezio. I was bored in places, but tree running and the atmosphere of Connor's village were EXCELLENT, as well as Charles' villain speech which broke my heart as he was the NICE one before. Connor's mother's death really hit me in the heart. As we continued to see Connor develop, as a genuinely goodhearted (seriously? my autocorrect tried to make that goosehearted, gonna have to disable that) honest guy who wants to protect his people and do the RIGHT THING, I began to actually like him. I can only figure Ezio was loved by so many because he was charismatic, but honestly, he always felt fake to me. He was a selfish, revenge driven, arrogant, selfish, spoiled brat with enough word skill to get people to like him. Connor's humble morality was thus refreshing.\nI mean, someone who places some actual value on human life! Wow! That's a change from the quippy moraley bankrupt mass murderers of the past games!\nConnor's story really breaks my heart, more so then any game I've played (and yes, I have played Bioshock Infinite.

Chasing missions could be very frustrating too. Let's take the final Charles Lee chase mission as an example. You have to be very close to your target, but it is not very clear which route you should take, or which route the developer wanted you to take. Take a \"wrong\" one, you fail. Try to take a shortcut? You fail! I have tried five or six times before I finally had a correct guess.\nSide missions are even worse. Remember the \"break up the fight\" homestead mission?\nAnd oh, Desmond's first 2 missions are quite good compared to the Cornor's missions.\nCombat system has been changed dramatically. I'm netural toward the change, but as you counter every enemy reliably with your basic weapons, there is not much point in buying new weapons. The whole economics system becomes irrelevant for this reason. Hunting feels shallow. Naval combat feels fresh, but still need improvements. Free running system is dumbed down for the worse.\nFor exploration. Most areas in the game are not worth exploring. Boston and NY are basically the same. Inside each city, buildings are very homogeneous. In previous AC games, in order to sync your view, you have to climb to the top of a landmark building, and while you are climbing, you have to sovle a mini puzzle, i.e., figuring out how to climb. All these are missing in AC3. All landmark buildings are identical, and climbing to the top is far too easy! In the frontier, you have to climb up some tall trees to sync your view. All those trees are absolutely identical! Exploration, a major charm of AC games, have been taken out.\nThe only strong point is the story. Gone is the black-and-white narrative in Ezio's games. Reflections on the nature of Assassins order and Templar order are well-done. So is the game worth playing for the sake of the story? I think not. The poor designs of the missions will distract you from the story. It would be much better to watch a cut-scenes compilation on youtube to enjoy the story.\nFor AC fans, skip this one, go ahead and play AC 4!", "hours": 39.0, "user_id": "76561198024067676", "username": "samuelandjw", "products": 166, "early_access": false}

But can this new installment to the Assassin's Creed games really live up to my hipe?\nThe first time I really played this game I was like, wow, look at these graphics! Assassins Creed 3 has some of the most impressive graphics I have seen! But that does mean this is the best game that I've played. The game machanics are fine, but they do feel kind of lazy. The game is also far too easy, they give you the option of upgrading you equipment, and making it better, but you can beat the whole game by just using you starting equipment! aside from that, the combat is way to easy also, I could go into a town and just massacre every soldier in the city without dying. Uside from that, you can only kill soldier's, you can't kill town's people, and such. I know killings town's people is kinda morbid; But it would of been awesome if they could give you the option to do that if you wanted to, (like the other Assassin's creed games), you can't even punch them. aside from all the negativity I just said, I did enjoy playing this game, the ocean combat is amazing!

The main story set in colonial America is a good one: it's arguably the best Assassin's Creed story to date. The character development and central plot are all intriguing, and it's the first game in this series to operate without a stark hero-villain contrast. The Templars don't seem so evil and the Assassin's don't seem so good. I like that. The developers took a bit more risks with the story, and that's a good thing. And despite his negative press, Connor is an excellent character, and without a doubt the best assassin to date. What people seem to forget is that a character does not need to be likeable to be a strong character, and that's what he is: a vehicle for all the emotions he carries and the pain of his people. Him and the main villain Haytham alike are both very well-written.\nThe gameplay is solid as well. Simplified free-running makes things easier on beginners, although the new design of combat admittedly does make things far too easy, especially for veterans. The homestead missions are a nice change of pace and contain more of Connor's development, as well as the liberation missions and forts, which are a ton of fun. The naval missions are excellent, easily the strongest part of the side content, so much so that Assassin's Creed IV was practically built on them. The Frontier is also a great place for fun, as is hunting and ambushing soldiers as they walk through the forest.\nThat said, there are more than a few weak points. Several elements, like the underground, the courier missions and the assassination missions (the part of the game that should be quite in-depth) are either a drag or just half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 They're not even good time sinks, unfortunately. The amount of bugs in this game is also extremely annoying: from poorly moving lips to collision issues to weapons randomly unequipping... the list goes on. It gets annoying, and if you play long enough, it becomes nigh unbearable.\nUltimately, the complaints of Assassin's Creed III can be boiled down to this game being a case study for a title that lacks polish. Little details that could have been easily fixed or tweaked to be either repaired or significantly better have been glossed over, and the game suffers for it. However, it is still a good (not great) game, and with its current price of 20 dollars, I recommend it for any fan of the series.\nMy rating is 7.5/10.", "hours": 47.8, "username": "Legendoom", "products": 228, "early_access": false}

The AC series has always had certain elements which I personally have loved, such as free running, in-depth story, and a enviroment that anyone would love to explore. This game disapointed me by taking out almost all those elements.\nMost of the elements kept in the series, such as the Assassin Recruits, was so horribly done they may as well not have been there. I used them simply if they were needed, unlike the other games where I would use them all the time. The new \"Abilities\" they have were practically useless unless the quest was using a particular ability to be successful. However, those were few and far between, and I soon forgot about them. The crafting included was also useless, I don't think I crafted a single thing past the tutorial, and not even sure if I crafted anything then.\nMy single biggest complaint, they took out the expansive enviroments for free running. In AC 1 and 2 and the rest of Ezio's games, I loved all the buildings to climb, the streets to walk through, the dress of people walking by, etc. I was expecting something similar in this game. I was severely disapointed again. Most of the free running was so scripted I stopped wanting to do it. The buildings were so much smaller they may as well have been non-existant. All in all, I wouldn't even want to call this an Assassin's Creed game simply because it took out the most basic element of any Assassin's Creed game. Yes you could climb stuff, but not anywhere near as well as you used to be able to.\nOne more bad thing, the new \"Optional Objectives.\" I personally loved the optional objectives in brotherhood and revelations, since they actually made you feel like an assassin. However, the optional objectives in this game made me scream at my computer, and wonder why the **** I need to not push people while running, or kill someone from an rooftop when they are running next to the ocean with no rooftops around. I understand the need for challenge, but they seemed so out there they were more of an annoyance then anything.\nI will say a few things I like about the game. I was actually a little glad to do some useful running around as Desmond, beyond the base you are mostly in. It was nice to explore the current time a bit to see what things are like. I also will say the combat is greatly improved over last games, and some of the combo's you can pull off are very rewarding. The ship battles were also quite fun, and I quite enjoyed the elements included, such as facing the wind properly, lowering sails to reduce speed and improve turning, and simply being on the water in a somewhat realistic fashion.\nAll in all, I'll put it this way, if you are a fan of the series, I would play this for the story leading up to the next games, which I will play. However, if you don't care about the storyline, don't play this game. This will be the first AC game I won't recommend, and hopefully the last that I wouldn't.

It's refreshing to see the Assassin's Creed series properly progress past Assassin's Creed II and its two rather similar sequels. The graphics are beautiful and the environments are very detailed. There are also a host of new mechanics such as different fighting mechanics, hiding in undergrowth, climbing trees, and hunting. In a bizarre twist of fate, Connor also gets hold of a sailing ship, which opens a whole new realm of naval combat.\nAC III continues to have the 'fun factor' of the Assassin's Creed games - free-running around in different environments is inherently an absolute gas. Unfortunately, the storyline is forgettable and a big deal is made out of hunting, which is much less fun than it sounds. The naval combat is fun and ambitious, but many other new features, such as the Assassins' abilities, are much less interesting than they seem on face value.\nAC III closes the atrocious 'solar flare' overall storyline and progresses the story of Desmond Miles.

Splintercell Blacklist, Dishonored, Metal Gear, Deus Ex to name a few.  If the game is high quality, I like to try and get perfect stealth on the hardest difficulty .  Ghost, zero kills, that is IF the games mechanics are fluid and fair.  Hard is one thing, bad level design and glitches is another.\nIs this game for you?  I'll answer that at the bottom but first the reasons I don't like it.\n1)  This is an assassin game.  Its in the freakin title for cryin out loud so you would think that assassining would be fun. Its not and its almost over an hour before you even get a target.  At least in the older games they give you a target and let you go for it.  This game limits you in just about every way possible.  No mechanics are improved that means you still run up the wrong walls, there is no crotch and they actually limit you in a very small zone where you can go while proformaning an assassination which limits any choices you have on the approach. (By limit I mean you and ONLY attack head on in many cases)\n2)  If 1 wasnt enough of a reason to avoid the game.  The story is extreamly boring.  You would think the setting and characters involved would make it impossible to be boring.  But it is.  At first you care about the main characters but after long drawn out conversations about nothing you stop caring.  They have all these moments that COULD be really powerful.  Historic speeches, battlefields but between the cinmatography, sound design and acting, it falls flat almost every time.\nSo is this for you?  If your like me and enjoy tight controls, being stealthly and getting that perfect kill I DON'T think you will like this game.  I recommend the ones listed at the top of this review.  If you like playing on easy and just want an action game then you might enjoy this.\nI have NO idea why I keep buying Assassins Creed games.

I would not recommend purchasing this game at anything more than \u00a310, you may as well skip this instalment of the AC series and watch a synopsis at the beginning of AC4 or a video online.", "hours": 59.3, "user_id": "76561198007936715", "username": "Blondie", "products": 273, "early_access": false}

I loved Ezio's story, but I was ready for a new man in new robes and in a new era. Colonial America in the midst of revolutionary war? Yes! George Washington and Benjamin Franklin? Sign me up! An actual bow with arrows? I can't wait! Combat was also promised an upgrade with the new ability to dual wield weapons (which included a very cool-looking tomahawk). And did I mention the hunting?\nMy initial reaction was a negative one, I'm sad to report. The disjointed story, lack of character development, and the overly long \"tutorial\" portion of the game in addition to the protagonist, a half-English and half-Native American named Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton (or simply Connor), being unlikable and unrelatable, was all disappointing to me. A previous reviewer called this game a \"well-crafted mess\" and I think this is the most apt description I've heard so far. Everything about it screams \"epic\" and it feels like they really had something big planned for the game, but there was a breakdown in communication somewhere in development and the end-product just didn't meet everyone's expectations. According to an Ubisoft employee, there were too many cooks in the kitchen. That's not to say this game is bad, it just means that it wasn't as good as it could have been, and it's nowhere near the level of its predecessors.\nSkip to the last paragraph for closing statements if you haven't played the game.\nLet's start with the story. It just doesn't \"pull\" you in and it never reaches a point where you think, \"Wow. This is awesome.\" AC II had you invade Vatican City and use Da Vinci's flying machine to glide over the towers of Venice. AC Brotherhood had you scale the ancient walls of the Colosseum and columns of pagan temples. AC Revelations (the arguably weakest of the three) even had you returning to Masyaf castle--stronghold of the Assassins in Alta\u00efr's time--in the first \"DNA sequence.\" But what do we do in this installment? Well, at one point, you run from point on point on a battlefield in a very linear, arranged fashion, trying not to get mowed down by the British army (the army that you decimate single-handed in the cinematic trailer). You also do a lot of pouting... and asking where a certain Mr. Lee might be located (on one occasion, he's simply sitting behind you). Additionally, there's Paul Revere, who rides your horse so he can warn the Patriots of an impending British attack, whose instructions can be interpreted as \"annoying.\"\nIn my opinion, the game shines when the story is focused on Haythem Kenway, Connor's father, and his motives for his behavior and his interactions with his son. Where's Charles Lee? I don't know and I don't care. Haythem, a character you play during the first few sequences, is a fascinating man and one we should have seen more of. His ending was tragic, not because of who it involved, but because of who he was fighting for. Why was Lee the one to lead the colonies to a Templar-friendly future? Why couldn't Kenway, the patently better man, do this? I either couldn't follow the logic or some important moments in the story were left on the cutting room floor in the rush to meet the release date. The rest of the Templar baddies were one-dimensional villains who get picked off one-by-one just like in the other games and they're not even committed Templars. I did find Lee to be an interesting antagonist, though he makes all the classic villain mistakes (\"I will watch him suffer and kill him later!\"). I also enjoyed the homestead and naval missions, though I felt like trading and crafting were a waste of my time; it never felt like I needed money--Connor doesn't wear armor nor does he require anything that can't be looted off a body.\nI love the new stealth elements. Connor has the ability to hide behind corners and in tall grass and brush and lure enemies to their deaths by means of whistling. I feel this was sorely needed and I hope they add more ways of killing clandestinely in future installments.\nThis game was a fresh vision for the Assassin's Creed series, which was growing a bit overly serious and stale by the end of Revelations. The formula of starting over in a new city, reclaiming it from Templar influence, and inducting forgettable minions into the Order to assist you in missions was growing tiresome. All that considered, I very much appreciate what they attempted to do with this game and the direction it's going. Connor may be unlikable, but that doesn't mean he wasn't a good character, and he's part of the Kenway story.

Some people argue that churning out a new game every year lessens the quality of the franchise. They equate it to modern war games like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Where I stand is: if putting out games every year didn\u2019t make the companies as much money as it does, they wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s our fault for buying every new Assassin\u2019s Creed that comes out. Also, you have to remember that Ubisoft is a huge company. They do have several projects running simultaneously, just because it\u2019s been a year since the last game came out does nt mean that the new game has only been in development for 12 months.\nBy now, just about everyone and their axolotl knows about Assassin\u2019s Creed III, the \u201chell yes! America!\u201d game. I\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism about ACIII but I don\u2019t think it deserves all of it. Yes, the game is one of the glitchiest things I\u2019ve ever played. Boston and New York aren\u2019t as distinguishable as previous cities in the franchise. There aren\u2019t many, if any, decent free-running paths in the cities. There are some interesting tree paths in the frontier but running through the trees feels slower than how free-running was in previous games.  Combat was improved, in my opinion, though if you\u2019re fighting too many blokes at once there are times when the combat indicators just won\u2019t work. I like how the counter has had the turtling aspect removed so that there is a little bit of skill involved. The ship missions have also been the target of many a displeased comment, but I really enjoyed them and they seem to have based Black Flag completely off of the ship missions.\nThe weakest link of ACIII is the modern day sequences. But Desmond has always been a shaking foundation to build the franchise on. In ACIII it feels like there was a huge buildup for a giant flop. What I really don't like is that Desmond is just a reskinned Connor. It feels like the developers completely forgot that the point of having the Desmond in ACII was to train him through the bleeding effect of the animus. Logically he should still run, climb and fight like Ezio did, not have an instant shift to Connor. It even goes as far as Desmond fights with a second knife that magically appears from the ether.\nACIII has an interesting story. I was impressed that Connor never chose a side in the revolution. He has reason enough to dislike the British and the Patriots. He is actually fighting for his people\u2019s safety, not for the Patriots. The Templars are aiding the British so it becomes the old adage, \u2018the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u2019 Maybe I\u2019m biased because I adore Native culture; I\u2019ve even been mistaken for a Native person (though only from racist comments). It\u2019s true; ACIII is no ACII, which is my personal favourite of the franchise. It also isn\u2019t Assassin\u2019s Creed Revelations which is arguably the worst. I\u2019d place ACIII somewhere between the first Assassin\u2019s Creed game and Brotherhood. It really isn\u2019t a bad game; definitely give it a try, especially the DLC. The episodic gameplay style of The Tyranny of King Washington was extremely enjoyable. The animal spirit power thing actually helped with stealth gameplay. If you have the chance pick up Assassin\u2019s Creed III and see how you like it for yourself but if have a choice between III and Black Flag go with Black Flag, please.", "hours": 39.5, "username": "J_S_Bach", "products": 376, "early_access": false}

No character development whatsoever, Connor is supposed to be a calm, patient person who doesn't like to kill. But his brutal combat skills contradict that fact. Also, Ubisoft advertised the game as centered around Connor as an assassin.

It should have been the best in the series by the time of its release but with a new title every year and very little changes in each the I just couldn't get into the same old thing again, and as much as I wanted to see the end of Desmonds story I still took several month long breaks after playing just a little at a time, it was only the release Assassin's Creed 4 that gave me the motivation to power through this game.\nRevelations was the first game in the series I did not get 100% sync in but I did make it to over 90% so to say that this was the first sign the series was getting tired and very repetitive would not be fair. The first in the series has been acused numerous times of being repetative, then Assassins Creed II came and for the most part kept the same concept of mission types but gave them more depth.  This leads to the problem with Assassins Creed III aside from the great advancements of part 2 this is the fifth game in the series and for the most part we are still doing those same basic mission types.\nTo make it all feel worse the game has a very long training section at the begining and for anyone who has played previous game this can make the game feel much more like more of the same.  You begin the game playing as Haytham Kenway for half of this training section and he was a much more interesting character than Connor who you will play for most of the game.  Had the main character been more interesting at least there would have been more to distract from the same old missions. I was probably 10 hours in and still in training missions when I first took a break from the game I would every so often I would try to play some more sometimes I got 1 mission done before getting bored with it and sometimes I only loaded up the game to exit right away.\nThis is not to say that this game does not add anything to the Assassin's Creed format, it does add Naval missions and had Assassins Creed 4 not come out before I went for finishing this game I may have put more time into them but as this was I only used the ship during the main missions.  Gameplay did open up later in the game and as much as I was trying to just get through the story I did find myself doing some side activities on my way to different story missions.\nIf you have never played an Assassin's Creed game you may enjoy the first half of this game more than I did.  Assassin's Creed 3 by all means should have been the best of the bunch when it was released but it wasn't.  Even with all it added it restricted itself so much early on and only managed to emphasize that the series has not changed much since the second game.

The main storyline is rather fun, though.\nAs an example, I give the process finding underground entrances around Boston. You have to lurk beneath the city and find the stations so they can be added to your fast travel list. The only challenge in finding them is following clues on every crossroad (of which there are exactly three types - light a torch, follow rats or switch on \"eagle eye\" mode) and then solve a few easy puzzles (again, about three types for some 10-ish stations).\nCombat is relatively simple, similar to the one in Batman Arkham series somewhat. It is rhytmical, and sometimes quite a bit of fun. Other times, it is frustrating. Overall, the Batman franchise pulled it off way better.\nOne of the large parts of the game is stealth sequences and these are the ones I hated most.\nPartly because of cranky controls which never seem to understand what you want to do and there is no real way of telling them (since they are largely  context-sensitive, so if you stand near something at just the wrong angle, you will perform the wrong action).\nThe second bad thing about these is that they give you very little information about your surroundings. In the best stealth actions (take Mark of the Ninja for example), you are always informed when you are doing something wrong (and given hints on how to do it right), but here, I usually find out I messed up by simply failing the mission at hand. There is no visible path to do things right and sometimes, you have to rely plainly on luck.\nOverall, if you add together the gorgeous visuals, quite interesting story, mildly amusing action sequences and plain bad stealth sequences (mostly due to the infuriating context-sensitive controls and lack of information) you get a game that is largely not worth your money.", "hours": 15.4, "username": "Remosk", "products": 446, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 379, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-02-03", "text": "45 hours.\nThe total count for hours spent in Assassin\u2019s Creed III, according to my Steam account, is 45 hours. I have no scientifically acceptable reason that this could possibly be true, but apparently it is. For a game whose faults scream louder than its ambitions, that is a whole lot of time spent killing Red Coats, climbing trees, and sitting through many, many cut scenes. Near all of the popular criticisms leveled against this 5th and final-ish installment in the popular franchise are, in my experience, justified. Today I face the challenge of trying to figure out why a game that felt inferior to its predecessors in nearly every way kept me locked in and more committed than any of the previous installments.\nOn a purely graphical basis Assassin\u2019s Creed III is a great example of how far a developer can come in a short 5 years of working on the same franchise/formula for five years straight, non-stop. Even on the lowest settings, which was unfortunately the best that my system could handle and still run at a useful framerate, I found it to be a better looking game than its predecessors with marked improvements to both environmental and character art. On a technical level Assassin\u2019s Creed III is undoubtedly a ringing achievement for the series.\nIf only it had any kind of consistency in how it used all of the tools at its disposal! The sweeping vistas of a grand naval battle at twilight or a meticulously created opera house stand in stark contrast to the otherwise, though faithfully crafted, undeniably boring expanses of frontier, snowy hillsides, and lackluster frontier housing structures. For those fresh off of the previous titles, the images of Rome and Constantinople fresh in their minds, Assassin\u2019s Creed III is going to come as quite a culture shock. And it should! We are, after all, sailing for the first time to the new world. Or so we thought.\nThe story of Assassin\u2019s Creed III is, even more so than its predecessors, broken into segments. Outside of the Animus we still follow the present-day struggles of Desmond Miles and the rest of his misfit gang of assassins as they attempt to unlock a chamber left sealed by ancient aliens in hope of somehow stopping a solar flare that will spell doom for all life on Earth. That certainly escalated quickly. The story within the genetic memories of the Animus is even further fragmented and now brings us to the colonial east coast of North America with locales such as Boston and New York in the late 1700s. There we first follow Hatham Kenway, an ancestor of Desmond and quite possibly one of the most interesting characters to yet debut in the franchise. It is revealed fairly early that, though force of habit has led you to assume that all of the ancestors that we visit through Desmond\u2019s genes are assassin\u2019s, Haytham is in fact a Templar, the ancient enemies of the Assassin order.\nCongratulations, Ubisoft! My biggest complaint at the end of the Ezio trilogy was that the games were getting a bit too rote and predictable, never changing the basic formula. It appears that they were also feeling this way because, with various levels of success, they tried a lot of new things here in terms of storytelling. The plot, which felt like something of a secondary consideration in the last few entries, takes center stage and painstakingly tells what ends up being a dramatically anti-American tale about the evils of colonialism and the many shades of gray that colored this very transitional stage of history.\nThe central character, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton (henceforth to be referred to as Conner because it is far easier to type), is an extremely serious man and is more or less as far away from Ezio Auditore da Firenze that you could imagine. He is stern, soft-spoken, measured and, some would argue, almost entirely humorless. This, I\u2019m to understand, effectively killed the game for many fans that had come to adore the previous infectiously likable protagonist. And that is completely fair. Conner will not go down in history as one of the funnest video game characters to spend upward of 40 hours with but that is not entirely the point of his character, either. He is a half-breed son of his English Templar father and Mohawk mother, raised among the native people. Even someone with the simplest understanding of colonial history would probably know that someone like Conner doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to be happy about. It doesn\u2019t work out very well for his people.\nFor all that is laudable about the intentions of the story and message that Assassin\u2019s Creed III intended to convey there remains the question of whether or not they succeeded. The answer is yes and no. For all that it has in common with the first Assassin\u2019s Creed (serious protagonist and overall heavy tone) Conner\u2019s story almost doesn\u2019t need the entire \u201cAssassin\u2019s vs Templars\u201d angle in order to succeed at all. It feels almost extraneous at times. Without many tall structures to climb and with the ability to shoot someone just as easily as throw a knife at them, Assassin\u2019s Creed III often feels like a massive action game about Native Americans and the Revolution rather than an Assassin\u2019s Creed game.\nGuns change things quite a bit, actually. Whether we\u2019re talking about the single shot, inefficient muskets and pistols on land or the colossal power of a cannon barrage at sea, the introduction of proper firearms into a series that has, for the most part, based its entire combat system on swords and knives in a massive game changer. The core of the combat is still essentially intact; you are still leaving hundreds bodies in the street with little to no serious danger to your own person. The hyper-violence of the previous games is still very much there, though perhaps even harder to swallow now because at least Ezio was nice to people while becoming the most notorious killer in history. Conner kills hundreds of people and all the while he\u2019s angry as well. The combat is far more snappy this time around, though, and a bit more simplified than the previous titles.\nThe world of the frontier is obviously less populated than Rome with fewer things to look down upon from on high. Snow is a pain in the butt to trudge through when you just want to get from one place to another (the fast travel system is a mercy and a crutch). The entire naval combat system comes entirely out of left field and yet is one of the most incredible parts of the entire game. It\u2019s not difficult to see why the developers decided to build upon that one aspect and make an entire game out of it for the next installment.\nEarlier we drew a comparison between the first game in the series and this one. The biggest thing that they have in common is the scatter-shot way that they tried new things in hopes that a few of them would stick in order to further hone in future installments. We saw this with the shallow but ambitious nature of Assassin\u2019s Creed I as it evolved its features and perfected them across Assassin\u2019s Creed II and Brotherhood. It\u2019s obvious that the team at Ubisoft has effectively reloaded and tried again with this installment. I don\u2019t imagine that we\u2019ll see the hunting or crafting or trading system ever returning in future installments without a major overhaul. The seafaring mechanics, however? They struck gold with that one.\nIn closing, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine that this was not how they wanted to conclude the series, despite all of the hints that this was to be the final chapter of the saga. Assassin\u2019s Creed III is a sometimes boring, occasionally incredible, inconsistently creative, exploded mess of an incredibly important and ambitious game. Did I love every one of the 46 hours that I spent with it? Certainly not. But it had a lot of heart that kept me invested in the journey and that has to say something about the overall package.\nOh, and the modern day ending is pretty dumb.", "hours": 45.1, "username": "Standard Issue Duck", "products": 726, "early_access": false}

It's an overly simplistic action adventure game with - ironically - excessive hand-holding tutorials and features.  The game is clearly directly marketed towards kids and teenagers, particularly when you consider it's completely nonsensical story which involves going back to the American Revolution within a computer simulation in order to stop a solar flare from destroying Earth in the 21st century.  Sure, Assassin's Creed developers, I'll take a hit of whatever you're smoking.\nThe gameplay consists of holding down a button and running forward, watching your character run freely across the landscape, climbing over walls and running along railings with the balance and coordination of a parkour master.  Occasionally, you'll hit a button to start a cinematic, or repeatedly tap a button to kill someone.  Then there's something about guns and... whatever.  This game essentially plays itself more than you play it.  It's utterly boring.  Not to avoid mention of the dialogue we're forced to listen to.

In fact you'll never like the main char and will be more mind sided with Templars as the game continues.\n- The main char is a complete tard, the way he become an assassin is dumb, he deals with his \"life challenges\" are above ridiculous.

UBISOFT manage to put so many guards in the roofs that you will pass most of the game alerting and running from them instead of having chance to explore the city. Also be aware that these magical guards uses the best alerting system in the entire galaxy, in 10 seconds the entire US Colony and British Army will be after you so you'll have to deal with 20 to 30 soldiers EACH TIME you get on a top of roof! Things get a little better once you start liberating parts of the city but that is a test to patience since the game is boring and not motivating at all!\n- The economy in this game is far from bad.

But I've spent money bribing people to stop guards from chasing me since I'm the kinda guy who likes unlocking all outposts :(\n- The combat is far from easy, \"press the button at the right time\" and you won. This certainly needs improvement.\n- Sequence 12 (the final mission) is the most absurd and idiot thing I've seen in years... and I'm not talking about Desmond history at all\n- The DLC \"The Tyranny of King Washington\" doesnt need 5 minutes to show you that it sucks harder than the main history.

As the third official installment of the franchise the game did not succeed in being any better, or even as good as the past couple of games.\nYou play as Connor, a boring character who has no personality and is difficult for the player or any fan to like. As always the game is based off a revenge story and leads into other crazy stuff like killing all of the main templar's (the bad guys), and a few stupid plot twists and other boring stuff which is highly predictable. That\u2019s about it\u2026 nothing special. Hence the title Assassin's Creed.\nThe game takes place during the revolutionary war, which gave the game a huge opportunity to have big epic battles. But\u2026 they screwed it up. No big surprise here! Due to the boring gameplay and boring linear environments (which are as bland as Connors personality) the game lacked in so much potential. Although the game is open world it felt really linear due to the story. The side missions are only ok (yet again nothing special), but makes the game a little better in very few qualities.\nWhat really bothers me about the game and the franchise in general is that there is no solid stealth system besides hiding in bushes. WHICH IS COMPLETELY BROKEN AND POINTLESS!!!! How can you assassinate people when you can't even crouch! The gameplay mechanics are repetitive and quickly gets boring. Nothing special folks.\nOne of the things I hate the most about this game, besides the horrible gameplay, crappy story, bad character development (I can go on forever), Is Uplay. Why do you need a separate launcher for Ubisoft titles? Why not just add a launcher into the game? Honestly what is the point of this program?

I sometimes wonder wether I was questioning the game more than I was actually playing it proper.\nIf you go to a wiki, or some fan-site you will find libraries of clues that suggest that almost all mechanics and features were supposed to be much bigger, much more interesting. Free-roaming America's coast in Aquila ? A more organic trade system ? A purpose for all the goods other than to get money for gear that barely affects gameplay, other than providing different combat animations ? Roots of all of these, and more, can be found and they will make a gamer's heart weep for all the lost potential.\nIt's especially sad when you play the game, roam the wilderness and witness a pair of elk fighting, or bear cubs near river. You stop for a moment and breathe in, you can sense the Frontier, the tree you've just climbed and the grand story you are part of. For a moment, you immerse yourself, like when you had that naval battle during a storm, and enemy's volley was engulfed by the wave while you were fighting the wind, or when you infiltraded enemy fort unnoticed, using a cunning ruse with assistance of  your recruits.\nFor a moment, you witnessed game the development team of Assassin's Creed III envisioned, an experience of action, history, grand political schemes and stories of the people, of wilderness and cities, a complete masterpiece that would shake up the industry, both in terms of quality and quantity of content and activities.\nAfter that moment you remember however, that to get all the unlocks you need to kill 20 more bears with that same QTE or stealth kill animation, there's about 5 fetch quests to do, 2 more guys to assassinate that are not even named, there's fort that you could try and take over with stealth, but what's the point if it's going to take twice the time and you can just run in and counter-kill everyone, main mission is optimally 2 loading screens away, good thing you've spend that hour just walking slowly around underground tunnels to get all the fast travel points ,ey ? Oh, right, gotta attend the built-in browser game to level-up my recruits, just tap space and enter a couple times. All this grind is at least worth the main story missions, right ?

(examples: Friendly A.I. killing a target that must be kept alive for mission to succeed. To soldiers instantly identifing you from 100 feet away.) Lots of polish work left undone, bugs and glitches, nothing game breaking just irratating.\nSide Note: I didn't try Multiplayer because I don't like AC Multiplayer in general.\nRank: 3 out of 5 Stars.\nPerson opinion: This is a game for fans of the series and if you can overlook its obvious issues there is a good story to be had, I would recomend the pc version as a cheaper alternative for those interested. It's in between the first game and brotherhood as far as i'm concerned. If you think their is any chance you'll like it it's not bad for the pc price.", "hours": 21.7, "user_id": "76561197983842807", "username": "~Exile~", "products": 146, "early_access": false}

They don't seem to offer much of a reward for the time they will consume, so I chose to ignore them.\nThe combat system is good but I wouldn't say it was an improvement over the other games. Just different.\nThe stealth part became more difficult because the enemies became more aware and the game didn't give more tools to deal with them. It's pretty frustrating sometimes.\nThe full synchronization conditions of every mission that I enjoyed so much in previous games is just broken. Most of the conditions are stupidly hard or just plain stupid. At some time I just didn't care anymore about them.\nThe game had some annoying bugs and it froze more times than I thought was normal, but it wasn't game breaking.\nAt the end, it's a good game, but not a great game.

The joys of running around on the rooftops and killing your next target before he even suspects you and climbing up the towers to get that umpteenth synchronization. The series has come quite a long way since the first game, what with the repetitive missions we all griped about. Unfortunately, this entry is not worth full price. I got the game and the dlc for a total of $16 on a steam sale, and put about 23 hours into it, finishing the main story and the Tyranny of King Washington. I may have spent an hour tops on the side missions before I realized they were not for me.\nThe story is eventually about a Native called Connor who goes to great lengths to not only aid in the fight for independence from England and rid the new world from templars, but also to keep his people safe from these murderous villains. He carries out assassinations on great leaders, some historical and others fictional as well as assisting in some of the famous battles and events of the Revolutionary War in the later part of the 1700s.\nThe mission segments are decent enough to provide amusement, challenging the player to move from bush to hay to tree while eavesdropping on redcoats. The best parts, as the majority has stated, are the naval warfare missions. In these segments you get to man a ship with a crew and maneuver around enemy ships as you shoot them down. My major gripe with the game is that there are too many cutscenes. It would not have mattered if they had substance, but too often it feels like these cutscenes provide little to no substantial amount of significance. Gameplay is set up from these scenes, rather than having the player go from one place to another (but there is quite a bit of that as well).\nBottom line, too much of the game feels stale and cliched.

While it has some negatives overall it is a strong entry and definitely feels like a numerical entry to the series after the Ezio trilogy.\nThe game play does a great job of stream lining many of the elements introduced since AC2. No longer having to constantly hold one of the triggers helps make combat more smooth and brings it closer to the combat you experience in the Batman series by Rock Steady. Running through the forest adds a new element to the series and helped with immersion and felt fluid. It was the highlight of the game and makes you feel like a true assassin tracking prey through the tree tops and pouncing on them from above.\nThe story does a nice job of moving things along and telling a coherent tale from both Desmond and Connors perspective. While you start as a different character for the rather long tutorial (took me around 5 hours because I had to reach all the eagle views in Boston) it does a fantastic job of setting up the game world and introducing you to characters you meet down the road. It also has an interesting twist that I did not see coming.\nThe weakest part of the story I found was the main character Connor. The voice acting was flat and monotone. He seemed to grab on to the stoic Native stereotype and never let go of it.  Most of the other characters gave at least passible emotional range but Connor seemed to have a cloud of ennuyeux about him.\nOther than Connor I really enjoyed the Desmond story line because it finally started to make some sense instead of being tremendously vague about what was going on and the Connor line had a number of twists and turns I truly did not see coming.\nIf you are an Assassin\u2019s Creed fan or just looking to jump into the series this is a great point to start. The game play is modern and the story is something to not miss.

Done. Check.\nNow with the negative :\n1. This is the most boring and clumsiest assassin you'll ever see in your life. This character - I already forgot his name just to say - is the total opposite of Ezio : no charisma whatsoever, no substance, no facial resemblance with any of the glorious assassin family Desmond is the last heir of, boring voice and poor abilities. You can't get attached to such a dull character and have any fun using him. You just can't.\n2. All the Assassin's Creed games sucked me in from the very beginning of the story and glued me to my screen, wasting countless hours to make the scenario and characters progress. This one is so annoying, I have no interest in making anything progress and knowing what happened to the saga. I didn't even understand why Desmond ended up in the animus reenacting this stupid ancestor memories. Nothing's explained or makes sense. It's like, yeah whatever, just do it because well, it's an Assassin's Creed game so let's just milk the same cow again and issue a new episode of the series.\n3. The game-play has been revised for the worst. Listen Ubisoft, there's one golden rule in gaming and in programming in general: if it ain't broken, don't fix it. Don't. Just don't. Ever. Instead, you just frustrated millions of players who enjoyed so far the continuity of playing all Assassin's Creed games the same way but you also made it much worse by complicating for no reason a fluid interface with boring menus/sub-menus and counter-intuitive controls. This is an epic failure.\n4. The AI. Oh my! The AI is as equally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 than it is deadly, depending on the time, the scenario and the situation. This is such a marker for a failed product to see the vast dichotomy between AI characters accepting you just vanished because you hid behind a barrel in their plain sight as it is when they accurately shoot you to near death when you're jumping from one roof to another, while alerting instantly every other patrols within a 50 miles radius around you.\n5. Gazillions of bugs everywhere. For everything. We're not talking about specific glitches in specific areas and such. Direct and obvious bugs like the character's cape going crazy and making him look like a ridiculous bat whenever climbing any tall structure. This is not something you can miss. Clearly, you haven't tested your product at all. Or if you have, you clearly have no respect for your customers in attempting to deliver any level of quality for your products. Let's just issue the damn thing and bang money as much as we can before they realize they bought a piece of crap. The fact that Ubisoft publicly told their customers they have no intention to fix any of the bugs, well I guess we all know now how they consider them (moooo!).\n6. Missions : 90% of the time, I have no clue why I'm doing a mission or what I'm supposed to do. I just try random things until it seems that the mission progresses. The story is so botched that they didn't even try to provide explanations of why you're doing something in the game now.\nOverall, the whole thing feels very sour: the great saga that lasted for a decade now has been burnt to the ground by the greediness of Ubisoft executives in a clumsy attempt to milk their customers. From what I can read from gamers about AC IV, it's pretty much the same disaster. Guess what, won't buy it.

Much like the previous games, AC3 did a good job at blurring the lines between historical fact and fiction and produced quite the dramatic and thrilling story and game world. My other reservations about the more widespread use of firearms were also taken care of with careful attention on the developer's part to the game's roster of weapons and tools and how combat flows in general.\nOther things the game did very well was the inclusion of hunting and crafting, the ability to build up your homested and interact with those living on it, the size and detail of the game world itself, and the naval missions which ended up being a lot more popular than I think Ubisoft Montreal ever thought they would be (see Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag). In addition the multiplayer returns once again and hits the sweet spot for those looking for a more cunning/thinking man's competition and the further strides to make the MP even more customizable and detailed work fantastically.\nOn the other side of the coin though AC3 did suffer from some set-backs.\nMy biggest complaint with the game is the fact that while Ezio was a well-written, well-developed character who was both likeable and believable, Connor is just as flat and boring as Altair was in the franchise debut. Connor is consistently bouncing back and forth between causes and ideologies and you're constantly wondering what his true motivations are and where his allegiances lay. It doesn't help too that he just lacks any kind of appealing or remotely interesting personality.\nThe second most significant issue with the game is that it's a bit wonky on the PC. Many players, myself included, suffered atrocious frame rate drops in both Boston and New York and no amount of tweaking, work-arounds, or game updates helped. Additionally there were a ton of bugs and glitches plaguing this game that turned up in nearly everything such as AI, animation, audio, and texture-related problems.\nLastly, there's just a collection of smaller areas that really could've used some work or been removed altogether. Some examples are the overly complicated and ill-design crafting and trading UI, the Frontier area just felt too big and/or lacked enough content to make exploring and travelling through it anything other than a complete chore, the underground sections of New York and Boston were just absolutely tedious, and the parts of the game that let you control Desmond in 2012 were just uninspired and lacked the amount of drama and thrills they were clearly meant to.\nAll in all, AC3 is a solid game and a worthy installment to the franchise though it is missing that trilogy-ending \"umph\" that Ubisoft was clearly hoping it would deliver.

This is no exception.\nThat doesn't mean I have no complaints myself. I still have the same complaints I did when I first started Brotherhood.

I've always been fond of the concept of maritime naval warfare in gaming, but I would never have expected an Assassin's Creed game to fill that niche. I will certainly be getting AC4 \"Deluxe\" when I can.\nAnd now for one of those silly \"out of ten\" ratings: 9/10 (would be ten if not for\n, the most frustrating part of the entire game for me)\nA little apropos: I've seen a lot of complaints about AC devs and storywriters \"failing at historical accuracy\" and/or \"realism.\" Hey uh, guys?

Check this one out even if the first 2 didnt do it for you, maybe more so if that was the case.", "hours": 20.4, "user_id": "76561197964282990", "username": "CanadianSpoon", "products": 275, "early_access": false}

Certainly a good game, but it just doesn't feel like an AC game. Rather than organically planning how and when to strike your target like a shadow in a candle lit room, you find yourself either in a linear chase sequence, or get caught in an all out brawl. The main character, Connor, had all the character of a cardboard cut out of\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665Cheney, and the characterisation of the templars was pretty poor as well.

It says that the portrayl of the British and American forces are meant to be balanced, but I don't buy it. The easiest way to figure out who your next stabbing target is is to ask them if they watch eastenders. The combat does the job and is smoother than the combat in 2, but I eel it's a stepdown from brotherhood, which came closest to perfect combat controls. Despite these flaws, I would recommend it.

Having had purchased the Freedom Edition together with my brother, I now even got myself a second copy of this what I think\n. I'm just going to outline what it is that I enjoyed so much about the fifth part of the Assassin's Creed series.\nLet's start with the\n, as this is what I believe to be the one red thread throughout all the games and thus should be paid special attention to. Assassin's Creed III has a\nstory being set in the time of the American Revolution. As a great fan of history this already got me very excited for the game. My hopes weren't disappointed either. After a couple of plot twists we encounter Connor and follow him throughout his childhood until he meets his teacher and becomes an Assassin. His story is incredibly\n, his character devekopment shows a lot of\nas we see him change throughout the story. But it's not just Connor we love about the game. The\nwe meet and interact with all are created with great detail, we get to hear plenty of stories and yes, there are some\n, too.\nBut enough with the story, let's take a look at what als Connor/Haytham/Desmond's adventures offer us. Assassin's Creed games have always been nice to look at and 3 definitely has some\n. The different seasons, night and day, the deep forests and dirty towns as well as characters and animals are well animated and look\n. What I especially liked here is the\n, that add flavour to the already great graphics. The most beautiful part probably is when you take a black horse at night when it's snowing, ride into the woods and have it rear right in front of the full moon;\n.\nLastly, let's take a look at the\nand the\n. I've heard alot of people being unhappy about these, but as I only ever play games with my XBOX 360 controller for Windows (if possible), I was okay with it. The\nthough, which felt a\nfrom time to time, but is something you get used to easily. The introduction of a bunch of cool,\nalso make these new controls forgiveable. Combat is fluid and well-paced. Another very interesting new addition to the game are the naval missions.\nwho have already played Black Flag are probably going to tell you how crappy these are, but you mustn't forget that III actually was released\nIV. They are of course not as fantastic as they are in the latest Assassin's Creed game, but since they are\nand you're\n, they are still pretty fun and a\n. Personally I wasn't a fan of them at first, but after a while even I started to love them.\nAssassin's Creed III is a\nin so many a way. It has so much to offer and there's\nyou won't enjoy it.

It's just fun.  Adding rope darts that let you hang redcoats and bandits from branches, that's just an added bonus.  The introduction of sailing and naval combat, also a big winner in my book.  For everything I'm about to say about the plot, the takeaway is that the game is fun and absolutely worth picking up.\nThe overall story isn't as strong as it could have been (ignoring the weak conclusion of the weak Desmond solar flare over-plot).  I would have liked to have seen more Ben Franklin quotes for one.  They also never got me on board with why the main character would trust any of these people.\nI would have also liked to have seen more exposure of the hypocracy of some of the other founding fathers, that while \"all men are created equal\", only land owning white men could vote and women were considered mentally inferior.  I was especially disapointed in their coverage of Washington.  Yes, they address how he was not nearly as competent a general as he is remembered, stoping short of portraying him as a coward.  They also hint at his involvement in slaughtering natives when he was a British officer prior to the Revolution.  But they gloss over how petty he was, and while the Fugitive Slave Act came after the Revolution, it would have been nice of them to made reference to his involvement in it during the overplot.  Thomas Jefferson is just barely brought in as a young man during the Tyranny DLC.  Even if they'd wanted, there wasn't enough time to get into all his personal issues.", "hours": 77.0, "username": "OmegaJeff", "products": 454, "early_access": false}

This is the difference between a big game company that listens to PC customer feedback and one that does not.

The second biggest issue with AC3 is that it is nearly impossible to use keyboard and mouse, having to default to controller.  Even with controller, the menu requires multiple movement and button presses just to navigate.  The quick select is not so quick anymore.  In widescreen the cursor does not line up with the characters and the mouse cursor must be positioned to the left or right of the target before it will be highlighted, making it difficult to shoot targets.

No. Here's what would happen in that scenario: counter -> hidden knife to the brain pan -> return to starting position. Find a different way to progress the story. How about shooting him with poison darts? That would have been more believable, since none of the soldiers ever use those.\nThe other big issue I had with the story is Conner's personality.

And yet, the entire experience seems to tease what could have been and never completely fulfills that promise. After coming off the excellent self-contained Ezio trilogy (all technically considered part of ACII), it makes sense that the aging franchise could use a bit of a face lift. Unfortunately, for every new positive change (a brand new art style, more fluid free running, excellent naval combat) the developers went after so many other perplexing points (another terrible redesign for Desmond's face, unnecessarily redesigned controls, a botched targeting system).\nIn terms of story, the game is another series of near misses. Ezio was a brilliant protagonist - likable, nuanced, well-acted - giving Connor a hard act to follow. While I appreciate the game's approach to American history as far less black-and-white than the TV ads suggested (there's actually a decent counter-balance to the \"America \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Yeah\" angle), the story seems to strike the wrong note each time you think it's about to hit a high. Character motivations - particularly Connor's - regularly seem unjustified, inscrutable, and off-key. In terms of the modern day Desmond story, well... remember Lost? There's a similar feeling here, only without any of the gratification of a strong final season.\nAlso, of particular note to Steam users: the game is terribly optimized. It took me ages messing with my router and ports to even be able to redeem the DLC season pass (which I now have no desire to play), and while the game looks gorgeous at times, it offers notoriously poor performance in the town areas, regardless of how awesome your computer is. Add onto that a number of half-cooked gameplay mechanics, and it just feels like a game in the Alpha state, that might have been excellent had it been given another year or two in the oven.

It absolutely ruins the franchise in that regard. An assassin game with basically no stealth.\nThe gameplay is fun otherwise. Free running is alwasys good, the fighting is still super easy, but at least the kill animations make it seem more complex. I prefer the controls from the first 4 games but its not that big of a change. There is hunting and naval missions. I didn't even realize there were naval side-missions until the end of the game, I actually never did any of them, because I played this game to be an assassin, lurking in the shadows, killing only specific targets.... not blasting other ships with cannon-fire (or leading revolutionary war armies).\nThe story is cool-ish. I always like alternate history story concepts, but I never really felt engaged in it. I did not feel attached to the main characters at all, which was the biggest dissapointment since Ezio was the effing man! I still enjoyed Desmond and the gang. But I wasn't really a fan of where that story went either.\nBasically if you want to play an action game with a decent story then you can play this, you will likely enjoy it. But if you were hoping to play a stealth based game with a moving storyline like the first 4 games then you will be dissapointed as I was.\nI am not recommending this game even though I gave it a 7, because it is not stealth action, and I was lead to expect that from the franchise. I still gave it a 7 though, because as a standalone game, with no expectations on gameplay you will likely find it an entertaining action experience.", "hours": 27.5, "username": "JustARegularJoe", "products": 253, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 413, "page_order": 0, "recommended": false, "date": "2013-12-05", "text": "Do you recommend this game?\nNot at full price and even then, not unless you really care about the story.\nI played this game over the past week and I am honestly surprised as to what really justifies a rating of 8.\nThis game is nothing more than an interactive story with very little to offer in terms of gameplay.\nBefore you wonder \"How could you have played this game for a week if you don't like it?\"\nI always finish the games that I start, no matter how bad they are.\nHere's a quick breakdown on what's about to follow:\nArtwork, Story, Combat, Puzzles, Multiplayer\nArtwork:\nThe artwork does a good job giving the player an impression of the time-period of the action and allows proper immersion into the story. Going from zone design to housing to outfits. The Design for Connor (one of the protagonists) sadly is not very impressive, compared not only to other games released in the same year, but also compared to other games in the AC series. I am being more harsh on this subject, considering that this game is AAA rated and has a dedicated design team.\nStory:\nI know others consider the story of this game to be cliche, but I personally like the story. To fully enjoy the story you really need to explore everything starting with AC and all the way to Black Flag. Like a lot of other AAA games the stories really shine. This being said, the game is sadly nothing more to me than an interactive story.\nCombat:\nWhile the combat looks impressive, as do the assassinations. There is no real combat in this game the entire combat revolves around countering and attacking. You can't counter the same way on all opponents to make it slightly more difficult, but the difficulty scale is still laughable. In other terms... wait for slow motion, press counter, wait for slow motion disarm/throw/kill.\nThe combat is not satisfying at all, no matter how impressive the attacks look. Perhaps the combat designers should check out some real action games and come back after they learned a thing or two.\nPuzzles:\nThe few puzzles I encountered revolved around Quick Time Events, reading BOLDED TEXT WITH GREATER FONT in \"hidden\" texts marked by a magnifying glass with riddles so difficult you feel you're being asked to untie the gordian knot.\nHere's a dumbed down example: \"Grand Lodge Above All (up), men and women in balance\" Grand Lodge Icon (top, men left, women right, scales bottom)... I feel as if somebody asked me to tie their shoes. Such an impossible task can't be performed by a mere mortal as myself. These puzzles have obviously been designed for the sake of having puzzles in the game.\nMultiplayer:\nI must say the multiplayer experience I had was quite fun, even though I got my\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665kicked a lot by more experienced players. In multiplayer you have to complete missions to buy upgrades, however you are confronted with higher level opponents right from the start, creating a rather ridiculous matchmaking. This is however not as punishing as it may sound, since leveling up is not very difficult. You have different types of missions: Identify & Assassinate a specific player while being chased by another player yourself. This sounds simpler than it seems at first sight, but I can see this becoming either very dull or very addictive very quick.\nWhat did you like overall?\nI enjoyed the story and the multiplayer experience, although imbalanced\nWhat did you dislike most?\nCombat and puzzles. The simplicity of both was quite insulting. Label the game for 3 year olds, why don't you.\nConclusions:\nBeats me why AC2, AC:B, AC:R, AC3 and AC4 aren't all expansions of AC1. The engine is the same. Could easily have been a content patch and would have allowed for owners of the previous games to join together in a multiplayer experience, allowing for a larger player-base. But I suppose this would have made it more difficult to milk the cash-cow, similar to sports games.\nInbetween the story bits and pieces, the singleplayer experience was EXTREMELY boring. Sure roaming is fun for the first 2-3hrs but afterwards it becomes dull. I'd rather take a stroll in the park if I want to see nature (it's higher resolution too).\nI play games for the gameplay, and this game had almost none. Shame on you Ubisoft, running from A->B for 15min does not count as 15min of playtime, I don't care what your statistics say.\nAt full price this game is overpriced, grab it for the story if you like, but don't expect anything else, since multiplayer will likely move on to Black Flag, leaving this game deserted and those with a competitive desire rather unsatisfied.", "hours": 87.5, "username": "G\u00fbts", "products": 144, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 413, "page_order": 7, "recommended": false, "date": "2013-12-03", "text": "This game is a shambolic mess of poor controls, oversimplified gameplay and failed stealth.  Whereas previous games in the series featured extensive roof networks (AC) and towering monuments (ACII), Ubisoft had decided that engaging cities were not, in the grand scheme of things, all that important, and ditched the huge, colourful Renaissance hubs for the mud and thatch American Revolution era villages.  Gone are the paved streets, replaced by mud ruts, gone are the beautiful ivy-covered courtyards.  It's a wholly uninviting and squat place to explore.\nThe crowds of ACIII are hardly convincing.  The children seem only to have one recorded sound, consisting of a laugh track which they will repeat in broken-record style until you run away.  Civilians can no longer be killed for an easy diversion.  Glitches abound, both in animation and in AI stealthing detection.\nCharacter development is also inadequate.  Conor is by far the least significant, least fleshed-out character of the series.  He moves with the grace of an elephant, talks as if he has had no education whatsoever (to be fair, he probably hadn't) and seems to have no real motivation for being an assassin.  Whereas Altair of AC was a ruthless, faceless angel of death whose questioning of his cult led to his humbling, and Ezio was a brash and reckless young man whose family death caused him great anguish, Conor is an unwanted child who one day returned to find his home on fire and who promptly did absolutely NOTHING of consequence.  We don't care about Conor because he seems to be the sole contributor to Desmond's personality.  There is nothing in Conor that we would ever wish to be, and no amount of shoddy combat can ever fix such failure in story.\nAC's combat was a bit rough around the edges, but it involved a fair amount of timing which could be passed off as \"skill\" in the sense that if one won entire wars with single button presses, then becoming expeditious at pressing that one button might be something to be proud of.  Nevertheless, there was a certain satisfaction in killing the final templar with a single strike; in that one perfect moment, facing his (then) greatest enemy, Altair truly seemed to be a weapon without equal in his effortless dispatch of anyone in his way.  Ezio wasn't quite as good as this, but at least he had nifty climbing abilities and additional fighting moves, and was still able to fight in a flowing manner more reminiscent of a dancer than a thug.  Conor unfortunately is just a thug.  He moves like a clown (vaulting over walls with more effort than Mr. Bean) and his attacks are purely brute force, which would suit Hitman's Agent 47 more than a supposed Assassin.  His attacks are also purely contextual animations; if no one is in range when an attack is initiated, he flails his arms around in a poor flourish rather than actually swinging his weapon, and it looks ridiculous.\nThe controls are the final nail in the coffin.  The mouse control should remain the same in menu and game; it doesn't.  AC I required two buttons to be held to run, one separating \"high profile\" actions from \"low,\" and it worked reasonably well.  ACII upped this with the sprint, which was a welcome change.  In both games the Spacebar, E key and Shift performed actions that required little directional input (except for grab, but that was a small thing), which was crucial because the left hand on PC spends most of its time covering the WSAD keys.  ACIII decided that it was preferable to suddenly change the Counter command from Right Mouse Button + Left Mouse Button to an E key binding, and dispose of the \"High profile\" in favour of making Right Mouse Button \"Sprint.\"  Surely if one button is to be made Sprint it should be Shift, given its close proximity to the WSAD and the fact that the left hand controls character movement.  Common sense would surely dictate that the second most important controlling button, RMB, should not be stripped of its previous functions and relegated to a purely ancillary role.  All these things come second nature with any measure of good judgement.\nUltimately, common sense and good judgement are exactly what this game lacks.\n*Edited time for accuracy.", "hours": 27.6, "username": "Return to Lender", "products": 278, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It is very pretty and they did a fairly good job with the boating mechanic, I'll grant it that, but that's really about all I can say that's good about it.  The story is God Awful, if you're looking for a good story, steer clear.\nConnor is a horribly dull character, his motives constantly conflict, he never matures, and he is quite possibly the least dimensional character since Desmond Miles.\nThe freerunning is massivly toned down, as the buildings are all reletivly small and they have a guard on every single roof, you'll never want to run atop the towns, but rather just stick to the roads.  There is the notable exception of the tree freerunning, which was nicely done, but unfortunatly it's not really utilized outside of a desolate forest that gives you no real reason to explore, save for finding a few collectibles.\nIf you're looking for assassinations or stealth you won't find them in this game.  Connor will randomly enter combat within cities for absolutly no reason, and there is only 1 actual assassination in the game.  While you do kill people, they are almost always part of some scripted event.  so rather than climbing atop buildings and trees to get that perfect arial strike, you get a cutscene to a small fight scene to another cutscene.\nConnor's Arsenal has also been altered, now allowing him to carry more weapons he will never need to use.  The combat is what you'd exepct from an Assassin's Creed title, way too easy.  All the extra weapons are only for show as every bit of combat can be done with just your hidden blades.  Excluding ranged attacks though.  For whatever reason they've decided to replace Ezio's amazing hidden gun, which combined both stealth and power, with the worst sets of pistols and rifles in any video games ever.  Each one get's one shot before needing a 10 second reload, meaning in the heat of combat you only get to fire one shot.  The shots are also pathetically weak and will rarely, if ever, kill anyone.\nI can safely say give this one a pass.

Although many of the technical facets of the game remain impressive - largely in the world design, which is lush and stunning in appearance - the decision to release a new game on an annual basis has resulted in a game with poor gameplay, a convoluted story with uninteresting characters and numerous bugs and glitches.\nThe graphics are the highlight of the game; I was especially impressed by the snow and ocean wave effects. The wilderness areas are a wonder to traverse, and I need to give a special notice to whomever designed those cliff-faces, which look more real than I have seen in any other game. The parkour system remains largely unchanged from previous iterations, but the more player-friendly level-design makes for easier and longer platforming sessions; a far cry from the annoying city design of the previous game (Revelations) that seemed actively hostile towards the idea allowing of free-running.\nUnfortunately, little of the rest of the game stands out. The story is dull, convoluted and full of plot-holes. None of the characters are interesting and their motivations all seem forced. The combat system, once the pride of the series, has been revamped and not in its favor; fights last too long now and the camera more often than note works against the player. The new additions to the franchise are either underutilized or pointless; the naval battles are fun but far too limited by their scripting. Worse, ship-to-ship combat is made tedious by the slow reload of the cannon so that most of the battle is spent just waiting for the guns to be ready to fire. The ability to craft new weapons and equipment is ruined by its uselessness (almost every weapon can be purchased. Anyway, most gear you craft has no purpose other than to be sold; it's actually faster and more lucrative to just sell the raw ingredients.\nLike previous games, the bulk of the content is in the form of scavenger hunts; the main quest can be done in a few hours so the developers bulked up the gameplay by depositing hundreds of useless pickups across the countryside. Collecting them all offers no tangible benefits and is a tiresome exercise even for obsessive compulsives. Plus, the game suffered from a number of annoying - albeit not gamebreaking - technical issues, such as AI that stopped responding (requiring a reload from the last checkpoint) and minor graphical problems. Nothing serious, but it just added to the feeling that the game's development was rushed.\nThe world of Assassin's Creed 3 is beautiful.

The gameplay is better than the previous games, and the quality of story remains consistent.  There are still issues with the combat system (which have been around since the first game and, to be honest, will probably never really go away), but in general, it was a quality sequel that brought a couple new fantastic elements to the series.\nThe first incarnation of Naval combat is presented here, and is well thought out.  It's a bit rough, but still a fresh new aspect to the franchise that was worth including.  The first incarnation of hunting was also brought forth in this game, and was also a bit on the rough side.  But, again, it was a nice inclusion to what would have been an otherwise decent conclusion to the initial trilogy.\nThe protagonist (Connor) is an okay protagonist.  While he does not strike out with bold ambition and clearly defined goals and well rounded personality, he manages to stay interesting enough that you don't think of him as a character better suited to sit in the background while other, more interesting characters take the spotlight.\nOverall, it's worth picking up, if nothing else, then to play through the conclusion of the Desmond storyline.", "hours": 38.5, "username": "Vendelo", "products": 712, "early_access": false}

AC III takes a huge step backward in many of these elements, presenting a puzzling combination of frustrating circumstances that leads any fan of the series to wonder \"WTF?!\" Out loud. While yelling.\nFirst, the good. AC III is the first game in the series to change the combat system from the original counter system found in AC I. Aside from a poor tutorial, the new counter system actually seems even more fluid once you get the hang of it, and I did find it quite fun to fight scores of lobsterbacks at once (usually as a catharsis from the game's other elements). Not all moves worked on every enemy, and using defense breaks and disarms provided some interesing depth to an otherwise two dimensional combat system. The addition of naval combat was welcomed and was quite fun. I didn't quite understand why my huge cannonballs wouldn't have destroyed those powder stores rather than just exposing them, but the strategy was appreciated for its progression and seeing those ships explode did bring a smile to my face. The overall story and voice acting within the game were also relatively pleasing, keeping the player engaged during the intermittent cut scenes and expositions.\nNext, the bad. AC's \"sync\" system has been something of particular interest to me since it was introduced. While I am not a completionist, I have always wanted to get 100% synchonization on all missions. It was a feeling of accomplishment, achieving a level of mastery of those missions to the degree the original legends had done hundreds of years prior. What made all those extra requirements intriguing was that they elevated the tactics needed to complete the mission those that would be seen in an action movie or comic book. They made you awesome becuase you could do it like a badass ninja. AC III took those requirements and threw into the trash and lit them of fire. They instead replaced them with tedious requirements that weren't challenging but annoying and frustratiing. They didn't make you badass. They made you do stupid tricks. They didn't force you to master the system. They forced you to game it. A perfect example of this would be the requirement that you not shove pedestrians when chasing a target through the streets. Does daintily walking by pedestrians in between sprints make you badass? No. Does it provide you with ample opportunities to shout at your screen and punch the nearest breakable surface with your ragefist? Yes. If these requirements weren't tedious, they were unreasonably difficult. Don't take fire damage while running through a burning building with poor level design and convoluted routing. Air assasinate a specific enemy, forcing you to kill everyone else before climbing the mast just for this singular reason (breaking the natural flow of the overall strategy). Etc. Et-\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing-cetera. It goes on and on. The game breaks you out of the strategy and says \"Do it this way because reasons.\"\nMy final frustration was with this game's tendency to provide game elements that seemed to act as solutions looking for a problem. They had potential, but had little to no practicality. I never found it useful at any time to use any of the additional assassins for anything other than helping me kill enemies. The fake escort, the lure, and the like seemed to be gimmicks that had no use. The only missions that begged their use were those that introduced you to them. They served no other purpose than to be introduced and soon forgotten. The homestead was a wonderful idea in concept, but I honestly didn't craft a single item during the entire game. Recipes were collected and quickly forgotten as well. I could pick up all the ammo I needed from my dead enemies. What use did I have to make any? Almanac pages were a pain to grab due to an often clunky free run on slanted rooftops, and their reward was nebulous enough to leave me feeling very comfortable to leave them on the map. Hunting was fun at first, but I felt no need to gather skins or complete lists of animal kills. These entire portions of the game seemed like needless add-ons that I increasingly ignored the more I became frustrated with the game's core elements.\nWhile I am usually one to do all side missions to get all possible story elements and complete most other parts of the AC games (feathers and flags aside), I found myself grinding out the story missions exclusively in even the early game just to get to the end (and that was only because I wanted to see the outcome of the overall story arc set up in previous games, not anything within the merit of the game itself).\nMy conclusion? Don't play this game unless you are a die-hard fan of the series. I give it a 4/10.\nThis game is like Star Wars Episode I.

However, once it has, you won't want to put it down. I have played all of the AC games, and this is my second favorite, right behind Brotherhood.\nPerformance:  The game is okay for a PC port, definitely not the best, but not the worst either. It has a fairly large number of bugs and bad audio glitches (such as out-of-sync dialogs), which I've come to expect from AC. Not gamebreaking, but it does take away from the experience a little. Its beautiful graphics run at ~50 fps with max settings on my i5 2500k + GTX 660ti, with framedrops in wide open areas.\nCombat:  This is what you came for. It is truly satisfying to brutally but swiftly murder an entire group of trained British soldiers in one epic combo. The combat is very responsive and fluid, the result of 6 years of perfecting the engine. There is a plethora of different weapons, awesome animations and ways in which to kill your enemies, such as quickly slicing throats with your tomahawk, stabbing someone with the bayonet of a musket and shooting his comrade with the gun still inside him, or hanging your foes from the highest trees with your Rope Dart.\nMovement:  The core mechanic of freerunning is still present and arguably has the best animations to date, but there just aren't enough areas to fully take advantage of it. You can now dart up and in between trees and rocks, which is pretty fun and cool looking, but the awesome parkour on top of rooftops in dense cities from previous titles is very limited.\nWorld:  The world is truly beautiful and massive, with detailed forests and rivers in the warm seasons and winter wonderlands with deep snow in which you can leave realistic footprints. There are also many different species of animals to hunt or just observe from the trees, such as bears, wolves, dear, rabbits and even beavers - and that was just the 'Frontier', the large almost untouched nature area of the world. There are also two cities, Boston and New York, to explore as well. They are not as fun or pretty as Florence, Venice, Rome or Constantinople, but still very large and with a fair number of activities to do. They are also interesting from a historical viewpoint.\nStory:  Without spoiling much, I can only tell you that it holds your hand for about the first 8 hours and the main Native American character Connor (also known as Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton) just isn't very likable or memorable, keeping to himself and sometimes making childish decisions. This is by far the weakest point of the game, but not very important since the AC story has never really been truly good, in my opinion.\nOverall, the game is extremely fun and addictive, if you can look past some minor as well as major flaws and incoherent game mechanics, such as a barely fleshed-out naval system and weird little board games that just don't seem to belong.

It is the first game to veer away from Ezio and introduces a new playable character, Connor. The game, in my opinion, has done the impossible - it has managed to supercede Assassin's Creed 1 (which was excusable as it was the first foray into these games) and Revelations as the dullest Assassin's Creed game yet.\nThe game is set in colonial America at the start of the American Revolution. You go through various towns that are key to the revolution. The cities are big, but feel empty - the colonies feel like they aren't as populated as the past cities explored by the previous games. They lack a certain character. In fact, a lot of the game lacks character - the main issue being Connor himself. You start out with Connor's dad, which gives the game an excellent intro - Haytham is an astounding character, full of wit and life. In contrast, Connor is dry, monotonous, and almost always angry. It feels like they were trying to recreate Altair, but failed to do so. Altair may have been brooding, but his character changed, and he held the role of 'badass' very well. Connor is just a bore to be with.\nThe game itself is very poorly designed, I feel. There is no sense of progression. There is no incentive to be stronger, to do side quests, to discover stuff. The weapons you start out with never feel weak, which gives no incentive to gain money, thereby making side-quests and the whole trading and upgrading mechanic near useless. As such, the game feels like a boring bum rush through the story.\nThe main story arc is so-so. It didn't interest me as much as the historically rich past settings, but that could be because I'm not American, and all the relatively small but important events are lost on me as an outsider.\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game - I bought it at 33% off because me and my sister wanted to end Desmond the Moon Bear's story arc, and even then it is a bit of a disappointment. Do not buy this game.

Some of the missions are annoying, but I felt the game balance was a bit better than the previous games - if you go for the optional objectives almost everything is challenging but not overly so. My biggest issue with missions is sometimes the objectives given are not very clear.\nContrary to a lot of other fans, I find this game to be more polished and fun than the any of the previous ones, and have put the most hours into it.

The wide open ranges of the cities, and the twisting and confusing treeline of the forest left a lot to be desired in the parkour department, and completing optional objectives like building up your homestead seemed to be very unimportant to anything game wise. The oceanic portions were fun for a bit, and the original twist at the beginning left be wanting more, however the plot just didn't follow through. The ending was a large build up that left in dissappointment, and the main character for the majority of the game made me yearn for the Desmond scenes. Overall, I wasn't that satisfied with the approache taken for this single player campaign.\nMultiplayer:\nWhile entertaining, and an improvement on the previous versions, it still falls trouble to what plagued those before it. Those who've played the game longer will have better weapons, and this kind of multiplayer isn't raking in the people like a game such as Call of Duty would. That's not to say it wasn't fun, I've spent many hours playing the multiplayer, and it's still as thrilling as ever to be stalking your prey and swing at the right moment to get buku bonus points.\nOverall, I feel the main reason to play an AC game is the Single Player, and I would have payed around $15-$20 for that.

From soap opera plot turns to graphic glitches, it is a sequel that should not be missed if it were never made. You get to climb on the trees, sail ships, hunt animals, play a very strange mini-game, and trade something somewhere that gets stuck due to a glitch unless you press a correct key sequence. I got so bored, I couldn't finish it.\nUPDATE: I hate leaving things unfinished and decided to give the game another go. It couldn't be THAT bad, I thought. I was wrong. I lost my way completely, not knowing where to go, what to do, where's the story, where are the missions. I kept falling off trees and losing battles because no buttons seem to do any sensible combos or attacks, and just mashing keys at random doesn't do the trick either. I gave up on the main story and decided that Madness of King George... ahem, Tyranny of King Washington DLC will be an improvement, and bought it on sale. I was wrong. After dying 3 times because I went out of the zone (there was no warning, and enemies were there, \"outside\"), I gave up.\nThis game is an ultimate failure, and it makes me depressed because the engine itself is just great, the amount of work that went into creating the beautiful environments, forests and so forth - is amazing, the characters animations are fluid, and all that combined effort of so many people is wasted in this cliche-ridden, shallow monstrosity of a story with second-hand dramatic plot twists that can only impress Mowgly straight out of the jungle - with a gameplay to match.\nI was walking through the forest. I saw a \"clue\" - I came closer and pressed Ctrl to look at the clue. Suddenly I got attacked by a bobcat. After defeating the beast in a QTE key-mashing challenge, I looked at the clue finally. \"Traces of a bobcat!\". You don't say. I went away, and saw two men sawing a log. It was so real, I just stood and watched. They finished sawing, and went away. I thought some story will begin, but I couldn't talk to them. Nothing happened at all. I was able to initiate a dialogue with their wives - it was long enough, and absolutely meaningless. Sort of \"hello, how's the weather\". Why was it there? Why someone's time was wasted on making this, and my time was wasted on watching this. How many African villages could forget about starvation for the rest of their lives on the money that went into this. This game rises too many questions.

After finishing the 2:d game and its sequels, the fan base had a lot of expectations of the next installment in the series. Some were met, others weren't. Unfortunately, the latter scenario proved to be truer than the former. Needless to say, the game came as quite a surprise when it first hit the internet, people being surprised at a sequel.\nIt's obvious from the get go that Ubisoft built almost everything from scratch, and it sure looks that way, with improved graphics, a fluid and satisfying fight-mechanism and the introduction of epic naval warfare. One cannot help but feel excitement when experiencing all of this within the game's first sequences. With that said, the intro-part of the games proves to be far to long and redundant, almost to the point that it feels like one enormous tutorial that you have to suffer through. It's not until some good 3-4 hours that you get introduced to the Assassin's Creed the fans are so familiar with. It's obvious Ubisoft had good intentions, also mentioning how they wanted the 3:d part in the series to be a great addition but also a great intro for newcomers to the AC games, whilst it might've helped those new to the series, it sure backfired on those already familiar with the series.\nFurthermore, it feels like the game suffers from identity crisis: introducing new graphics, a new setting, new mechanics, naval battles etc. but can't connect all of these new element into one cohesive game, easy for the players to digest. It rather feels like rollercoaster. Moments when you're out on the sea for the first time feels so epic that nothing can't beat it, only to have that special moment destroyed by introducing the player to characters that are hard to connect with, and as such making it a letdown. The same applies to all the other parts of the game, most notably the character-development. Even if Connor might not be the most charismatic Assassin we've seen, he sure have his reasons for being so, presented well done by Ubisoft, but it's just not enough to emphasize on the main characters, it's rarely the player cares for others in the game (with the homestead missions being a rare example). There was so much potential here with so many interesting characters presented to us (not to mention Benjamin Franklin whose only purpose in the game is so bleak, he's almost a non-existent one.). The Washington DLC:s were obviously a shot at character-development, but it just wasn't enough and came far too late to make the overall game any better.\nAll in all, Assassin's Creed 3 is a disappointment. Not only to veterans to the series, but also to those who are new to the series. The ideas are well presented, almost flawless. But it doesn't help much when the whole game doesn't feel connected and feels more like a well-crafted mess. Nonetheless, the good parts are so good that they lift the game, but ultimately the lack of a cohesive story and under-developed characters, lowers the game's overall quality.\nI'll give this game 3 bloody revolutions out of 5!", "hours": 66.9, "username": "Shawn", "products": 334, "early_access": false}

Connor's ultimate obligation is to his tribe, and he will go to any measure to secure its safety. The narrative starts with a playable introduction as Connor\u2019s father, Haytham Kenway, whom players eventually discover is not what he appears. The introduction largely\u00a0introduces\u00a0the new setting and gameplay options, lasting roughly a third of the game. Outside of that is the continuing framing story of Desmond, desperately trying to avert catastrophe on December 21st, 2012, and deciphering clues left by the first civilization, specifically Minerva and Juno.\u00a0\nInterspersed between 1700s missions and temple exploration, are segments set in modern day New York that allow for direct control of Desmond, set amongst a skyscraper, a Brazilian fighting match, and a final confrontation at Abstergo industries. Missions in this series have always been fun and varied, and this one is no different, although optional objectives tend to be headache inducing. Assassin\u2019s Creed III reintroduces ideas from the original game in more engaging fashions allowing for mobile eavesdropping, and the general concept of assassinating the\u00a0Templar\u00a0heads. Connor will make significant changes throughout the history of the Revolutionary War.\nControls have been simplified to a minimalistic razor, as players largely hold a button and move forward to semi-effortlessly traverse historically accurate recreations of Colonial New York and Boston, as well as the awe-inspiring frontier. New to the game are the Y-shaped traversal obstacles, a Jason Bourne-like ability to dive through windows, and general improvements to navigating the world.\nThere have been massive improvements to combat system, including motion-captured animations of sword movement, greater flexibility, and the devastating ability to chain assassinations. Guns played a major role in the revolution, and the same is true here, as the world is littered with rifles. If stealth is more your speed, Connor is also equipped with a bow and the ubiquitous hidden blade. The tomahawk proves invaluable. On the other side of the equation are the\u00a0wholly\u00a0refreshing Naval missions, as Connor steers and directs the operations of large scale combat through beautifully expansive environments.\u00a0\nFull recreations of minor details flesh out the world, lending credibility to the reality of the game. Improvements to the graphics engine allow for fully immersive weather systems and the changing of the seasons. Everything about how rain, snow, and natural atmosphere work in the world are well represented here. Shadows and lighting are incredibly realistic as well, softly filtered through tree canopies.\u00a0\nThe world map is massive, detailing waterfalls, cliff sides, and forests filled with the new animal activity. Connor will find and interact with rabbits, raccoons, wolves, bears, mountain cats, dogs, and deer, as well as the expected horses. In addition to hunting, players can now engage in optional side quests such as exploring the underground, trading, thrilling naval missions, and much more.\nOverall, this latest entry is not perfect, as there are many glitches in the game world, and some difficulties with collision detection, but the many additions to the series feel fresh and exciting, particularly the ability to explore the great outdoors. The story is complex and involving, and lasts about 10 hours, not counting the endless variety of\u00a0side quests.

Ubisoft managed to create an engaging and simple interface for the navel missions that allowed you to turn your full attention to the experience without a clumsy interface interfering with your enjoyment of them. I would have liked more naval missions, but I guess I have AC IV to look forward to soon. My only real complaint about this game is the crafting/trading system.

Tacked on like a vestigal limb I suspect was some sort of beta for AC4 is a naval component that has nothing to do with the main game and there is no point in doing.\nWhat dooms this game is the garbage controls and interface.  Sure the game has alot of content, who effen cares about content if the game is unplayable though due to broken controls.  Its like buying an encyclopedia full of knowledge but written ina  language you cant read so at the end of the day its useless.  The freerunning sucks,, your character will frequently run in the wrong direction or jump into some spot you didnt want to go.  Even the classic climb real high and syncronize they messed up where you go to jump off and instead of swan diving into some hay will land and die right next to the hay.  The interface is terribad to select a weapon or tool requires holding a button and moving around and all this garbage when it coulda just been a wheel like any other game.

Honestly, the biggest drawback is that it's set in Colonial America; there's nothing new or exciting to be had in Colonial America, it's all 'been there, seen that' (At least from the standpoint of being born and raised in America.), with the feeling that they took a crash elementary-level US History course before writing the plot.

The story feels forced and the gameplay mechanics have changed for the worse.

The UI is far from optimized and will even confuse native console players with positioning of quick weapon selection. No hope for mouse / keyboard users(I played on controller) as there is horrible mouse smoothing and all the ranged attacks are forced auto-aim. It even feels like they lazily took the disguise elements from the Hitman series and fighting elements from the Batman series(not in a good way). Overall it just seems like a mashed together, cutscene filled, sibling game elements money grab hiding behind the Assassin's Creed trademark.\nAlso.

Participating in a video-game championship, he loses in a match against obnoxious arcade player Eddie Plant in Donkey Kong. A videocassette containing footage of the event is included in a time capsule that is later launched into space by NASA, in hopes of reaching any extraterrestrial life.\n33 years later, Brenner has become an installer of home-theater systems while Cooper is the President of the United States. In Guam, a U.S. military base is attacked by UFOs of Galaga that turn pieces of the base into small glowing cubes and one of the soldiers is abducted.\nWhile working at the home of divorc\u00e9e Violet Van Patten and her son Matty, Brenner is summoned to the White House. To his surprise, he finds Violet is also headed there as a lieutenant colonel. Upon seeing the video footage and meeting with Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, a friend he made at the video game tournament earlier, Brenner speculates that the aliens have found the videocassette images in the capsule to be a declaration of war and are attacking them with spacecraft resembling classic video game characters. This is affirmed when the aliens interrupt a television broadcast, challenging Earth to a battle where if the aliens win three rounds, they will conquer the Earth. Brenner and Cooper are unable to stop one of the attacks as Arkanoid paddles sling balls of light to destroy the Taj Mahal, and another person is abducted.\nBrenner and Ludlow train Navy SEALs to play the old games. Violet develops light cannons that are effective against the aliens. In London, the aliens attack in the form of the video game Centipede, but as the soldiers are unable to beat them (as they forgot to shoot at the heads), Brenner and Ludlow step in and shoot them down. Following the victory, the aliens send their congratulations and a \"trophy\" in the form of the dog from Duck Hunt to an old woman (who appeared earlier at the London attack).\nLudlow and Cooper retrieve Eddie, who had been serving a prison sentence for fraud. In New York City, the team discovers it must participate as the ghosts against Pac-Man. Toru Iwatani, the creator of Pac-Man, flees after his hand is bitten off by him. Using four coloured Mini Cooper cars, Brenner, Ludlow, and Eddie overcome the task, but Violet notices that something about Eddie is off, as he moved at supersonic speeds around the board. They win Q*Bert as a trophy, but the aliens (as Hall & Oates) later declare that someone cheated and the contest for the planet has been forfeited. Matty discovers Eddie used a speed cheat which was written on the back of his shades, thus revealing that he is the one that cheated. When the aliens' mother ship suddenly appears, Eddie flees from it, but Matty gets abducted by the aliens.\nAs revenge for Earth cheating, the aliens launch a massive attack using characters from all sorts of classic video games on Washington, D.C. Cooper joins the team, while Ludlow stays to fight. An alien takes the form of Lady Lisa, a character on whom Ludlow had a crush since childhood. Ludlow persuades Lady Lisa to choose love, and she sides with the humans; Eddie, wishing to make amends, returns to fight as well. Brenner, Violet and Cooper are summoned to the mother ship where they face the alien leader who takes the form of Donkey Kong on the game's starting level with the aliens' captives at the top. As the group dodges barrels and fireballs, Brenner feels depressed and loses hope, until Matty reveals to him that Eddie was cheating, restoring his confidence, and Brenner eventually throws a hammer to defeat Donkey Kong. The aliens' characters then self-destruct, now that their leader has been defeated.\nThe arcaders are hailed as heroes and a peace agreement is reached with the aliens. Eddie apologises to Brenner for cheating in his life. Although Ludlow is saddened that Lady Lisa is gone, Q*Bert transforms its likeness to Lady Lisa. Brenner and Violet become a couple, while Eddie gets to meet Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. A year later, Lady Lisa and Ludlow are married and have Q*Bert children.", "hours": 77.8, "username": "\ufe3b\u82ab\u2550\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500", "products": 544, "early_access": false}

Being able to board enemy vessels or they board you would be a change of pace.\nOverall the gameplay and story wasn't as gripping as Ezio's story (because he is truly the most interesting person you will ever know.)

I've beaten every single one at least twice up until 3. The reason behind this is the character in 3 is not even remotely interesting. He's a mute with no attitude or genuine feeling behind what he does. He allows himself to be used like a puppet for everyone with an even remotely pixy fairy and rainbows situation. That is to say this is the first AC-Series game that storyline and character wise are just a complete and utter screw up. The combat is great, But when you take into account the 20ish+ hour storyline (And thats if you skip ALOT of stuff) is near unbearable.\nThankfully Assassins Creed 4 looks like its going to correct the screw up of AC3 by out shining even AC1. Would highly recommend skipping AC3. It's just a waste of your time.

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 430, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-07-24", "text": "This is one of my favorite franchises at the moment, so take your time to read it all, as it come from a real fan of the series.\nAssassins fight for freedom and free will, and this is what you don't get from this game. Starting in Brotherhood, Ubisoft implemented optional objectives. Optional objectives are optional as the name says, but if you don't met the criterias you don't sync with the Animus 100%. That means, for players like me that want to be perfectionists, these objectives are kind of mandatory. An example of this system is: Main objective: \"Kill the enemy\"; Optional: \"Kill him using air assassination\". Now, with that in mind, you could kill your target like a stealth ninja on the ground, using a hiding spot, or trying to be Superman and fight all the guards during the way. Guess what? Ubisoft don't care and they want you to kill using air assassination, screw your free will. Well, this is bad (for me at least). Assassin's Creed III made it even worse: they added a LOT of optional objectives that keep showing up during the mission. I was at some points that I just needed to pass through X situation, but I stayed (or restarted the checkpoint) to met a stupid criteria just to met the 100% sync bonus. Some people might think this is sort of a challenge or \"hard mode\", well, it is supposed to be, but some optional objectives are just stupid and takes away your freedom to decide how to complete a task. However, if you ignore them you might do just fine. I couldn't.\nBack to the game, the plot continues from Revelations and now you're on a new timeline playing Connor during US independence (which is awesome). Of course he's not Ezio, but he's a good character after all and I liked him. The beginning of the game is a massive tutorial, which is unavoidable for experienced players, as the game teach you everything you know during the storyline. You feel you're in a tutorial until around Sequence 5, and that's over hours of play. After this the game starts to feel better.\nAbout the gameplay, Ubisoft developed a new engine for this game if I'm not wrong, which affects a lot of stuff, but mostly noticeable in free running/parkour and fighting. It is good, however it feels rushed. Some stuff just doesn't feel right and during some missions or free running you can get stuck in places you're not supposed to. The game is full of cinematics, mainly in the beginning, which makes it feel like a movie sometimes. Some tools are not available anymore, like bombs and improved darts and even those left are next to useless. This includes Eagle Vision, which you use maybe 3 times during the entire game. Also, assassins have new abilities, which you will use just a few. Some are new, some are just reworks of what courtesans and thieves did in the previous games. I liked more the way assassins worked on Revelations, but that's just me.\nI want to speak good of this game, but it's hard. This game is closer to Assassin's Creed II than the previous titles, however, like I said, small details did not make my playtime as enjoyable as I would like. The game is long if you choose to do side quests, unlock all the 6 assassins, etc. With no spoilers, the ending is, like always \"OMGWTFBBQ\", kind of \"continues on next game\". However the epilogue of Connor made me feel the love for the game again. It's a simple and short epilogue, yet it summarizes what Connor was up for.\nLike I said, I'm a huge fan of Assassin's Creed series. If I wasn't, I might have stopped playing the game before finishing it. The game is great and if you like the series you should play it and I strongly suggest that if you don't mind 100% completion, avoid completely optional objectives, it'll make your playtime much better.", "hours": 37.6, "username": "MiKau", "products": 450, "early_access": false}

It is the fifth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2011's Assassin's Creed: Revelations. The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release following in November 2012.\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story proper is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control of the newly forming nation.\nAssassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, Anvil Next, for the game. The game was met with positive reviews and has sold 12 million copies worldwide.\nA continuation of the series, entitled Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, was announced in early 2013, and is set to follow Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton's grandfather - Edward Kenway - a pirate and Assassin operating in the Caribbean.", "hours": 103.7, "user_id": "76561198062711426", "username": "tehcokesnorter-911", "products": 32, "early_access": false}

However, they also include most of Connor's ranged weapons such as the Rope Dart, Poison Dart, Pistol, Bow and Arrow, and Musket.  Having the activation key on E made it more comfortable in combat.  Also functions as reload when appropriate.\n-Interact on Shift means you'll start missions with Shift, but it also delegates a number of other actions that previously would've been done with shift in past AC titles.\n-Q as Weapon Selector is to keep it close at hand, which you'll want since you only have four quick selects while keeping as many as four main weapons (I think) and at least half a dozen frequently used tools (Bow for Stealth, Pistol for combat, Rope Dart for combat, Horse Whistle, Snares, and Bait just to name a few).

I got everything except for those flags, because the only rewards were achievements. If they had included anything in-game, I quite likely would have gone and collected all of them, like I did with the feathers in Assassin's Creed 2.\nSpeaking of Assassin's Creed 2, that game was great. I bought it for myself in the week of Christmas 2009 and had completely passed it by the New Year. It was an improvement in every way over the original.\nThen Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood came out (I'm not counting any of the handheld ones) and was pretty much more of the same. It had a few improvements, the most significant of which was the ability to recruit other assassins and have them aid you in battle. I lost interest and never finished this game, but luckily Liam eventually got interested in the series and did it for me.\nAfter that came Assassin's Creed: Revelations, which added bombs and the hook blade. Which amounts to basically nothing. Liam played this one too.\nAnd now we get to Assassin's Creed 3. While it's true that this series has always been very story-focused, I think this game is the first one that actually suffered for it. The past couple were excusable, because they were just detailing more and more of Ezio's life and were like the Vice City and San Andreas of the Assassin's Creed Series - similar games built on the existing engine but not quite proper sequels (well, they were sequels, but hopefully you know what I mean).\nWhile Grand Theft Auto IV was completely different from the previous generation (whether you think that was good or bad is irrelevant), Assassin's Creed 3 was significantly less so. They mostly got rid of assassinating, and they included a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 more of Desmond \"Most-boring-and-unlikeable-character-ever\" Miles, the plot framing device descended from all of the past assassins.\nIf you haven't played the previous games, give them a go, but only get this one if you're so interested in the story that you don't mind playing a much worse game.", "hours": 92.9, "username": "KLED", "products": 1299, "early_access": false}

I love this new system of movement as it opens up a whole new environment for the series to explore and experience; an environment where you can hunt, ambush, trap, and stalk your enemies.\nThe core gameplay/combat are great fun too, with plenty more finishing moves and plenty new weapons to use.

This game was a great piece of interactive cinematic experiences of the American Revolution, and the major events in it.  Coupled with a great soundtrack that didn't overpower, but enhance the playing experience, this clearly became a top can't-put-it-down-until-I-finish game.  Good back-fill on story line for those who haven't play the series yet.  Sea battles were *amazing*, and were my favorite part of the game.  There's nothing like going through and wrecking a whole bunch of lobsterbacks to the plot music in the game.  I really enjoyed this one.\nThere were too many unimportant side-quests (lots of grinding for 100%), runs from uplay, and much better to play with a control than keyboard.\nAll in all, a must play for any American.

Sadly, that is not the case with Assassin\u2019s Creed III. It\u2019s not a bad game, but it also doesn\u2019t exactly rise to its full potential.\nPlot-wise, AC3 closes the book on the first major chapter in the Assassin\u2019s Creed storyline. Although Desmond's quest concludes, the ending leaves enough unanswered questions to allow for future games (though I suspect many may feel the actual ending is a bit anticlimactic). The bulk of the game takes place in Boston and New York during the American Revolution and feels quite different from its predecessors. Part of the \"mystique\" of those games is, I believe, the unfamiliar settings. Conversely, the setting in AC3 is much more familiar to people and I think it diminishes the impact a little bit. I don\u2019t exactly fault them for it, as I think it\u2019s a good idea to switch things up, but just be aware that you might not get the same \"wow factor\" as from previous games.\nOne thing that *did* bring the wow factor, at least for me, is the world they built. In addition to Boston and New York, there is also an expansive wilderness to explore. These areas are not only enormous, but visually beautiful (at least, with all the PC settings cranked to the max). Maybe I\u2019m just an old fogey or easily impressed, but I really was amazed at what they were able to pull off technically, in terms of the environments.\nYou play as Connor, a young Native American. He doesn\u2019t start out as an Assassin, but comes to learn the way of the Order after a series of events lead him to discover his destiny. The character is interesting, but not as immediately likeable as Ezio. One of the annoying things about the game is how they\u2019ve made Connor into an 18th century Forrest Gump - he always somehow happens to end up at (or play a part in) seemingly every major event leading up to and during the Revolution. I know the idea behind this series is that history isn\u2019t exactly what we thought it was, but AC3 really stretches it to levels of absurdity.\nGameplay-wise, AC3 is a lot like its predecessors (which is good), but somehow they managed to take steps backward in a number of areas. For one thing, they decided to completely change the control scheme (after spending 4 games perfecting it): combat and free-running are now handled differently (requiring a bit of time to re-learn), targeting is a mess, the weapon and map menus have been changed for the worse, and the stealth mechanics sometimes don't work at all. A lot of it just feels totally half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 And don\u2019t even get me started on the bugs. I can\u2019t recall any other game I\u2019ve played that was as buggy as AC3. I would run into a completely new bug seemingly every hour, many times having to reload checkpoints or restart in order to continue.\nBut not everything is bad. As I said, the environments are amazing, and the gameplay is generally OK once you\u2019ve settled into the new control scheme. So it\u2019s more of the standard AC formula, and that\u2019s not a bad thing (when it works). New to AC3 are naval missions, which look amazing and feature awesome water-based physics. I had fun with these bits, but I can also see how some people might get bored with them, as they are a bit repetitive. Luckily, these missions are mostly optional.\nUltimately, AC3 is a good, but slightly disappointing game. Do the negatives completely ruin the experience? Not really... but it is nonetheless a disappointment when a game like this has so many rough edges. For fans of the series, it is still worth playing, especially since it concludes the story. For those who haven\u2019t yet played an AC game, however, I would recommend starting with either AC2 or Brotherhood instead.\nGrade: B-\nNote: I don\u2019t recommend playing any of the Assassin\u2019s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.", "hours": 51.6, "username": "noibn", "products": 1828, "early_access": false}

The game starts off way too slow. It will take several sequences (and, therefore, hours) before you're actually able to freely move around. Add to that the uninspiring, sometimes frustrating and confusing missions, the boring, often cold and colorless setting in which the game takes place, the cumbersome way to fast travel, the (gamebreaking) glitches and bugs and there you have AC3. I can forgive the game for the smaller glitches and bugs, sure, because, let's face it, it's still a gigantic game world with lots of activity. But I just can't forgive them for the other mistakes, especially since 100+ people have been working on this game for at least 3 years straight.\nAnd now that the entire story has been told, it's time Ubisoft took the franchise in a different direction. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, and there's no need to change genres, but at least come up with some creative and innovative things for your next AC games. I'm not talking about side activities here, there's plenty of that.\nLet's make the whole thing exciting again. Don't milk it like certain other franchises (guess that's a bit late since this is, like what, the 7th game or so ?).\nWell now, on to the good stuff. Yes, AC3 uses a new engine and it shows. It's pretty good. The environments look nicely detailed, as well as most of the characters. Some of the citizens and less important characters still have that low poly look though so it's not all great. Overall, despite the sometimes poor performance, the game runs and looks very well and I can only see it get better with future releases.\nThere's more: hunting is a cool new feature that fits well in this game's theme. You could do nothing but hunt for hours and you'd still have fun. Hey, what do you know; I finally have something positive to say.\nNaval battles are also a great addition to the game. Granted, I didn't think they fit the theme that well, since your playing a Native American and all (have you ever seen one steering a ship ?), but they were fun to play and that's what's most important.\nDespite my ranting there were still times that I enjoyed playing this game, but ever since the brilliant Brotherhood I'm growing more and more tired of it with every new game they release.\nIf I had to score this game right now it would have to be a 7,5. Judge for yourself if you can.\n[Rating: 75/100]", "hours": 21.8, "username": "mark | dj.", "products": 3577, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "208480", "page": 446, "page_order": 0, "recommended": false, "date": "2013-01-10", "text": "So, this game has been out for how many months now? And there are still at least dozens of glitches and bugs that have yet to be resolved. One example would be the pistols. When you have finally reached the stage where you can build new ones, and get a belt with holsters for two, guess what happens? One of your pistols will default back to the old, rubbish starter gun, regardless of if you buy the two barrel pistols or any other. Unless of course you pay for Enzio's clothes, in which case one of the pistols will disappear completely.\nAnd then we haven't gotten started on some other things, like the fact that you're only playing as two idiots once you leave Haytham, the fact that the story contains more plot holes than even remotely good stories and scenes, or the fact that the tutorial stretches for about 4/5 of the game. That's right, you are damn nearly done playing the game once you have actually gotten to the stage where you are allowed the \"freedoms\" you would have experienced after just about an hour of gameplay in the last AC game. Bloody marvellous. This serie's quality stopped with the last game, this is simply an abomination compared to any of the earlier games.\nAnd since your character is a blittering idiot, say good bye to the days of actually using stealth and your brains during the main missions, where the story tends to go along the lines of using brute force and simply walking straight on to the target, despite being very easy to spot. The only place where stealth and remote signs of intelligence can be applied to the game would be the five minut side missions.\nNot to mention another little gem, namely the piece of Eden you get for completing the treasure hunt. It's basically a ring from the \"First civilisation\" \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t (seriously, this game was better with just Templars and Assasins, no need for all these Mayan doomsday theories and ancient alien ghosts) that is basically supposed to protect you from getting shot. Well, despite being able to deflect shots from \u00fcber modern laser blasters, it only causes about 1/6 of the shots in the game to be deflected, provided that you're at a far range and pointed in a specific direction. And to counter up for this, it seems that all shots that do hit you will be up to twice as harmful as they were before.\nOr the fact that to get full syncronisation in certain parts of the game, like the last part when preventing Washington's assasination, you simply have to rely on a glitch or bug which causes the assasin to kill one body guard and then take off running away from Washington for you to actually be capable of getting 100% syncronisation. Or a part of the treasure hunt, where you will only get enough time to hunt a man and accomplish full syncronisation about every fourth time you restart from the last check point. The other times, he is simply running too fast for you to be capable of catching up with him and completing the other objective.\nLong story of nonsense, bugs, glitches, plot holes and what-not, I regard this series to have died with the last game. This was just an act of digging up the game from its grave and tossing it into a swamp.", "hours": 171.2, "user_id": "76561198063195960", "username": "Anthony", "products": 51, "early_access": false}

Also 'Assassin's Creed III' has become just 'Creed' because there is very little assassinating and a lot of doing random stuff. Connor is a dull main character and he makes Desmond look awesome even though Desmond is painfully boring. Connor's missions are boring and sometimes frustratingly difficult and in comparison the Desmond parts are better for the second game in a row.

The storyline of the previous Assassin's Creed games kept my\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665glued to my chair, and my eyes on the monitor. However, as much as it hurts me to say, I think the writers kind of slipped on this one. The story of Connor's journey was no let down. His story kept me begging for more, which was unfortunately not satisfied by the games prompt story with an abrupt ending. I would expect to see another game continue on with the Connor's story, but I can only hope. The story outside of the Animus grows as the story inside shrinks. If you have not played the first Assassin's Creed game through Revelations skip ahead to the *** because the following may contain a slight spoiler for those new to the series. Outside of the Animus a doomsday scenario was created. Honestly, I was disappointed by it. a cleche doomsday scenario with only one man that can save all of humanity is not what I am looking for. The ending left me feeling unfulfilled. Although do not let this stop you from enjoying the story of Connor. *** Outside of the storyline the gameplay was good. They removed the use of the spacebar and have to reach to grab far away ledges. All you do is hold the right mouse button and you will go where you point. This has pros and cons. On the brightside, along with the better animations, freerunning is A LOT more smooth than it was in the previous games. On the negative side, it diminishes your overall control of the character. On the topic of freerunning, the environment has changed significantly which has affected freerunning. Rooftops are much more modern, no more flat or slightly slanted roofs. A majority of roofs in this game and slanted, making freerunning often uncomfortable. The average building is a lot higher than those in the previous games, this gives you less room for error. The roads are now built for carages and horses so they are much wider. This makes reaching the other side of the street a challenge. The viewpoints are a lot less exciting than they were in previous games, they are also a bit shorter. The changes in the environment is not to be blammed on the game. This is how buildings were in that era, it would be wrong of the developers to change that. The other single player features such as renovating shops, working with your brotherhood of assassins and etc have also been simplified. No more renovating shops. Even if you could, they are all one type of store now with very few in either of the cities. The brotherhood of assassins has minimal usability and utility. Instead of sending assassins on missions to level them up, you get assassins that do not change in level, are fixed NPC's, and frankly don't do a whole lot. You may now send your merchants on trade caravans for the simple benefit of money but nothing else.\nMutiplayer has brought a lot more to the table. It is by no means bad, it just has become more complex. I missed the simplicity of Brotherhood's multiplayer, but the multiplayer in this one will do.\nAll in all, Assassin's Creed 3's single player was turned into a much more straigt forward gameplay style. The multiplayer has been made more complicated. I would still suggest buying this game for the storyline and the gameplayer (afterall it is still fun) but not at the price of $50. Your best bet is to wait until the bugs have been flattened out and the price drops significantly, until then go 100% the other four games because they deserve the attention!

While seemingly simple and generic, the brilliance of the plot comes from how it is incorporated with real events and individuals of the American Revolution. Players will get to (virtually) relive the Boston Massacre, Tea Party, and many famous battles in the course of Connor\u2019s journey. However, the narrative gets all sorts of convoluted and as someone with little knowledge of history, I found the game failing to convey important details and distinguish the supporting cast. Fortunately, Wikipedia was there to clarify any and all of my confusion.\nThe campaign takes place across three locations: colonial Boston, New York, and the frontier. Each of the former two is divided into three districts which can be liberated from the British via side quests. Liberating a district earns Connor an Assassin recruit and a skill. Unlike previous games in which the recruits were nothing more than killing machines, the new skills now allow them to act as body guards or set up ambushes. Standing in contrast to the bustling city life is the frontier, a mixture of lush forests and sprawling plains populated by wildlife. Describing it with mere words won\u2019t do it justice, but I will say that upon finishing the main story, I found myself compelled to revisit the wilderness just to explore.\nOther new game mechanics include the ability to whistle around corners and participate in naval battles. The former must\u2019ve been nice conceptually, but its execution was extremely poor. Its purpose is to lure guards, but frustratingly enough, it doesn\u2019t always work. On the plus side, the naval battles are easily my favorite addition to the series. These side missions allow players to commandeer a warship and sail the Atlantic Ocean, defending merchant ships and fighting British vessels. The sounds and visuals when blowing up enemy boats are extremely gratifying. Also worth noting is the quality of Connor\u2019s character animation. Everything he does, from combat to swinging from tree to tree is graceful and hypnotic. The animators at Ubisoft Montreal have really outdone themselves!\nTwo of the most glaring faults I\u2019ve encountered are with the controls and multiplayer. Very often, I found my character doing stupid things like climbing up the wrong object, jumping off something in the wrong direction, or incorrectly assassinating people in a crowd. The bottom line is that the controls just don\u2019t feel as smooth or responsive as they should. From what little time I spent in the multiplayer, I found it to be extremely imbalanced and this is coming from someone with plenty of experience in Brotherhood and Revelations. The broken matchmaking system often grouped the novice players together against experienced ones. Some of the level requirements to unlock useful skills are ridiculous, giving newcomers an extreme disadvantage.  This stands in contrast to the previous titles in which skills were unlocked in custom order as long as the player could afford it.\nI feel as though I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I had planned to say much more, but Steam\u2019s recommendation limit prohibits me from doing so. I\u2019d like to note that by the time I finished the game (40 hours), I came to the shocking realization there were at least a handful of features I hadn\u2019t even touched. As with many ambitious games, this one also has many flaws. But the one thing that separates the Assassin\u2019s Creed titles from everything else is their potential educational value. It\u2019s a solid and expansive game that, to me, is more than just a piece of mindless entertainment.\nGrade: 5/5", "hours": 105.5, "username": "DaNCeSWiTHBuLLeTS", "products": 1967, "early_access": false}

The scenery isn't as good as 15th Century Rome, but the tree-running and hunting is an interesting way to kill time when you're bored. There's\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665tons of glitches and spazzing ragdolls that melt into chimneys or rocket into the air and it's kinda cheesy that you can kill people by kicking or throwing them into walls, but rope-darts are so amazingly fun and the naval missions are brilliant. Oh, also, they changed the free running mechanic so that anytime you run, you automatically go into free running, and they changed the use button to the counter button, so when I started playing it, I felt more comfortable using my Logitech controller than the keyboard and mouse, which resulted in another interesting bug.  Whenever I'd go back to a checkpoint during a mission it would change my left analog stick and the d-pad for a few seconds, then automatically switch back after using one or the other for a few seconds.  Which would result in me trying to run, but instead bringing up the weapon wheel.  If I'd automatically use the analog stick, I'd start running then stop a few seconds later as the game recognized the correct button assignment.  The only way I could find to fix that was to use both the weapon wheel and the d-pad at the same time if I ever restarted a mission.  So anyway, if you like the Assassin's Creed games at all I'd recommend this over Revelations.

Those of you with your hands down are liars. This game broke Ubisoft's preorder record (previously held by Assassin's Creed Revelations) and I know several people who bought it; unfortunately none of them got it on PC do I don't have anybody to play multiplayer with. What I'm saying is that there was tons of hype for this game, and I don't feel like it delivered on its promises.\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game a lot; but based on the improvements that each game in the series has made, I was expecting more. They promised a huge, open-world game and I was expecting Skyrim with hidden blades. As it turns out there are only four areas total for you to run around in: Boston, New York, the frontier, and the homestead which serves as your home base. There was plenty of side stuff for you to do in each of those areas, but none of them really seemed meaningful; they didn't add to the lore of the game and they didn't give interesting rewards. Getting more money wasn't something that I was concerned with; I had my hidden blades, my tomahawk, and my pistol. What more could I need? There aren't any armor upgrades or even medicine to buy like in previous games (regenerating health). I quickly stopped exploring altogether and only focused on doing the main story missions.\nThe story wasn't a disappointment. It had plenty of twists (some more unexpected than others) and I enjoyed the return to the epic decade-spanning narrative style similar to the one in Assassin's Creed II. It is much easier to understand a character's motivations when you have been following his story from before his birth through his childhood and into early adulthood.\nYou might notice that I said that the story started before Connor's birth. That is because throughout the first few hours of the game you play as Haytham, Connor's father. Many developers have gotten good at sneaking tutorials into plot-critical missions, and ACIII is a great example of that. Haytham and the other characters from the prologue are great; I appreciate Haytham's frank Britishness, Charles' door-kicking enthusiasm, and Hickey's idiocy. As my friend Katie said after he said something especially ignorant, \"I wonder what it feels like to be that uneducated.\"\nI have always found the American Revolution fascinating, and I loved the missions that happened during major historical events like the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and the midnight ride of Paul Revere. However, after those early events you stop interacting directly with the revolution. George Washington also didn't appear very often. I had been given the impression that he and Connor were going to become friends but he only appeared about four times throughout the game, and they were very brief encounters.\nAssassin's Creed III is of course the climax of the \"the world is going to end on December 21st!\" arc and thus you get to spend some time outside of the animus learning more about the first civilization. Desmond's father is one of the people there with Desmond, and their rocky relationship comes up quite a few times. I thought that the ending was a little weird. Desmond was given a choice, but the player didn't get to affect that choice. I personally would have chosen differently, but it's not like player choice has ever been something that Assassin's Creed did anyway.\nI am worried that I am sounding way more negative than I mean to here. I had a blast playing this game. My favorite addition were the naval missions. These missions were so well done, so fleshed out that they could have been their own game. I am so glad that AC4 is mostly naval combat.\nCombat has also been vastly improved. It is much easier to attack continuously and counter incoming attacks, often turning these into combo kills. Connor attacks with a lot more ferocity and violence than Ezio or Altair.\nSo yes, Assassin's Creed III is definitely worth getting, but make sure that your expectations are realistic before you play it.", "hours": 37.8, "username": "Wolf Revo", "products": 439, "early_access": false}

There were a few concepts that were freshly introduced; climbing trees, for instance. However, the mechanic was only used once or twice - and was not practical for just getting around. Same goes for most of the new content. Through most of the previous games, a lot of time was spent of rooftops, it was a lot of fun; obviously this is different now that we are in colonial America. I felt like they tried to save part of it, you could follow blocks and run across a few buildings at a time before having to get down (or fall). They also kept the rooftop guards - I'm not sure if they were really that popular back then - and they were even more dense than the Roman ones. It felt unpolished, AA didn't even work for me - and some of the animations at critical points would go haywire (mouths not moving, bodies generally spazzing out, etc). Something that I really liked was the ability to really play as Desmond, more than just at the beginning and/or end. Some of the scenes were very cool, and it transported you in a completely believable way. There were a few parts that bothered me, like the lack of a HUD when you fought (you can not tell how full your health is, and there is no real indication).\nUbisoft changed a lot in this game, mainly to keep people from getting bored with the Roman environment, and I think they could have done much better. Then again, maybe we will see another game where they improve. It was like that with the first and second Assassin's Creed; why not again?\nThe story [Warning, this might rob you of the potential experience when you play for yourself, so if you are sensitive to slight spoilers, turn back now.] felt bland, very very much unlike the last games. There was no mention of Ezio through the entire game, minus one line that might possibly have been reffering to his work. In all the other games, Altier has some lore - and is brought up now and then. A major connection was held between Ezio, Desmond, and Altier; and I did not feel that with Conner. The ending felt rushed, and wasn't really epic like what we saw in Assassin's Creed: Revelations and Assassin's Creed: Embers.\nI really wished they had worked harder on the story (Ezio's life spanned across 3 games and well over 50 hours, versus Conner, who is already on the old side at the end of 12 hours.)\nSo, in conclusion, I hope they stick to some of the ideas here.

In short it's final chapter in his story. The new protagonist is Connor half indian half british guy who is fighting templars in the era of American Revolution in 1753-1783.Like his predecessors he is able to hide in haystacks, use hidden blade adn other gadgets at his disposal, as well as new ones. Gameplay is much wider than AC 2 and it's expansions but a bit weak and not nessesary. You are now able to hunt wild animals and skin them so later you can earn money from them or later when acquiring some individuals you can craft some specific stuff which can later help in the game. For the first time you are now able to climb up trees and jump on branches which is kinda cool and good way of moving around if you stalk your target. New addition to 3rd game is Naval missions which are done very well adn very enjoyable. There are also some bad things in game unfortunately. It feels more linear and less interesting than previous games were. There are still same stuff to do like attacking templar bases and getting new troops to your Assassin guild but it's not that rewarding and time consuming. Although if you let yourself into this game you may quite enjoy it if you just take your time. All in all it's a good game to enjoy but still not polished enough.

My guess is twice as much info as all the other games together.\n- There is an endless amount of fetch quests/side missions, and in one area, there is only a few fast travel stations, so it's up on your horsie and ride towards sunset for a couple of hours.\n- The minigames are dreadful. Two or was it three boardgames and bocce. Why?\n- Unless you upgrade your ship right away, the naval missions are a pain to play as the ship is almost impossible to control. Also you are forced to play a naval mission three times. In AC:Rev you could at least skip the tower defense after the tutorial.\n- The story is long winded and filled to the brim with people who just keep yakking about this and that. And just when you think they are done, they keep going on and on. My guess is there is a failed screenwriter or two on the team - and there is a reason why they never got a career going in movies.\n- The protagonist has the personality of a wet paperbag and the intelligence of a turnip.\n- In fact I can't remember a single character from the game that I thought was funny or awesome. The \"heroes\" are non-descript and the bad guys are.. well, they are there but that's it.\n- I just ignored the present day scenes, which sadly took up a great deal of time at the end.\n- Oh and I had time to take a dump during the end credits (unskippable - the credits and the dump!) and was still able to get back and get bored by them. I would guess 15 minutes of text crawl.\nSo the conclusion to my 70 hours in Assassins' Creed 3 country:\nThere are a few hours of enjoyment when you jump around on rooftops, but other than that, it's just a very boring and very bad, although extremely pretty game.\nStay away until it's on sale.", "hours": 88.3, "username": "Fart of Presto", "products": 4802, "early_access": false}

I wanted to like this game i truly did but in my hours of playing I just never could admit I was having fun (except for the naval portions those were excellent).\nThe game starts out well enough with a great character that you like and want to continue playing as, the sad part is that this is actually the antagonist of the game and not Connor.\n(Spoiler)You find out you have been playing as Connors father Laytham who is actually the leader of the Templars in America(Spoiler ends).\nYou then play as Connor and honestly he was one of the worst parts of the game. Maybe this was the designers fault or a personal dislike of Connors consstant doe eyed innocence to the world around him even though he is constantly being rebuked not only by foes but by his own mentor. On top of that he is just a forgettable character and his motivation for becoming and Assassin is pretty standard (revenge). Moving on from Connor we come back to Desmond and the sci-fi aspect of the first civ. Desmond has changed but not exactly for the better he has seemed to have lost the depth he gained in precious games and has exchanged it for a personallity that would most likely be of an angry teenager not a grown man who knows the world is at risk. Also the way that the whole Desmond story is finally concluded felt rushed and shoe horned in to say the least.\nTo the more technical aspects the cities and setting are very beautiful but they grow very stale and boring after a short time (I would really like to know how the trees grew to provide a clear parkour path it is a miracle of nature). There are multitudes of mini objectives and collectibles but they tend to either do close to nothing or unlock a new set of robes for Connor. Oh and about the Assassins robes you do not get those till you are almost 2/3 of the way done with the game. There are some framereate problems and some texture popping caused by the lack of the game taking advantage of multiple cores instead of just one. Oh yes and be prepared for pointless and badly implemented additional objectives during missions to get full sync. By the fifth time of having to restart a mission to try and get full sync I finally said \"to  hell with it\" and just started playing the game how I wanted. Though as a gamer whenI see that big red X pop up it did mess with me and I of course would try multiple times again to get full sync. An example of a poorly implemented extra objective was during a chase scene through a crowded city it was \"Do no shove anyone while chasing the target\". This caused me frustration on a massive scale. Not only does the target run straight through crowds without knocking anyone down or slowing down he also throws down money to make it extra difficult for you. This is what I mean by badly implemented extra objectives things that are just put in to pad out the play time.\nTo sum up this is not a game that was rushed out but it feels like a game that was rushed out to meet a deadline for the holidays.
