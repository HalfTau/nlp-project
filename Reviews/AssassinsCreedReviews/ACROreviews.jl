I have played this game three times through now, and I have to say that this is my favorite Assassin's Creed game. Yes, the game as some problems, but in my opinion, it's not really a big deal. The great thing about this game is that it is somewhat refreshing, without thinking about the similarities between rhis game and Black Flag. I would have to say though, that this game is a better experience for those who are more open minded about games.\nThe main character, Shay Patrick Cormac, is arguably the most heroic protagonist of the series. For those who don't know, in this game you play as a Templar. In the \"cinematic\" trailer of Rogue, he comes out as pure evil, hunting the assassins. But in all honesty, he is more of a grey area hero/anti-hero. Without giving any spoilers about the game, they actually give him some good reasons to be a Templar. Although, that being said, he does have some problems. He is supposed to be irish in this game, and the irish accent isn't that good. for some. But the thing is that the irish accent is quite hard to do, if you're not irish yourself that is. The voice actor Steven Piovesan does a fantastic job at portraying the character non the less. He might not get the irish accent perfectly, but the way I think about it, he gives it some special charm to the voice. Those who are irish themselves are probably not going to agree, just to warn you wonderful irishmen out there (a way to think of it is that Shay is Irish-American. I don't know if that's going to help though, but it might.)\nThe story of the game I quite like. It's not a masterpiece of a story, but it's good. It takes place in the Seven Years War. This is not really that focused on, although, you get that it's in that period, since there are some aspects about it. They are, however, trying to do as much as they can with Shay's story, which is why we're here! I have played it through three times now, so that tells you at least what I think. The sad thing about the story is that it's quite short. It's only six sequences long. But it's a good story anyway, so I personally don't really mind. For those who actually wants more from Shay after the game is over, I highly recommend reading these digital Assassin's Creed Rogue Comics (they are free, I promise) made by Sunsetagain. Those are amazing, and for me at least, they made me like this game even more. You can find them at Deviantart, or at Sunsetagain's Tumblr page. (she also make comics about other AC games, and some TV shows.) There are also some familiar faces among the characters of Rogue from Assassin's Creed III and Black Flag, as well as some new faces, which is quite fun.\nThere might be some minor \"cringy\" moments in the story, but that's only some MINOR things. But this is probably caused by the animations and the sound effects. The game sadly lacks a little in this part because it was kind of a small game, because of Assassin's Creed Unity. That year, Assassin's Creed Unity was the big game, the game that were in the focus, and therefore, that game had the most funding. So that's a little sad. But nothing is perfect, in my opinion. I actually like things with a little flaws. Flaws brings a little charm to the table, which I have to say that Rogue does fairly well.\nThe gameplay is really similar to Black Flag, with the running, the killing, the missions, and the naval aspect of the game. The Morrigan is the new ship of the game, a heavily modified sloop-a-war for that time. To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan of the Jackdaw from Black Flag, but she grew on me later on. But the Morrigan is a little better, for those who thought that the Jackdaw was a little slow, and hard to manouver. The Morrigan is faster, both at speed and manouvering. This is because The Morrigan is smaller than the Jackdaw. If you are like me, you will find the Morrigan to be quite cozy. I actually love this ship, AND WISH UBISOFT WOULD MAKE A MORRIGAN SHIP MODEL FOR ME TO BUILD!!! I think of the Morrigan as a second home to myself (please don't judge me for my cheesy manners.) :P\nOkay, to be honest, there are alot of people that doesn't like this game, and that's perfectly okay. This game is not for the liking to everyone. But I strongly believe that if some more of the open minded people in the world were to try this game, they would quite enjoy it, or perhaps even love it, such as myself. This game is fantastic, because it's my little own gem. It has such a small fan base, and I would love it if people could see the \"masterpiece\" that I do. Of course, again, it has some minor problems. That is just nickpicking, in my opinion, but that is for you to decide wheither you think so or not.\nIf you are wondering wheither you should buy this game, then I say, absolutely. Go for it. I would strongly recommend it on PC, since that's where the betetr graphics are, and the smoothest experience. I payed it on PS3 first, and it doesn't really hold up as good. I am really looking forward to playing it on PS4 later on, since I myself love this game.", "hours": 22.3, "user_id": "76561198373090772", "username": "GrumpyGeek", "products": 22, "early_access": false}

The environments and locations of Black Flag got very samey and boring after a while, and I felt no real incentive to fully upgrade my ship or complete the silly Kenway's Fleet stuff (although I did do all of those things and more eventually). Rogue actually varies its environment quite a bit, going from the crowded streets of pre-revolutionary New York to the sprawling delta of the River Valley area to the frigid, iceberg-filled, freezing waters of the North Atlantic.

Otherwise, get this version on sale and you can be pretty sure you won't regret it (assuming you liked the other AC games).", "hours": 46.9, "username": "The Bryceter", "products": 389, "early_access": false}

It provides some stuff I don't recall being able to do in Black Flag which is nice, and they're fun. Overall the game isn't groundbreaking nor a fully fleshed our successor to BF.\nInstead it's like a BF tweaked in several ways, with an interesting but shorter story. The world is massive, but there's not a ton of compelling \"content\" within the world.\nHopefully an upcoming remastered Rogue using the latest engine will help address this and make it an awesome, lengthy experience.\nAt present (1-24-2018), Assassin's Creed Origins\n. If the remastered Rogue winds up using that engine and\nit will\nthe fluid experience for many players. Hopefully that issue will get resolved,\nFor now this original version of Rogue is worth getting and having some fun with.\nAnd for me - I'm in no hurry at all - I'm specifically going at a slow, leisurely pace exploring and doing the story. I'm trying to enjoy the environment, especially the sea and rampaging open waters seeking fame and fortune for a role playing experience.\nAlthough capturing towns, ports and other areas \"is a thing\", having a fleshed out economy and more flexible income generation would really add a lot to the experience. From reading up on the remastered AC: Rogue it doesn't sound like any of these aspects are touched, at all, so that's a real shame.\nI'm trying not to go find out details, information, missions or anything else externally (google) while playing Rogue. This is something I try and do for all games to help make them more interesting and fresh.\nChanging the file \"C:\\Users\\your username\\Documents\\Assassin's Creed Rogue\\AssassinRogue.ini\" with:\n- EnvironmentQuality=4\n- TextureQuality=2\ncan help a tad more in raw quality. The game doesn't \"max\" those on its own regardless of in game setting. However, making this change manually does hold. I'll be looking to see if anyone redid all assets or otherwise made any mods to further improve visual fidelity.\nFound an excellent SweetFX config ready to go on nexus.\nNexus Mod Assassin Hunter Reshade is a SweetFX Reshade that works\ngood for SMAA. I tweaked a few things in my copy maxing out its SMAA features, but even at default it's set up ready to go and look good. I also disable FXAA in the mod, and in the game, and configure FXAA through driver. You can use nVidia Inspector or nVidia CP for that.\nThe reasons to use SMAA via SweetFX and hardware FXAA via nVidia control panel (and no other combination of AA) are outlined in the article below. It's a great read and really details important aspects. In the end my game is running 4K using DSR, has max quality SMAA + FXAA. It runs incredible -\n- and looks incredible too.\nI purchased this game (Deluxe) 3/12/2015, played for a few minutes, closed it, deleted it, forgot about it.\nWhy? Because it was just more of the same underlying AC core, including some core Black Flag elements but... Too burnt. Was just too burnt out after playing BF into the ground. There's not enough difference, and deep content, in this original version of Rogue.\nNow in 2018 after finishing cleaning up my system after several years, and with a fresh new W10 Pro installation (couple days before Win7 to Win10 free went away at 31/2017) I'm going through adding back a few steam games.\nSaw this one in the library and remembered I never actually played it, so down it came.\nThe major reason is because I just finished a new round of editing the bios for my titans and many AC titles are excellent for testing 4K.\nRogue runs like perfection so far, but more importantly (and why I'm here) - I'm enjoying the game.\nI've been away from AC (all of them, but especially Black Flag) long enough that I didn't instantly sigh with \"oh... right\" soon as I loaded into the world.", "hours": 110.8, "username": "Grunt", "products": 152, "early_access": false}

When Shay embarked on a mission to retrieve a piece of Eden, he mistakenly mishandles the artifact triggering a devastating natural disaster that leaves thousands of innocents dead.

This is because it was sadly overshadowed and ignored because the game was released with AC Unity,  the game that had a ton of hype. (Ironically though, its a lot better than Unity.)\nBut let me just tell you that its none of those things I counted.\nAssassin's Creed Rogue definitely has many simmilarities with Black Flag, but they are NOT the same games. Rogue actually has more and new features than in Black Flag.\nI love the story of the game, even though it was quite short, I love it. It follows the story of Shay Cormac, a former Assassin who saw and dealt with the wrong ways of the Assassin brotherhood and the path of ignorance, selfishness and  arrogance they were heading. It takes place before the events of Assassin's Creed 3, even though this story was most probably not planned when AC 3 was in the making, they did a good job of presenting and explaining the ages before AC 3 took place.\nIn general, Assassin's Creed Rogue is an awesome game. I love Black Flag and I love AC 3 aswell, but I preffer Rouge because it is the MOST well optimized AC game in the last generation of AC games. It has great outfits, a great set of weapons such as swords and pistols, doing side stuff like collecting fragments or quest items, and completing locations are all very fun. The naval combat is also a bit different because you have a puckle gun and you can actually be boarded this time unlike in Black Flag, and you can actually escape combat. You get a silent rifle and a grenade launcher throughout the story aswell.\nThe world is awesome, even though there's only 1 major city which is New York, theres ton of exploration to be had here. The Naval system is fun aswell, you take part of the British campaign in the 7 years war and help the British conquer lands.\nTo simplify the game, its a game that was made of Black Flag's engine, but it has more and new features. An entire new beautiful map. A great short story. Tons of side stuff to do. Different tools and weapons. New and cooler outfits.

So, the other three games in a bundle were pretty new to me since I didn\u2019t know anything of a story or what am I getting myself into. I won't go into many details but\nBut\nRogue is the worst Assassin's Creed game I have ever played. Writing, story, gameplay and all the possible things are just horrible. Character development, story consistency? Nope. It feels like a cheap Black Flag DLC that was made by some sub division of Ubisoft college students who were told to make a game to graduate. They pushed the agenda and idea of the game so hard they forgot to make it sound  reasonable. Imagine a protagonist who is happy that he finally became an assassin in training, but hates being ordered around by his mentors and constantly complains about them ordering: they are assasins, assassins are free and equal; he whines about killing people yet as soon as he kills someone he didn't want to kill a moment ago he makes fun of them for the solo reason of \"You are bad!\", just to cry about the fact how inappropriate it was to kill someone, but Templars/assassins are bad, but killing is bad too and so on and so forth; assassins are shown as bandits who terrorize civilians for the solo purpose of making Templars look good.  Templars are British and Assassins are French. Not some secretive organisations trapped in war for centuries, just legit british vs french soldiers with templar and assassin symbolics slapped on their asses for the sake of calling this game an Assassin's Creed.\nI have played all AC games except of Syndicate and I have to say that Rogue is literally the worst. Gameplay wize it's even less fun than original Assassins Creed. And let\u2019s be honest while AC was boring it had great story but Rogue is very boring and has horrible story on top of that. Seriously it is just bad. If I wasn\u2019t going to beat all the AC games I\u2019d quit it already and deleted it. But alas I am suffering. Can\u2019t wait to finish it and uninstall.\nP.S. Since I am Russian I was forced to play in Russian language (thanks ubisoft) and while I always prefer original English sound and text in my games I don't hate Russian voice-overs as it is. Russian localisation is never as good as English one (the only two exceptions are Warcraft 3 and Witcher 3) but it's not horrible at the same time, though all the puns, accents and whatnot are usually lost in translation. Yet in Rogue case the Russian voice-over is even worse than the game itself. I mean boi the Russian voice-over is so freaking cringy.

As a result of that title, I bought several other AC games, including Syndicate, AC II, as well as AC Rogue. I tried to play AC II first as it was perhaps the most acclaimed AC title there is, but found the control rather clunky without a controller (also in part due to my getting used to playing Black Flag in my 40-hr playthrough). Consequently, I turned to Rogue. In this short review, I will discuss what I think of Rogue over its World-building effort and its narrative.\nRogue, in many senses, is very similar to black flag. However, as a stand-alone title, I found AC Rogue rather disappointing in comparison to Black Flag. The world that Rogue renders is fragmented and lacks the depth that an open-world game should have. The entire world map is divided into 3 sections, one for the River Valey, one for New York, and another for the Atlantic and the player is forced to travel through way points between these different mini \"worlds\". The seafaring that Black Flag was known for becomes almost a nuisance as player often time is forced through narrow channels of water, having to navigate through icerbergs and reefs for no good reason. The only feature that I can applaud was its effort in creating a sense of historicity as along the River Valley there scattered many British/French settlements, yet even these seem to suffer from a gross, generic, simplification. All of the settlements are mere side missions with no real consequences in which the Templars can help the British army to get rid of the French \"Gangsters\". There doesn't seem to be any real historicity built in, while the repetitive form that it presents itself actually undermines the immersive nature of the story. Most of these sites of interest remains unvisited after I've completed the entire game, while the game doesn't seem to provide any real incentive for the player to visit them anyway. The only benefit for the player in completing these side quests are a measely sum of reward that can easily be gained through other revenue and some collectibles, useful only if you are aiming to get an 100% completion. They are just there to fill the empty space on the map so that the title can hide its linear structure under the \"open-world\" catergory. Despite all these, I do wish to acknowledge that the devs did a great job in recreating models for cities such as the historical New York and Lisbon. The visuals were absolutely stunning, although they suffer the same lack of depths.\nThe story-telling of Rogue are perhaps even more lackluster: In short, it doesn't make any f-ing sense. The idea behind the story is brilliant! It's basically trying to break from the Genre's single view point of the assassins and have a fresh take of the Templar's perspective, yet the execution of this idea can only be said to be sub-par at best. I understand that a major constraint to the story-telling might very well be the length of the game -  in a mere ~15hr game, one has to expound on the dynamic between ideas such as \"order\" and \"freedom\" while conveying it through the life story of Cormac, the assassin-turned-rogue. Yet the entire story just came out as utter nonsense, failed in both its intricacy and its consistency. There are way too many loopholes in the story, and the gameplay around the story just came off as lazy. The entire political dynamic between the Templar and the Assassin are simplified as such: the Templars are (connections with) British army (whom, mind you, will still come after you even if you are doing their Colonel's bidding), and the Assassins are basically French Gangster that terrorize local citizens for god-knows-what reasons, despite the fact that both organizations are by nature GLOBAL. The Templars depicted in the game are no Templars from AC Black flag, whom supposedly controls all levels of the government in secret. They really are just batmans, whom try to fight lowlifes that hides in bushes. Accompanying this confusing dynamic between the Templar and the Assassins were extremely unsatisfying filler quests, such as the like of this:\n\"Benjamin Franklin's Lightning Rod got confiscated by the British Army, go and steal it back so he can perform scientific magic over this ancient artifact!\"\n*The next paragraph contains minor spoiler for the story, albeit a pretty darn bad story*\nThe centerpiece of the story is the transformation of Master Cormac, and this transformation is done terribly, in an extremely inconsistent manner. We learnt from the start of the game that Cormac was a great guy that most people in the Assassin's group like. He respects his mentor, although he doesn't quite like one of the older assassins. The reason that he left Assassin is therefore not personal (not because of any grudges towards any specific individual), but rather, due to his particular notions of ethics. He found it despicable to assassinate an old man who cannot fight back, although this old man supposedly wishes to change/destroy the known world. Once he found out that the Assassins were responsible for the destruction of 2 cities due to their ignorance of the power of the artifacts, he practically flipped out with his mentor and decided to take the matter into his own hand (to steal the map and destroy it), instead of trying to reason with the persons that supposedly he trusted the most. A characteristic that we see from Cormac during this period is that he doesn't take authority kindly, whether it is from the old, reverend Assassin or his mentor; yet after his becoming a Templar, he seems to have absolutely no qualms with taking orders from anyone. The transformation from an assassin to a templar happens when Cormac believed that the templars saved his life (and thus becomes his friend) while the assassins betrayed him (noted this is completely personal), instead of the moralistic \"I am doing what is right and I am saving the world\" reason. We also never really see the true idea behind the Templar's cuase, as it is always in the form of \"the Assassins are bad bad people, and they are wrong.\"So the picture painted here is one of mixed signals: on the one hand, Cormac loved his assassins friends and broke off due to moral commitment of not killing innoncent citizens; on the other hand, we never really see moral commitment of the Templars' (except perhaps the one moment of \"let's take care of the thugs that threatens the local villagers!\"), instead we see a wierd friendship between the templar Colonel and strayed assassin, a friendship that's almost miraculous. The supposedly spirited, moralistic assassin Cormac, when turned into a Templar, is also somehow perfectly Okay with sacking French Colonies and stealing from the treasury (not to mention all those other atrocities that a player might commit). These wierd inconsistencies, coupled with the generic assassin's creed quests made the game a lot less convincing than it could have been.\nI will not recommend the game on the ground of its story. It really should have taken the form of a Black Flag dlc, but as the matter stands, buy it if you just want another 15 hour or so of Black Flag experience.\nI rate it 6/10.

Sometimes, there are Assassin's in your area, and you'll have to kill them using your eagle vision. Being a Templar is awesome for one game. This game is for me one of the best AC games because you're playing a templar and the story is something I'd expect if an AC game was like this, but it's still enjoyable. The only thing that makes me still a little bit dissapointed was that it has the interface of AC: Black Flag (one of my favorite games of all time because Black Flag was my first game of AC) that I dind't really like honestly. It also has the ship mechanics, which was the best part of Black Flag, and it's the same here. AC Rogue is a damn good game.

I didn't like the Ship's fights at sea at all in AC3 but somehow\nhowever, this time around I really loved it.\nThe game is polished with many things to do, lots of collectibles, renovations, side activities such as: Unlocking taverns, Games in taverns, Assisting and rescuing people, Freeing captured French zones, Freeroam at sea and raiding ships.\nI honestly thought it was brilliant, but it does become repetitive after a few dozen hours, at least for me. There are 3 regions/zones, 2 Sea based maps with islands and New York. The sheer size of the world is gigantic!\nGraphics looks great, As I mentioned before my last game was AC3 on PS3 and this one looks really good in ultra and steady stable FPS, good optimization on Ubisoft's part.\nAnd this time for the very first time you get to play as a Templar. Very unique for the AC franchise and it keeps the plot interesting. Also Assassin's are being sent after you, yes this is true. They will blend in the environment and attempt to kill you, This is very fresh and unique, but it was annoying as heck that every damn mission I went through I had to be careful not to being getting destroyed by them. In other words.. THERE ARE TOO MANY DAMN ASSASSINS...!\nMy main gripe with the game is that its short, I have over 20 hours into it, but I explored alot of islands and collected collectibles. Without these activities, by my estimation this game takes about 6-8 hours to complete if you rush through it, unlike the former AC games, which are quite longer than this.\nThe Verdict:\nHonestly a great game, Absolutely worth the money I paid for. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, the characters, the huge vast open world, it is a splender to behold. If only this game was 5-10 hours longer I'd love it even more.\nGameplay: 8/10 same as AC3 with a few new improvements, but overall movements and climbing is the same, same as for the combat. You are however given a grenade launcher, which I found hilarious to bombazle 4 enemies at ones then hiding and doing the same to the next group of enemies who appear to help their comrades.\nGraphics: 8.5/10 Great, but could be better. Overall It's not a breathtaking game, but we have to remember that this game was optimized for the last gen consoles. And that my friends, is a solid reason.\nStoryline/Plot: 9/10 I found being in a Templar shoes for once can be interesting, to see the Templars idealism and convictions.", "hours": 23.6, "user_id": "76561198010597539", "username": "HarbingerOfDestruction", "products": 69, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "311560", "page": 11, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-09", "text": "Imho the best game of the whole Assassins Creed franchise. Let me tell you why:\nIt didn't try to reinvent the wheel. Instead, the devs took the skeleton of AC4 (which was nice by itself), put in more relatable characters and a more interesting story and set it all in a colder environment. And they fixed all the bugs and optimized performance. All in all a really nice game.\nOne of the most important aspects of a game is that you can play it without being annoyed by bugs or frame drops. AC Rogue manages that awesomely: It runs on my notebook (3d gen i7, GTX660M, win 8.1) on near max settings and it runs smoothly (neither AC3 nor AC4 had constant high frame rate). I did not encounter any mentionable bugs nor any frame rate drops that went below 30fps. It also runs perfectly fine on my gaming PC (6th gen i7, GTX1070, win 10) with no compatibility issues whatsoever (unlike AC2 of AC Brotherhood). All in all 10/10\nThe story line isn't very long (i guess just playing through the story would be 20 to 30 h) but it is interesting. AC Rogue tells a tale of redemption, which is a nice change from the classic \"arrogant young boy grows up to be a decent killer\" - schematic the other AC games posess. The caracters are diverse and unlike so often not either 100% good or 100% bad, which makes them much more relatable.\nIt is no epic quest like the Ezio-story but it's a solid fresh standalone story. Oh and did I mention that the out-of-the-animus part is really short and has some nice puzzle elements? Thumbs up for that!\nAll in all 8/10 - it was a bit short after all.\nOne word for that: perfected.\nThe game lets you choose your own approach to the missions: you can decide yourself whether you want to sneak past anyone, stealth kill everyone or slowly walk in and slaughter any attacker (why hide? wou are a templar after all). There are no necessary mission goals like \"don't be detected, even if you kill the guy before he can get help\". All those goals are optional and just needed for 100% sync or a bit of extra cash.\nThe Parkour is quite smooth but relatively easy. A HUGE plus is that from the beginning there are no restricted areas - everything you can reach after finishing the story is also reachable at the very beginning of the game.\nThere is a nice variety of weapons and tools at your disposal and switching them is quick and immersive. Personally, I kind of miss the dagger from the first games, but the rifle (yes, you have a pistol AND a rifle) more than makes up for that.\nThe naval part is also perfected: It is much like in AC4 but with some major improvements that make the gameplay much smoother.\nSince the game is not very long, there is no need for repetitive grinding.\nSolid 10/10\nIt''s basically AC4's graphics in optimized. No new and fancy and frame dropping new beta visuals, but solid, tested, stable graphics. You can see that it was programmed for last-gen-consoles and equivalent PCs, yet it still looks really nice and delivers an epic ambiente. And (I cant mention it enough) it runs perfectly stable even on older machines.\n9/10\nAll in all a 9 of 10 - it's an awesome game - try it out!", "hours": 90.5, "username": "james005", "products": 43, "early_access": false}

Its very interesting to see how the characters developed, and with the obvious set up to Unity. It is slightly rushed at the beginning, Shay could have used more time to develop his motivations but its enjoyable nevertheless.\nEssentially Black Flag 2.0, the gameplay mechanics such as naval combat, warehouse raids, hunting etc are carried over with a few new additions. These additions are fun, but I personally would have preferred a longer main story arc as sometimes the map screen is full to bursting with collectibles.\nI am an unashamed fan boy of the series, but not a fan of the direction it has headed.

Was this a spin-off game like Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation? no... this was a main series game, tying in the story of Black Flag and AC3 and even Unity together. It seemed like it was going to be just as important as Revelations was when that game tied in Altair's story to Ezio's with Desmond's. But from all the gameplay footage, it just looked like Black Flag except... winter. But who knows, it might be good, well after playing it and completing it in 7 hours... errr....\nThe story begins with Shay, our new protagonist, working with the Assassins. Achilles recieves news from Adewale that the artifact they're looking for is capable of destroying cities, but they must stop the Templars from reaching it, so Shay is sent to collect it. Shay travels to Lisbon to retrieve it, but activates the artifact and destroys the entire city. Shay returns and blames the entire thing on Achilles, claiming he's the evil one, wanting to see cities destroyed and innocents killed... now wait a damn minute... there's nothing that Achilles says or does that shows he wanted to destroy the city, in fact he tells Shay \"be careful, we have no idea what it could do\" so why is Shay blaming Achilles? Then all of a sudden the Assassins start attacking Shay???? wtf? Do they not know what communicating is? Sit down and discuss what happened??? thats what Adewale did with Achilles, he didn't yell \"YOU DID THIS!!!\" and betray the Assassins... its obvious Ubisoft needed a reason to make a game about Templars which btw at this point we've had twice technically... we had AC3 where for half the game you play as Haytham, Grand Master of the Templars... and AC4 where you're a Templar for a little while. Anyways, Shay joins Templars, effortlessly kills the Assassins, which again needs to happen because if you've played AC3, you know that all the Assassins are dead except for Achilles, Haytham shoots Achilles in the leg, that explains why he's crippled aaaand nothing really exciting happens. Its such a short game, you could complete the game in less than 5 hours if you know what to do. The only reason I didn't is because Ubisoft love to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up their games so one of the missions was glitched and I spent 2 hours fixing it. However, there is 1 exciting part. 20 years after the events of Rogue and a couple of years after the events of AC3, Shay travels to Versailles and kills Arno's father. So that explains who killed him... but here's the annoying part. Shay is no longer seen after that. This game exists to just be an explanation, its not even its own game. This could've been a big opportunity to have build a huge story, having Shay kill Charles Dorian, Arno tries to find Shay, Connor is also looking for Shay and thats the whole point of \"Unity\" to Unite Connor with Arno against Shay. It would also be the Unity of AC3, AC4, AC Rogue and AC Unity... but no, Shay is never seen again and Unity is just some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 love story. Ubisoft were really \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing lazy with this story, it makes no sense, there's no real reason for Shay to betray the Assassins and honestly the game should've just been about Haytham.\nThe gameplay is just Black Flag copied and pasted. There's barely anything new and everything which is new is not worth talking about because it rarely shows up when you play the main story.\nThe music is some of the worst I've ever heard along with Unity and Syndicate's soundtrack. Sure the title screen music is nice, but its just the Ezio theme from AC2, the British Empire from AC4 and the AC3 theme combined. Woah, how original. Yeah this is when Ubisoft started abusing the Ezio theme.\nThis game overall is just one of the worst AC games I've ever played, its so boring, the gameplay is just copied and pasted, but Black Flag was more fun than this, it ends up being disappointing, especially when you play AC Unity after this. You expect something amazing from the 3 games that built this huge story, but no you get a love story which is absolute\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 The game is\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665easy. If you've played any AC game, you will beat this in no time... and while I'm glad its better optimised than AC4, its still just one of the worst AC games ever. If you want an AC game, play any other AC game except Unity, 2014 was the worst year for AC and both games released were\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Thankfully, since this review is in 2017... we have AC Origins already and it makes up for any of the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665from 2014 - 2015.", "hours": 6.9, "username": "Alta\u00efr", "products": 59, "early_access": false}

In addition to the ship upgrades and battles, looting warehouses and conquering forts/gang HQs are a different experience. It offers a few things reminiscent of previous AC versions.\nFor example, lightning assassin strikes like in Revelations, the usual search for items to unlock a native and Templar outfit, renovating buildings to get income like in AC II, Brotherhood and Unity, etc. My least favorite activity were the assassin interventions, it was the same thing over and over and way too frantic. Unlocking the computers at the Abstergo office was much easier. I did miss the underwater exploration with the beautiful color offered by Black Flag.\nOverall, I think it\u2019s an OK Assassin\u2019s Creed game, but it certainly does not take the place of AC II or Black Flag. I didn\u2019t think I could side with the Templars but the reason for doing so was valid. However, the main plot, in my opinion, is weak, and just not captivating. There was not a great buildup to the ending. There are times when the camera movements are very \u201cwonky\u201d such as in the bar fights to unlock taverns and in defending the ship. Using the pucklegun is awkward. The scenery is not as pretty as in Black Flag, but the icebergs are a new twist. It\u2019s interesting enough to buy the game (although when it goes on sale it would be a much better value).\nI enjoy replaying great AC games, and have played AC II, Brotherhood and Black Flag numerous times. Will I replay Rogue? Like Unity, which also had a weak plot and other problems, not likely for quite some time.

It came to PC a few months. Set in the 1750s in North America it features Shay Patrick Cormac, an assassins turned templar as the protagonist. That's right, this game's main standout point was that you played it from a Templar point of view.\nAs interesting as being a Templar sounds, it doesn't really change the story in any way from previous AC games. There's first civilization relics to hunt and enemy agents to assassinate. Admitedly, it does a good job of bridging the gaps between AC Black Flag, AC 3 and even AC unity. Especially the ending really sets the stage for AC3 and it's nice to see Achilles' backstory, even if not featured very prominently. However, the story lacks any sort of interesting or strong characters that Black Flag or even AC3 had. None of the characters are interesting. Not even Haytham Kenway (who does indeed appear in this) managed to catch my interest. He wasn't the authoritative man from AC3 that gave you a unique view of the Templar vs Assassin war, he was just another quest giver telling you 'go kill x, go retrieve y.'\nAs for gameplay, the game is an odd mix of Black Flag and AC3. It has an open ocean to explore (this time the North Atlantic) and a ship to sail, the Morrigan, giving you all the privateering joyfullnes of Black Flag. But it also has the city of New York, where you are doing more traditional, AC3 style, assassination missions and 'liberating the city' in the form of capturing forts and strategic places to earn income. The ocean stuff is fantastic but New York is just dull and not very interesting. Missed opportunity. As for the combat, it's exactly the same as Black Flag and 3.\nOveral, I feel mixed about the game. Rogue tries to be both Black Flag and AC3 at the same time. It shines when it tries to be the former, but feels very dull and just painful when it tries to be the latter. The story is nice to see but very short and the main cast of characters not very interesting. But I'd still recommend it for diehard AC fans as it does expand the story and I still had fun playing it, despite it's frustrations. For newcomers, just skip it.

You might be minding your own business, trying to explore the world you are in and enjoy the open world, and these stupid annoying hags jump out and stab you. It drops your health down and it has the annoying side effect of getting soldiers to notice you and start attacking you. It doesn't matter if you're running, walking, whatever -- the stalkers can jump out and get you at any time. And you have to constantly hear their stupid whispering. If it was once in a while, ok, but they come out and get you constantly. It's ruining the game for me. My favorite thing about Black Flag was just running around and exploring and I can't do that anymore.\n2. This game is really buggy.

Without sailing about in a pirate ship, exploring all the little islands and villages in the West Indies and boarding and capturing every enemy ship out of sheer malice, you\u2019d just have\nbut with actual characters. As such,\n\u2019s setting was also tied directly to the core of what the game was. So here\u2019s a fun question: how could you do a quick, cheap reskin of\nin a different setting without making the naval component seem utterly redundant? Ubisoft Sofia has the answer with\n, a project dumped on them by the big boys in Montreal who were busy working on the\nthat the actual effort went into in 2014,\n. While technically a good way of ensuring you get a metric \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ton of money from every source possible, the result is a game which has a lot of trouble actually using its engine to the fullest capability. For starters, we\u2019re in the French and Indian War of the late 1750s, mostly in the area surrounding New York. If you\u2019re thinking that pre-revolutionary New York must be a god-awful setting for a\n-style open world, you\u2019d be right, which is why it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re also given a largely irrelevant section of the North Atlantic to sail around in (seriously, you go here like twice for story missions and that\u2019s it). While colder than the Caribbean sea, the North Atlantic doesn\u2019t offer any incentive to explore unless you really like sheets of ice and walking around the same shipwreck over and over. For the most part the story keeps us in the Hudson River valley, and if that also seems like a pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 setting for a\n-style open world, it\u2019s because it is. The valley\u2019s layout means you\u2019ll be spending half your time checking the world map for the correct war through this labyrinthine river to your next objective and the other half trying to turn the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing boat around. Yes,\n\u2019s open world is much more\nthan\n, meaning the open world is more to introduce a commute between missions than any form of enhancement.\nAwful, shoehorned open world design aside,\nputs us once again in the shoes of a modern-day office worker employed at Abstergo Entertainment, who we know as a front for the descendants of the Knights Templar. The game, however, treats this as a big plot twist. Seriously, the twist at the end is that Abstergo is run by Templars, and I don\u2019t feel bad spoiling this because it\u2019s less of a twist and more the concept for the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing game. Anyway the Abstergo building is the same one from\nexcept this time a virus found in the memories of the Irish-American assassin Shay Cormac has corrupted all the servers and the place has been evacuated, probably to save money on ambient voice acting. Naturally we\u2019re mandated by a big angry man and his \u201890s sidekick to keep digging through Shay\u2019s memories to find something (we aren\u2019t told what until the end) and thus we get to the actual game part of the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing game. An angsty, obnoxious man with equally annoying facial hair, Shay spends the early sequences aiding the Assassin-allied French against the British and assassinating some Templars on the side in order to steal the Voynich manuscript (it\u2019s equally indecipherable and useless here as it is in real life). Shay goes about his duties with a bad attitude and some unfunny remarks until an expedition to Portugal accidentally causes the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, practically levelling the city and trivialising the millions of lives historically lost. Shay is naturally furious at his boss for this incident he could have had no way of predicting and turns against the Assassins. Before long he\u2019s picked up by the Templars and their fantastic recruiting department and we\u2019re back to doing exactly the same stuff we were doing before but without a hood. From this point on it\u2019s basically Ubisoft circlejerking over their last few games, with prominent appearances from Haytham Kenway (the only actual character from\n), Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9 from\nand Achilles, the cranky old guy from\n, here seemingly played by Lando from The Empire Strikes Back. If this is enough to get you excited I would suggest suppressing that excitement, because none of these characters do anything significant besides simply appearing. There are also smaller cameos, like that of James Cook (still too long of a cameo), George Washington (REMEMBER HIM FROM\nGUYS? REMEMBER) and Benjamin Franklin, who sometimes pops up to massively propel the plot and then disappears again (he accidentally starts the French Revolution in this).\nYou\u2019ll often hear\ncited as the best\nstory, which is partially true. It does some things differently, and it\u2019s nice to see even a minor shift in the good vs. evil narrative that Ubisoft won\u2019t stop spinning. It\u2019s just too bad that without the fan service,\n\u2019s story is \u2018running in place\u2019 narrative that the franchise keeps doing. We stab a few baddies, the twist is they were our friends all along, and the biggest surprise you\u2019re going to get is how much you\u2019ll be hanging around poisonous gas. Seriously, between the grenade launcher that shoots gas bombs and the whole level where you\u2019re chasing a lady who keeps dropping gas (poetic, I know) you can really tell the developers were starved for something new to put in. There\u2019s a lot to rag on\nfor, but it did do some fun things. Walking through New York City you\u2019ll sometimes be ambushed by Assassins trying to get the jump on you, either by hiding in haystacks and bushes or just jumping on you from a roof. The gang outposts you can raid throughout the world are fun too, especially when the gang leader is always a highly-trained Assassin who have to first find and then kill. The leaders always have a bunch of different tools that make them actually fun to fight and lend a flavour of difficulty to a game that\u2019s otherwise never challenging on a meaningful level.\nis, however, way too conservative with these guys, and once you\u2019ve cleared all the outposts they don\u2019t come back, and neither will any motivation you had to be in New York. In general\nreally does just fail to take off. It\u2019s essentially a very short, linear game with an open world built around it that doesn\u2019t matter or influence it in any way. Same story, same gameplay, but this time there\u2019s no reason to get invested in any of it.", "hours": 20.6, "username": "Oke'd", "products": 626, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

If you liked Black Flag (as I'm sure you've read in nearly every other review) you'll like this addition just as much, if not, more as it is similar to BF in nearly every aspect.  Rogue was created in a hurry before the release of AC: Unity, which did not include \"older\" generations of consoles - entitiled fanbois weren't happy, so they scrapped together Rogue for release on older platforms to help appease the masses, hence it's near identical structure of BF.  That doesn't take away from Rogue's fun.\nRogue tells the story of an Assassin turned Templar, Shay Cormac, while tying in the stories of AC 3, Black Flag, and Unity creating a good bridge between the games.  The events that make Shay turn to the 'dark side' are sketchy and ill-conceived at best.  They don't make sense with EVERYTHING else in the whole series that defines what an Assassin is, but if you just run with it, it doesn't detract from the story (if you swap any mentions of 'Assassins' and 'Templars', the story is a typical AC story).\nThe 'brand new' combat system is glitchy, leading to several \"WTF\" moments while fighting and executing baddies, but those glitches are rare.  Rogue excels at one of the things that made me fall in love with Black Flag - Naval combat!  It's equal parts AC game as it is \"18th-century naval combat simulator\" (as explained by another review) and it improves on Black Flag's pirating in nearly every way.\nThe story is short (you can complete it within hours) but nearly 40 hours later, I'm almost completed with doing ALL the other things available in the world.  Check out my playtime - you'll see Rogue is definately the shortest of all the AC games, but it's one of the most fun.\nI can't wait for AC: Origins, and after playing all the other AC's (including the handheld titles), I'm really glad I found Rogue on sale for so cheap a few weeks ago - it's a welcome addition to my AC catalog.\ntl;dr - get it, it's fun.

He just wasn't all that interesting, the story he carries and the things he did could have been brought out better if put into the right emotions. The character itself just didn't have much emotion, he betrayed and killed his friends the only people he's known and it was tragic but the character never actaully showed any remorse just justification for trying to save the world. 8/10 Story\nVisually the game looked great, a lot of people will\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665on it looking worse than Black Flag, I simply took it as a copy paste of ACIII done right.

If you aren't within the fan base this game could easily be a huge dissapointmeant from misleading trailers and being a redo of what ACIII could have been if it had focused more on Naval Combat. This game is more close to ACIII than AC4 simply for the reason that AC4 was focused on being Pirates while this game was focused on a story that fortunately included Naval Combat and the same settings as AcIII.

Worth picking up if you enjoyed Black Flag and fancy some more\nI feel Rogue was a bit overlooked given it was released around the same time as Unity. Like Black Flag, Rogue carries on with the pirate theme this time taking the setting to the New York area and North Atlantic. As I enjoyed all the pirate related stuff from BF I really enjoyed more of it which Rogue has plenty of. It also improves a bit on BF with new weapons such as the really useful dart gun and less annoying missions like the eavesdropping ones from BF.\nThe story is also pretty good with the main character Shay, who starts off as an Assassin, turning his back on the Order and joining the Templars. Its actually quite refreshing to get the Templars perspective and the game is better for that.\nOnly downsides is some of the voice acting. Shay is supposed to have an Irish accent but what we get is an \"Oirish\" accent on par with Tom Cruises effort in Far and Away. It's brutal. Another character seems to go between Scottish and Russian. It's hard to take the story seriously at times when you have this unintended comedy.\nBut that aside Rogue is a great entry to the series and it didnt get as much attention as it deserved.If you enjoyed Black Flag then Rogue is well worth a try.", "hours": 21.5, "username": "Del Mingus", "products": 1094, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 31, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-09-16", "text": "When Rogue was first released, it was often overlooked due to Unity's release corresponding with it. However, this is definitely not a game to overlook in the Assassin's Creed franchise. AC Rogue takes place during the Seven Years' War and acts as a sequel to Black Flag, as well as a prequel to AC 3.\nThe basic story is that Shay Cormac sees first hand how dangerous the American Brotherhood is and fears they're destroying the world they wish to save. Shay is then betrayed by the Brotherhood and finds friends in the Templars. Together, they attempt to tear down the American Brotherhood before it's too late. The overall story is absolutely amazing! This is definitely one of the best things going for Rogue. The story is unique and not really one we've gotten in any other AC game. It provides perspective on the franchise. Personally, I think this is the best story we've gotten since the Ezio trilogy.\nOne thing that fans were upset with when this was announced was that this game is only 6 sequences long (with an epilogue). I don't really consider this a negative aspect though. Sure, it's the shortest AC game (besides Chronicles, but who cares about those?). A story doesn't have to be long to be good, it just has to cover everything it needs to cover and not throw in useless stuff just to add length. Rogue does this well.\nA story is nothing without its characters, and this game has a great cast. For starters, the main character, Shay, is a great character. His struggle and story are fantastic and very entertaining. The other characters joining him are all pretty darn good, and you get to see familiar faces from Black Flag and AC 3, along with new faces. None of the characters seemed out of place and they all were well-voiced.\nIn terms of game mechanics, there's nothing really new. The game's naval combat is pretty much exactly like Black Flag, but this isn't a problem since Black Flag had some amazing naval combat. Your ship, the Morrigan, is a lot more maneuverable that the Jack Daw and it has 'puck guns', but other than that, there's not much of a difference. You can fire canon balls at ships to either sink them or incapacitate them. Once you stop them in their tracks, you can board the ship, take out some fools, and decide what to do with the ship. You can either repair the Morrigan, salvage the ship, or remove your wanted level. The wanted level is determined by how many ships you sink. If you sink enough, a bounty hunter ship will come after you. These are usually about the same level your ship is and are easy to take down. Ships with higher levels than you are, of course, harder to take down. You can also upgrade your ship with loot collected from, well, looting.\nBesides bashing up boats, you can also stab some soldiers. The combat is pretty much Black Flag's combat. You can counter hits, shoot people with pistols/a rifle, stab people with swords/daggers/the hidden blades, and so one. One new addition to the weapons however is the air rifle. Despite it being a reskin of the blow dart gun in AC 4, it's pretty cool! You can put guards to sleep or make them go berserk. Later in the game, you get a grenade launcher added onto it, which is fantastic. Guards are also nothing really new. You have your standard soldiers, snipers, swordsmen, and the big brute guys. Basically the same line-up from AC 4 and AC 3. The game isn't really challenging, but then again, most AC games aren't. (Sure, there are more difficult parts here and there, but it's nothing some grinding won't cure)\nSince this is an open world game, you can travel to numerous ports, attack forts, and explore. The map is pretty darn large and there are numerous places to explore (including Sleepy Hallow!). The game looks pretty great and ran very smoothly. The graphics aren't next gen like Unity, but they get the job done. The soundtrack is also great, but the main theme is basically Ezio's Family.\nOverall, there are those who don't like the fact that this game doesn't do much of anything new with gameplay mechanics, or like that the game is about 10 hours long. Look past this and just enjoy the story and the characters. I definitely recommend this game! Check out the previous ones first, but this one is definitely one of the best AC games we've gotten since Revelations.", "hours": 12.5, "user_id": "76561198153716024", "username": "Space", "products": 187, "found_funny": 5, "early_access": false}

Assassins wont \"stalk\" you, they just stand in specific ambush locations, and come after you if you step near them, they are just human booby traps, and once you recognize this, it becomes a joke. The map is far worse than AC4, being broken into 3 smaller maps, the riverlands being the absolute worse, gone is the feeling of sailing the open seas, hello feelings of everything being incredibly small!\nHunting is...completely broken, infuriatingly so. Animals dont respawn until you reload the area entirely, and when they do, its static spawns, you are lucky to get 1-2 of your chosen hunting target. This problem wasnt present and AC4, and in AC4 you usually only needed 2 pelts of each animal, in Rogue you will need anywhere between 5-8 of a pelt, and this goes for the harpooning targets too, its a massive time consuming chore.\nThe outfit variety is great, AC4's outfits were a huge letdown, with Kenway only having a handful of outfits, and few of them any good. Shay has a massive wardrobe of very stylish outfits, however...the unlock system is utterly abysmal.\nA large portion of outfits and weapons are unlocked by completing collectables, which will take you the course of the entire game and then some to do, meaning 1) you will have already purchased the superior \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Sword, the second best weapon in the game, long before unlocking these inferior weapons 2) You will be both finished, and burned out on the game, with no options for New Game+ to enjoy your unlocks on a subsequent playthrough.\nAlso the best weapon in the game requires completing every. single. fleet mission in the game. There are 33 of them, and they each take 2-3 hours.\nYou still have a host of other problems the assassins creed series has always had, including imprecise free-running, where your character just wont make the obvious jump. Ill also have problems where enemies will attack me while im in a kill animation I cant cancel out of, or during a small cutscene where I cant even see my character.\nThe legendary ships is perhaps the most disapointing aspect of the game. There are 3 of them, two of them are the same ship, a boring normal Man of War with a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ton of health with different adds (one has normal adds, the other has fireship suicide bombers) and a repeat of one of the AC4 legendary ships...but with adds. The adds just make everything difficult to see and more chaotic than fun, and it completely falls flat.\nOverall I found the game enjoyable, but a lot of its problems greatly hurt it. Its worth playing if you have already played AC4 and its DLC and want more of that gameplay, but its far from being \"AC4 but better\" like many proclaim.", "hours": 46.5, "username": "Zaayl", "products": 277, "early_access": false}

Gameplay is extremely similar to Black Flag, which on the one hand is fine, as Black Flag was great, but on the other hand it does feel like a repeat.\nThe main distinguishing feature is that your assassin switches sides to the Templars, so you get to see things from their perspective. While the idea is cool (and they actually give the protagonist a good motivation to abandon his original cause), it just doesn't make much of a difference. You're still doing the same stuff, and you're still playing a likable character with strong morals. The only real differences are that you now occassionally get ambushed by assassins, and that there is a side activity where you try to prevent a target from getting assassinated.\nStory wise, the game ties AC 3, Black Flag (including Freedom Cry), and Unity together. You get to see some familiar places and faces, which is cool.\nOn to the bad stuff.\nThe game has serious quality control issues. This is absolutely disgraceful for a major company like Ubisoft. The game crashed to desktop every 15 minutes on my Windows 10 machine. This turned out to be a known issue that Ubisoft just can't be bothered to fix. (A workaround that the community found is to disable the TabletInputService service. No thanks to Ubi for that one, but it does work.) I've had to restart one mission 6 times because a target kept spawning into the ocean. I've had a checkpoint respawn me in a completely different location, requiring me to travel all across the world map to get back to the mission. I've had autotravel permanently disabled. I've had combat animations triggered without an opponent. Etc. Apart from the crash to desktop none of these were game breaking, but they shouldn't exist in a 2.5 year old title from a major company.\nOtherwise it's mainly the same old annoyances that we're familiar with from other ACs. Abstergo segments that nobody cares about. Lots of pointless collectables. Lots of \"puzzles\" that require no thought, but do take up time. Free running controls that occasionally make you jump into an abyss, or climb a random object, even though you clearly didn't want that.\nA final annoyance is that after the main mission, you are forced to sit through the entire credits sequence, with no possibility to skip. And Ubi credits are always insanely long. Hope you want to know the names of the HR manager of Ubisoft Bucharest, the \"Associate Manager, Shopper Marketing\", and \"Director, Security & Risk Management\", because you will have 18 minutes and 27 seconds of that kind of nonsense to look at.\nIn conclusion, AC Rogue is a pretty good AC, but it's very similar to Black Flag, and Ubisoft really doesn't care about customer experience.", "hours": 38.5, "username": "Fred2000", "products": 601, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Might as well pop 2-3 missions with a good explanatory cutscene and let us fly the colours.\nIt feels genuinely good to hunt assassins down, as a person who has finished all the AC franchise games (some more than one), I always hated the assassins and their own self centered understanding of truth and freedom. In the end they are just some antipatic murderers who did not know what they were messing with. Meanwhile good guy Templars are just calculating, thinking, designing and keeping the order and peace. You will get to agree to that as you play along and see assassins and their cuntness.

Surely, Rogue is one of my favorites in Assassin's Creed series. I would choose Rogue for it's intensive Storyline and Combat style. Besides i loved the main protagonist called Shay Cormac. Anyways, let me share my thoughts on few aspects.\nThe story of Assassin's Creed Rogue leads the tittle itself. Because Rogue has an intensive story. Rogue reveals the story of a former assassin called Shay Cormac. You're going to explore a furious journey as Shay who gets betrayed by his creed. The story isn't about his vengeance but about his strategy and way to save the world. That's how you find yourself in an immersive journey. Actually i loved this story more than few nicer stories. That's because of perfect sequences of the storyline. Like they presented the story in a right way.\nAs always, Gameplay is the most fundamental feature of Assassin's Creed titles and so as for Rogue. I would say Rogue has kind of simple gameplay. Even parkour is spontaneous as well as combat. I guess Rogue has accurate combat mechanism. So it's kinda more amusing for me to kill every guards spontaneously. But still there are some opponents which would take some time to execute. As far as i have seen, Rogue has same gameplay mechanism as Black Flag. It's like they just changed the location and characters but same combat mechanism. Well there isn't any Level up feature for you to skill up. But you can be more deadlier and efficient if you learn the combat basic and get more solid weapons. You'll be able to purchase many types of weapons, outfit and upgrade your own ship. Also i loved the Naval fight. More opportunities to upgrade the ship at it's extent and defeat legendary ships. This would take some high time for you.\nVisuals, actually same as Assassin's Creed Black Flag. If i'm not wrong then i would say, Rogue doesn't have upgraded visuals than Black Flag. Just same visuals and same facial works. So there is nothing special about it. But still this ain't disappointing for me.\nHonestly, Assassin's Creed Rogue has some solid and iconic soundtracks just like their old titles. Elitsa Alexandrova created an intensive OST for Rogue. Like David and Goliath, Main Theme and few more lovable background score.\nObviously, i'm getting smooth and flawless performance on Intel Core i5 4590, R9 390 STRIX and 8GB Ram with maxed presets. Besides, i haven't found any bugs, errors, crashes nor stuttering. So there is nothing to reprove.\nSo peeps, Without any concerns you should try this out once in a while. You might not love it at first but later on this might become your favorite title in Assassin's Creed series. Also this worths it's price definitely.", "hours": 86.8, "username": "T'Challa", "products": 69, "early_access": false}

Berserk darts allow for methodical zero combat clearing of ridiculous numbers of enemies, and this time you're limited to two pistols.  Speaking of pistols, to get what seemed to be some of the better pistols in the game you have to collect all of an item in the real world / abstergo portions of the game, but these can only be accessed towards the very end of the story, rendering them a little pointless.\nSimilarly the better swords are locked behind the naval campaign which is a slow steady plod of waiting half an hour then starting the next mission then waiting slightly longer to start the next etc and ultimately is pretty unrewarding since the primary rewards are money.  Money is absolutely no issue in this game once you pass the point where you access the bank and renovations, in fact I wasted money deliberately by buying the vast majority of the animal items I needed for crafting and still never felt a lack of it, meanwhile I was scrounging for basic materials for ship upgrades and wishing I could just buy them to diminish my ridiculous fortune of tens of thousands of british pounds in the 1700s, likely equating to millions in modern terms.\nThe ending felt a bit rushed, we get the final abstergo sequence, a short story ending which is a bit dull and pedestrian by the standards of the rest of the game, and then credits roll (and roll, and roll, and roll if you let them, lot of people worked on this game) before you're dumped back on a dock to freeroam and finish collecting things for achievements if you so wish.\nOverall it is good, but not great.", "hours": 28.0, "username": "Fyndir", "products": 626, "early_access": false}

I feel a bit biased since I've always dreamt about a game that gave us the power to sail and wreck havoc in the seas like a true pirate and even tho Assassin's Creed Black Flag captured that essence this game feels new.\nAlso being a lore-geek the plot was well done and immersive in terms of giving you some insight into the templar side of the AC universe. There's a lot of exploring and side quests to do and this can be a good thing or a bad thing. I do enjoying hunting down every last piece of content but that's me. Once the main quest-line is done you're left with side objectives that drag you from random place to random place with not much else to do. With such an amazing system I'd like to see some online action but there's none at all so don't count on that.\nWould I recommend it? Yes!

I'll list my likes and dislikes down below\nPros:\n-The Naval combat in the North Atlantic is fun because of the ice\n-Some of the bug were fun and made me laugh.\nCons:\n-Short Story Not even five hours (PS. I was just privatering and upgrading my ship for like 14 hours and I left in on while I was Eating and watching Youtube, so that's why I have 20ish hours.)\n-Boring Story\n-Boring Characters\n-No Character development\n-Little to no effort into making the player question who the bad guy really is, because they just make the assassins look like careless morons who are willing to work with thugs.\n-Stupid ship movement, That meaning the man of wars turn way to quickly and the Storm Fortress turns faster than your ship which makes no sense. Maybe Templar Technology?\n-Game breaking bugs. I had a bug where an assassination target who T pose and fly around while shooting making is nearly impossible to kill him.\n-Waves break the camera. I couldn't see anything while fighting in storms and was shooting blindly hoping to hit, and that goes to another point\n-Overly easy naval combat. Now don't get me wrong I love the naval combat, but it required no effort at all to win battles. An example was when I fought two man of wars with almost no upgrades and won. The exception being the Storm Fortress but that's not hard its just broken to make it hard.\n-Broken Controls. Now you may be thinking is nit piking, cause anyone who's played an AC game will know the controls are terrible, but this was just horrendous, I would lose fights because I couldn't counter attacks because it wasn't registering me hitting the key even though I did, and I would be climbing and I would just jump off a tower and kill myself.\nThat about it, this was not worth 15 bucks (I got it on sale.) and I think it should of been a dlc for BF anyways that it.\nSorry for any terrible grammer or spelling im writing this at 4 and I'll be far too lazy to edit it later.\nI'm also \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.", "hours": 23.3, "username": "ExpressingHate", "products": 307, "early_access": false}

For instance the game uses mechanics from AC4 and textures and models from AC3 so it does not feel original and most of the off the beaten path  feel generic to the point you won't remember any of them. Further the game felt more glitchy compared to past AC games, with great examples like a Man O'War disappearing when I moved up to board it, or crew on my ship on more than one occasion flying off, and so on. I normally expect a few weird things to occur in an open world game, but in Rogue it felt testing may not have had enough time to iron things out.\nStill the biggest sin I have against the game is that the main character does not feel like a real person - he feels like some sort of one demension villian from a movie or saturday morning cartoon. He and other characters do not act like rational human-beings throughout the game as it feels like they are being forced to make irrational decisions to fit a broken narrative.\nAll the negatives aside, I must repeat it has the same mechanics as AC4, so you'll get more of the same, but AC4 & AC3 are better storywise and gameplay so I just cannot recommend Rogue when players have those at their disposal. If nothing else if you have finished AC 3 & 4 I would recommend AC: Freedom Cry over Rogue as it shares the same mechanics as AC4, and even though it is a shorter story than Rogue the story of Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9 is stronger and more belivable than Shay.", "hours": 69.8, "user_id": "76561197967065436", "username": "Canadianmonster", "products": 253, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 48, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-04-25", "text": "Assassin's Creed Rogue was pretty good. I actually liked it more than I was expecting to. And I think that is largely because of the varying ways you can explore the world. I can't say if I liked it more than Unity or not, as the story is pretty short. If you're not doing any of the side content, naval missions, running around and clearing areas of Assassin gangs, the story could probably be beat in just under six hours. But because it's just like the more recent Assassin's Creed gangs, where there's various side quests and all of this exploring and collecting treasures, you can spend a lot of time playing this game. I got to the point where I did tire myself from constantly going from location to location, collecting treasures, sea shanty lyrics, prosperity (raises your income), renovating buildings, treasure maps, and I think it's because they tried to fill in as much as they could. It just got repetitive after a while. It would have been nice if Ubisoft actually utilized all of these locations they'd made for the seperate worlds instead of just throwing them there and adding all of these collectables. Outside of the main story, some of these locations are completely pointless and don't require a second visit. That's my main issue with this game, the surmounting amount of locations that are ultimately irrelevant.\nThe story is pretty good. I liked it. I liked the different perspective of how treacherous the Assassins can be, how they'll want to stop the Templars by any means, and to secure the precursor items even if it means destroying a city. That's how Shay Cormac ends up betraying the Assassins; after he's sent to Lisbon to acquire a precursor box, the great Lisbon earthquake of 1751 happens, and the destruction is similar to how it actually did happen in real life. The entire city's infrastructure is destroyed and lopsided, and it angers Shay. After being shot in the back by his fellow Assassins, he falls off a cliff and is left for dead. But the Templars save him and nurture him back to health. Although the Templars can be ruthless, it shows that they do show sympathy and empathy. The story is also great as it covers, at least it tries to cover, the French-Indian War of the 1750's. They could have done a better job of referring to some of the missions and campaigns though. If you do take over the number of forts in the North Atlantic and the River Valley, then you do get a perspective of how it was mostly a naval war, but defeating those forts is pretty much optional. The main story doesn't require it. Still, I did nearly everything, defeated every fort, went to every viewpoint.\nThe world's design, well, I have complaints. The north Atlantic is okay. They at least tried to design Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and the southern shore of Quebec, and the various small islands in the area. But it's scaled down so much and the only relevant areas are, more or less, Halifax, St. John's, and Anticosti, plus some of the wilderness areas. It's not and the area is quite big in terms of square miles, not as big as the West Indies in Black Flag, obviously, but still kind of big. The textures are nice. I definitely liked the weather system. It was a lot better than the River Valley area, which was my biggest complaint in this game. I don't know who laid out that area, but they should be fired. I've never seen something so dumb. It's a stupid combustion of river valley land in a square, that ranges from Mount Vernon, Virginia, to southern Quebec. None of that makes sense. Mount Vernon is directly west of Sleepy Hollow, NY. And Sleepy Hollow is basically just west-south-west of Albany, NY. Who designed this? I live not to far from the Genesee river and have explored most of its length and I can tell you that the Genesee region shown in the game looks nothing like how it should. There are high mountains in what should be the Catskills, but the Catskills look nothing like how they do in the game. Hell, they threw in some landmarks on some made up geography in scattered locations, some of them cities that aren't accurate to history, and called it a day. This is basically the opposite of what Ubisoft does for their other games. They've at least attempted to treat cities with some historical accuracy. What they did in the River Valley was a joke. It's not like the story in the River Valley part was bad, just awful design.\nOverall, this game was good, but not great. 7.9/10", "hours": 47.9, "user_id": "76561198009430218", "username": "JacoRay", "products": 774, "early_access": false}

I was somewhat enthousiastic as the game downloaded on Steam.\nThen I played, and played some more. And well, I guess this is the AC that's too much for me. There are so many things wrong with this game that I don't even know where to start.\nThe gameplay is\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 It always has been, even after Unity and Syndicate pitiful attempts at improvings things. Fighting is a joke, a QTE that doesn't say his name. Normal enemy? Push E when he attacks. Big tough guy? Hit space. And, ffs, haven't those four archetypes of soldiers been around since, I don't know, AC 2 or 3?\nWhy is my character, that irish no-name with the charisma of an oyster, still running everywhere except on the ground? If I want to go from my cabin to the wheel of my ship, why is he jumping onto guns, barrels, or even other people, and not sticking to the floor? I mean, I get that AC is about climbing stuff, but why, 8 years or so after AC1, is climbing still so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665? Why does Tomb Raider gets it right immediatly, when Ubisoft still can't offer us a half decent parkour?\nWhy do you have to fill your game with useless and grindy content?

Here, I'm just trying to fill up a bar that says \"Syncronization: 67%\".\nThe rest, the biased vision of history (\"booh at those evil french\", laughable when you know that a) the French were much less devious than the Brits during the 7 years war, and b) that Ubisoft is a french company that doesn't even try to not present a \"history for anglo saxon dummies\" point of view), the terrible dialogues... That's the icing on the cake, that I'd be willing to forget if the rest of the game was fun and interesting.\nMind you, all of this isn't new. Past AC games had the same flaws. And then some more.

If we didn't have the First Civ and current day Animus Technology in game, I think this game would lack relevance to the current day player, and we'd feel like we were just playing a historical \"Kill 'Em\" game.\nThis game took me from start to finish 17 hours, including some moderate grinding. For comparison, I've played through Assassin's Creed 2 3 total times on Steam (not including xbox before PC Master Race), and full completion took 20 hours each time. Game time spent, I'm very happy, because I got it on sale for $9.99, the only time you should really buy this game, IMO. At full price, you don't get anywhere near as good value.\nThe sailing was mostly the same as AC4, no super noticeable changes. The parkour/free running was mostly the same as AC4, felt good. The actual map exploration I ended up doing was next to none. AC4 revealed the map in way better time, and provided much better incentive to easily explore areas. There are whole areas of New York, for example, that I haven't even set foot in, and if story had even taken us through it once, I would have likely cleared it, or at least synchronized in that area.\nTL;DR: Game was good, but don't buy it at full price.

The story line is way too short and if you just do that you miss 50% of the content, which is what I did the first time through.  The second time through I spent more time on side missions and extra story lines and still managed to end the game only finishing ~75% of the content.  Which brings me to my gripe:  the ending, which is not very epic IMO, signals the end of the game.  That's it.  No continuation if you feel like going back and finishing side quests and such, it's just over.  So if you want to see how some of those things end, you have to start all over.  Well I've played through twice and it was a good investment with plenty of entertainment so money well spent.  But I won't be playing it again as it is a bit too much like grinding to finish the quests with a lot of repetition.  How many different cool ways are there to kill the enemy before it gets old?  I'd say about 537 which is an easy number to reach in this game.  And the ship gets way too powerful in the end for any enemy to offer any real resistance so it just becomes a game of dropping a mortar on anyone you want disabled and using the puckle gun to finish them off instead of all that tedious boarding action.  I don't care how many upgrades and guns you put on a frigate, a man o' war gonna drop yo\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665if you dumb enough to tangle with one.  Not in this game.  At least make it challenging.  Shae's upgrades are a waste of time, or at least not important enough to try and find all the animals you need to make the upgrades.  The first time through I forgot all about them because his defaults were sufficient to do whatever I needed to do.  I did upgrade his weapons and armor but again, once you've done that to the max (without quest weapons) you don't need to do anything else and you'll be fine.  The accuracy rating on the pistols doesn't mean anything and I can do a head shot at max range with any of them, even the default pistols.  The only significant difference I found upgrading my weapons was with my sword.  And once you've upgraded your sword 3-4 levels the killing becomes ridiculously easy.

It's definitely worth a playthrough if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed. The best way to describe how this game fits into this story would be like how Revelations was fit into Ezio's Story: It's a thing that's there and it's kind of nice to have but it doesn't have much pertinenece to the story as a whole.\nI like to say that while Unity got all the programmers, Rogue got the story writers.The gist of the story is that you're an assassin that went rogue and now fight for the Templars. Woo. Though the premise is simple the characters actually have more depth than a brick wall and it makes for some really interesting sequences. At some point in the game I was emotionally attached to a person I would eventually have to kill, and the dialogue really helped to drive those feelings.\nI do have to note though that all of the assassins are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s to you even when you're on their side, and the first  friendly character in the entire game is the guy that recruits you to be a Templar.\nSo the engine was beefed up a bit as the water actually ripples as things fall into it or whales breach the surface, and these ripples can be used to damage enemy ships. The addition of Icebergs gives more strategy to naval combat, but the higher success rate of pointing all your cannons at the enemy ship, kind of nulls that.\nLike most Assassin's Creed games, you are armed to the teeth  and there's more weapons than there are number buttons on the keyboard. Although I appreciate having variety, the pistols, sleep darts, berserker darts, and shrapnel gernades were more than enough to get through most obstacles.\nSomething they added that I liked at first was a new enemy that would sneak around and try to kill you from stealth. Whispers creep in as you get closer to them, the whispers get louder. If you get too close they run up to you from across the map and almost kill you. So you stab them. And they die. and if you happened to get hit by them, you regen health immediately. Which is why this became more of an annoyance as the game went on. I caught myself just seeing what direction they were using eagle vision, took an educated guess on their position and avoided them. It's a good idea, but it definitely needs improvement so it isn't just annoying.\nIt also has the usual collect all the goodies missions. I gave up on trying to 100% this game when I saw that there were 8 number of collectables: animus fragments, shanties, templar maps, templar artifacts that you find from the maps, letters, Viking swords, treasure chests, and prosperity. At some point I realized that I wasn't having fun collecting stuff and would rather be doing stuff that was more action packed.\nOverall, I had fun playing it. While AC4 was a pirate game with assassin elements this is definitely an Assassin Gae with Pirate elements.

You feel for Shay throughout, and if you're as open minded as myself, you may find you agree to his ideals. You're eyes and mind are opened to a new reality which sometimes begins to make the previous games feel like 'Assassin Propaganda', where you are blinded by the Assassin point of view.\nIn the present day you play an Abstergo Entertainment employee within the familiar environment of Black Flag. The employee is a nobody (or 'numbskull', as you're often dubbed), exploring the memories of another nobody called Shay Patrick Cormac - an Assassin in the 1750's. As you find out just how important Shay is to both the Assassins AND the Templars of the present and the past, you find that certain decisions you make reflect that of Shay himself: you view the world \"as it really is\".\nIn Shay's memories, he is sent on a mission which has him unexpectedly and uncontrollably involved in the literal destruction of a city. With the guilt and disgust of the innocents killed, he confronts those that sent him on the mission only to find that they won't listen. After confrontation, and events following it, Shay finds himself allied with the same people who share the same view on protecting the innocent and doing what is right. However, these allies were once his sworn enemy. Ultimately Shay must end the threat, even if he must kill those he once saw as his family.\nOverall, the stories of both times are short, but rich, and almost every character has some kind of interesting backstory, with reference to previous games, and future ones (Unity & Syndicate). They definitely could have filled certain gaps in the story where time passed such as explaining how Shay got to where he eventually gets to in the final sequence. However, everything ties in so well in an almost flawless fashion, filling the interesting gap between the transitioning protagonists of Haytham and Connor in AC 3, as well as a key moment in AC Unity. The present day is 'marmite' - a term used to describe how you either love it or hate it. I found it interesting, mainly because the unknown protagonist rises to importance in parallel to Shay as he explores Shay's memories.\nNaval Combat is slightly more flushed out and feels much more satisfying than Black Flag (and Black Flag had it spot on at the time!). The biggest and best difference is the upgrade to your round shots which fires a double volley of cannons! Another key thing is to watch out for those Bounty Hunters ramming into you. It's not something to take for granted this time around. Otherwise it's essentially the same badass naval combat unrivaled in games in my opinion.\nMelee combat and stealth kills are also essentially the same as previous games as well, so don't expect much of a noticeable difference besides the new (and cool) grenade types that have different effects. Ubisoft definitely didn't see the need to revamp the combat in this game due to doing so in Unity.\nThere is a lot to do for side content, about as much as Black Flag, with Hunting missions, Assassinations, Fort and Gang territory controls, Shay's Fleet missions, and the ever-awesome (and much improved) Legendary Ship Battles.\nThere's a number of collectibles to find across 3 maps; Animus Fragments, Chests, Prosperity gems, Shanties, Templar Maps, and more. And depending on DLC's, there is also even more to find and unlock cool content.\nYou can also earn money from a bank account after performing activities that increase your generated income. One of these activities is Renovation, which was seen in Black Flag at the Pirates Hideout. Renovating public buildings will raise your income, as will taking over Forts, Territories and collecting Prosperity gems as a new collectible.\n= Final Opinions =\nEssentially the biggest grip in this game, though, is the intrigue of the Templar point of view. At first I thought 'Yep, I'd love to be a bad guy for a change'. Sometimes bad guys are more fun, right? Well as the story hit a certain stage, I found myself seeing the Templars as peacemakers, just trying to do what's best for people and having the Assassins constantly meddling in their affairs and destroying their plans.\nBut most of all, they were being careless. Shay saw it this way and allied himself with those he was meant to kill. The very first character you meet when you try to set things right appears good-hearted and honourable, a man of a heroic and kind nature, wanting to do whats right for the people in the colonies as much as Shay does. He becomes Shay's role model, and, perhaps, you're own (if doing what you feel is right, is you're sort of thing). For me this was the biggest and most important thing; the ultimate change of opinion not only in this game, but the entire franchise.\nAlso, I find that the key requirement for atmosphere and immersion in all games is it's music and sound design. Let me tell you, at least 80% of the music is perfect. Elitsa Alexandrova is brilliant! The main theme feels so... Shay. The Legendary Battle theme (David and Goliath) is almost as epic as the track used in the Legendary Battles in Black Flag (let's face it, ya can't beat that). Chase and combat tracks are also really nicely composed. I personally found that this was the last game with a great soundtrack - Unity and Syndicate just got repetitive and annoying for me.\nSo now I ask myself something. Forget Jedi or Sith, that's so 2016. The real question to be asking is this: Assassin, or Templar?\nTemplar. Definitely Templar.\nBut then, I could just be an unknown employee from Google, my hands forced into a secret oganisation, and now I'm just spreading Templar propaganda.", "hours": 263.5, "username": "Master Templar", "products": 71, "early_access": false}

People are known to slate the game for its similiarities with Black Flag, but I honestly believe that the combat and naval mechanics in Black Flag were too good to throw away. I did indeed play Black Flag and loved it, and despite the mechanics being very similar to Rogue I still loved it to bits and there was no part in the game where it felt boring.\nThe graphics for Assassins Creed Rogue are of an A rated standard, but there are a few issues that I came across. As with Black Flag 2560x1080 was not supported despite being in the options, so I had to install a quick fix to begin playing the game, but apart from that I experienced no crashes whatsoever whilst playing this game. The only graphical issue that I had with this game was the lack of anti-aliasing that this game had. In Black Flag you had a selection of anti-aliasing options to choose from to smoothen out those jagged edges, but you only have the option to enable FXAA, which leaves rather noticeable jagged edges on objects such as rope and fences, but this isn't too noticeable on characters and will not effect your experience to a high degree. The game runs smoothly however and no stutters or lag spikes were detected.\nNow time to talk about the good 'n' juicy bits of the game. New combat mechanics were implemented such as new ship upgrades and customization options which weren't featured in Black Flag. You can have a nostalgic trip by purchasing some of the iconic ship customizations that were available in Black Flag, but other than that all of the customization options are unique, and they haven't just dumped old content into this lovely game. New naval mechanics have been added such as the ability to leave oil trails in the ocean and set fire to them to roast your enemies (Water+Oil=Fire?) and the pucker cannon can now be freely aimed, allowing you to take out poor old icebergs and take out drunken pirates who try to oppose you.\nEnemy ships can now ram into you, and begin to board your boat, so you get a taste of your own medicine in a sense, as you will be forced to defend yourself.\nYou are also not able to go to the harbour master and reset your wanted rating like you were able to in Black Flag, so the only way to escape those blasted pirate hunters is by hit and running.\nSome new weapons have been added to the game such as the shrapnel, beszerk and sleep grenades, which gives you a larger variety of ways to take out your enemies.\nFor those players out there who are into helping out lil' NPCs then you can now renovate buildings all around the world to let pirates have fun and commit debauchery.\nThe world itself is of huge scale so theres plenty of ocean for you to trek around in whilst singing shanties, but I felt that the world was rather monotonous, and besides the naval combat there wasn't really much purpose landing the anchor and exploring the world, unless you were interested in crafting. The world is beautifully designed, but the lack of interactiveness around the world and side quests meant that the only compelling part of the game was the story.\nThe story completely made this game for me, as it allows you to have a perspective from the Templars side, and their understanding on the world. The story was exhilarating to play through and the compelling protagonist made the game a delightful experience to play through. The Abstergo plot was also interesting and gives you a better insight on the Assassins Creed lore.\nThis is the second game in the AC series that I have played through and I will most certainly be playing through the next game in the series. Ubisoft definitely know how to produce a game and I respect them for putting time and effort into their games and producing content that their fans want to see, which is rare for game developers to do these days.", "hours": 43.4, "username": "Charlie Fi5hykins", "products": 143, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Serving as a prequel to AC III, Rogue explores how an Assassin initiate, Shay Cormac, turned against the Assassin Order in Colonial America and wiped out the Assassins.\nGameplay is extremely similar to AC IV Black Flag with sailing, climbing, and combat. However, Rogue adds new elements like gas grenades and icebergs to make combat amd exploration much more interesting, and it does very well mixing in these new elements. Sailing is still basically the same, so if you liked it from AC IV, then you get more of it. Renovations make a return in Rogue, using materials looted from other ships to contruct buildings to generate more income. Similar to the forts in AC III, there are gang headquarters scattered throughout the world that you can take over and use as a base of operations. Also, I found Rogue to be much more difficult overall than other Assassin's Creed games, which is a nice change of pace from always being overpowered against every other enemy.\nRogue's story is definitely one of the strongest in the series, providing a relatable character Shay, as he experiences that the Assassins aren't always the \"good guys\", and the Templars aren't always the \"bad guys\". Shay struggles as he believes in the Templar cause, but has to come to terms and fight against his former brother and sister assassins. This story fills the gap on why the Assassin Order is all but extinct during the events of AC III. Also, the modern day segments are minimal and dont' provide much new if you've played other AC games. Overall, Rogue delivers a very different story than the rest of the series, and that makes it one of the best.\nRogue keeps on par with visuals just like AC IV, but with the added ice and snow elements. The game performs smoothly with little to no visual hiccups.\nDespite having an exact replica of the AC IV exploration mechanic, navigation is much more of a hassle in Rogue. One sailing area in particular is very frustrating to navigate because it's a long winding and narrow river that just makes me want to fast travel everywhere, almost cutting out exploration.\nOverall, Rogue is a fresh new idea in the series that performs well and is definitely worth playing through. The story is drastically different and keeps the intrigue as Shay goes from Assassin to Templar. However, most people probably didn't play this game since it came out with Assassin's Creed Unity, which is highly unfortunate.", "hours": 9.2, "user_id": "76561198045131770", "username": "Noahffiliation", "products": 117, "early_access": false}

Play Rogue instead.\nSIMILAR GAMES: Assassin's Creed 4, Prince of Persia, Far Cry 3/4\nSIMILAR MOVIES: Pirates of the Caribbean, Master and Commander\nIt's a worth successor to Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. If you haven't played AC4, then you are missing out on quite possibly one of the best games ever made. I've been a long time fan and supporter of the AC franchise. I've played every single game excluding Syndicate. Up until AC4, the series followed a very familiar formula - parkour, explore the map by climbing towers and updating your map, do challenges to earn up better weapons and armor upgrades, and progress through the story by assassinating bad guys and experiencing interesting plot twists. Every new AC game featured a few new concepts but it was mostly the same formula improved just a little bit by throwing in an extra minigame and tweaking some gameplay. By AC3, gamers got tired of this recycling. In addition, the game was hit with a lot of glitches and poor optimization. The formula was completely remade with the addition of naval warfare. This was one of the greatest additions to the series and it occured by accident. Basically you have a ship and a crew and you can choose to be a pirate and raid smaller ships for supplies in order to gain loot and money which you will later use to upgrade your ship and character. And yes, the naval battles are incredible. They are so amazing that part of the game can literally be it's own stand alone game. AC4 recieved a lot of praise from gamers and reviewers solely due to this one addition. What does Ubisoft do for the sequel? Forget naval warfare ever existed and return to the world of AC3 by creating AC: Unity.\nUnity has a complete letdown both from a gameplay and technical standpoint and as a result, the last-gen \"watered down\" console port completely flew underneath my radar. I didn't hear of anyone talk about or hype up Rogue until I discovered it during a sale and boy was I glad. It managed to deliver. It brought back naval warfare from AC4 and the wilderness from AC3 as well as added a few new features such as taking over \"gang\" forts. This works like naval forts but on land. You sabotage fort supplies, assassinate a leader, and cut the flag off. Boom, you've taken over the fort and gained revenue. There's also the addition of assassin interception missions where you protect a random civilian on the streets by attempting to find and kill the assassins before they kill the civilian. Finally, no glitches and no gimmicky CoOp features. Unfortunately no multiplayer either.\nThe graphics are superb, the poor optimization of AC4 was fixed and the game runs remarkably well. I'm playing this game on a laptop GPU (670mx which is the equivalent of 560-660GTX). I had difficulties running AC4 on 1080p/low and got 20-30fps. With Rogue, I almost maxed it at 1080p and 40-50fps. So not only does the game run better but it also looks better.  Also, I strongly recommend a 360 controller for this. I love the KB&M but this is one of those few games where controller is actually superior. Multiple buttons are pushed at once and you need the precision of an analog stick to turn your ship. KB&M wouldn't be as comforting but it's doable.\nOverall, I recommend this game especially for $20. If AC4 was AC2: Brotherhood (which was the highlight of the Ezio saga), then Rogue would be like AC: Revelations. It didn't expand on much but it offered the same great gameplay and content if you were hungry for more. I picked it up for $10 and I got my money's worth. Don't bother with the time saver DLC - the farming in this game isn't that bad. The only real DLC - Templar Legacy - is decent but there's more then enough content in the main game to hold you over.  There's approximately 20-30 hours worth of content. If you enjoyed AC4 and were wanting more after Unity disappointed you, this game is for you and I urge you to pick it up. If you didn't enjoy AC4, then you might not enjoy Rogue. Also be warned, this game uses UPlay which is Ubisoft's digital distribution manager. It's not the best thing in the world but it works.", "hours": 26.8, "username": "Swaggaccino", "products": 469, "early_access": false}

Take a couple of weeks off from playing Black Flag - you're likely to forget the story when you start it up again. Rogue is all-involving. The plot is a lot more personal. It does something that no other AC game has done before... and shows the story from the BAD GUY point of view. Not only that, but it does it in a way that makes YOUR character a good guy (well, as good as a guy can be when he's a member of a top secret murder cult) while still ticking all the bad guy tropes. Best of all, it actually SHOWS the good guys (again, murder cult) the heroes - as villains without MAKING them villains. This whole story - by and large - is a series of misunderstandings. Arrogance.

If you stand too close when he opens his mouth you can smell the guinness. Trust me. He's Irish. He's full of energy and fun and he'd like to kick the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665of over half the members of the brotherhood. He's arrogant - but he's got a reason to be arrogant. At the start of the story he's one of their best recruits - and as the story goes on he's one of the ONLY characters who seems to retain some kind of common sense. When the head of his top secret murder cult orders him to steal an artifact that costs millions of people their lives - you'd THINK said head of a top secret murder cult would be smart enough to leave well enough alone. But no, the French and the British and the Native American's are breathing down the throats of both the Templars and the Assassin's and it's up to the boss man (aka the head of the top secret murder cult) to track down MORE artifacts. Your character has an objection to this - and from there the whole story spirals out of control with your character struggling to (literally) keep the world in one piece the only way he knows how... by killing everyone he ever cared about.  Over the course our story the Irish ball of fun loses his sense of humor. He loses his innocence. He loses everyone and everything he ever cared about. He becomes a Templar. Utterly. His last act of humanity is to spare Mr. Big (aka the boss man aka the head of the top secret murder cult) which eventually leads to the events of AC3 - but wait! There's more! Another game was developed alongside Rogue (ACU) and the player's last act as the main character ties into the FIRST ACT of Unity. Tying together not JUST Black Flag and AC3 but the future games themselves.\nThe combat is the same as all AC games have ever been. Seriously. If you don't like AC combat then you're going to be upset with this game. Again, as with every AC game, there's on or two bells and whisles that have been added in to make your experience a bit more unique - but it's still the AC combat we've all come to know.\nThere's even less to say about the crafting in this game than there was in AC3 and Black Flag. There's even less outfits you can craft in this game. The upgrades are nice but - again - as the requirements can all be bought and then crafted - the actual foraging aspect of the crafting feature can be completely ignored.\nThe map is easily as big (if not slightly bigger) than Black Flag but it does this in a very sneaky way. Instead of having a HUGE ocean to play in - you have three medium sized maps. You have the ocean to play in. Rivers to play in and New York City to play in. Best of all, unlike AC3, New York actually feels fleshed out. It actually feels like a city with districts and people living in it. There is no diving this time - but you won't really miss it (if you tried it in Black Flag and hated like I did you'll actually be glad it's gone) or probably even notice it's gone.\nThe ship combat has actually been re-refined. Gone are those (near useless) barrels (well, almost gone, anyway) and in their place we have an oil slick that makes it VERY tricky for an enemy to come too close or (even stupider) try to follow you. Further, in place of the limited-use flintlock guns strapped to your ship, you have a puckle gun. This weapon is FUN. It's basically a flintlock machine gun (look it up, this was an ACTUAL historical weapon) that can fire off twelve shots before needing reloading. On the open sea an enemy ship can attack you - you can be pulled down and dragged into combat when you aren't ready for it. Black Flag may have made the ship combat enjoyable - but Rogue makes it an art form.\nAC Unity is embarrassment - even after all this time. Rogue came out at the same time and was - sadly - overshadowed by the media attention Unity got. Unlike Unity - Rogue was WORTH full price at launch and is STILL worth it. It is WORTH the hours and time you put into it. The story is good. The combat is the same as ever and you'll feel satisfied when it's all over. If you like pirates and ninjas and good-old-fashioned 'Merican cameos (hey Ben! Captain Cook! Woo!) then make your own luck and give this game a try.", "hours": 74.3, "user_id": "76561198054510467", "username": "shadowfaxe7", "products": 94, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

Play this. Recently, AC has made people worried about glitchy, unplayable games. This is one of the most polished games in the series.\nWhat's new in this version: You play as a Templar for most of the game, so you have to dodge assassins for the last third of the game. That means you'll bewalking around and an assassin will jump out of a bush, or off a roof, and they'll do pretty heavy damage if they hit.  There are also sidequests to protect people who are getting targeted by a bunch of assasins. Both of these new things are fun, and appreciatied. They also made all of the shiny collectibles easier to get. There were very very few collectibles that were frustrating to get, and I think I 100% all of the shiny things.\nBut it still has some of the old problems: You also still have the overpowered blow gun from AC3, but now it's an air gun. But now you have a grenade launcher to go with it. Shrapnel grenades, sleep grenades, beserk grenades. I didn't enjoy this. AC has had a problem where it acts like a stealth game, but it doesn't always play like one. This has gotten worse as the series as progressed. If you are mediocre at brawlers, you can fight off about as many enemies as they can throw at you. There aren't a lot of rewards for actually sneaking, or for avoiding killing anyone.

However instead of the West Indies, with their Tropical Climate, you get two areas with a diffrent climate zone each to explore with your ship The river valley and the North Atlantic (I'd say both of these combined are a bit smaller than the carribean sea in AC4, but offer more variety in terms of visuals). When it comes to overall ammount of content, it's a bit less than the before mentioned, but should still last for a good 12 hours. (This is only following the main questline, without straying from the path to much by doing side activities. I'd guess you can easily spend 40-50 hours if you do all the side activities aswell).\nThe gameplay remains the same for the most part, with a few exceptions: For examples Enemy ships can now also attempt to enter your ship, instead of it only beeing possible the other way around. On land there are now assassins trying to hunt you down. This works simular to the multiplayer mode featured in previous AC games. In terms of gadgets, you get pretty much everything you got in AC4 with the addition of a grenade launcher that can fire 3 diffrent types of grenades. (berserk, sleep, and standard frag grenades) Other than that everything remains the same.\nFor once the Story is actually beeing told from the opposite side: The Templars. And puts a bit more light on the motives behind their actions. Rather than them just beeing the bad guys that want to control the world. I'd say it's a interesting story that fills the timeline of the AC-Universe with events between AC4 and AC3, aswell as AC:U.\nSo basicly I think if you like other AC Games, you'll like this one.

I can not have imagined, nor believed what I was missing, until I have watched the final cutscene, at 4 in the morning, unable to stop playing until I saw it. Rogue to me, very simply put, is extremely surprising. Not since Ezio could I enjoy a playable character quite like Shay Patrick Cormac. A man simply seeking to do the right thing from the start until the end. After experiencing a very traumatic event done by his own hand, he turned his back on the Assassin Brotherhood, blaming his mentor, a young Achillies Davenport (From AC3) for what transpired. For attempting to conspire against them, they attempted to kill Shay, who was rescued hours before his certain demise by the Templar Order. The very same Order you spend game after game, hour after hour, fighting against. Rogue is the first and maybe only Assassin's Creed game where you play on the other side. You see first hand how their methods of achieving peace and order are similar and different to the Assassins. The gameplay is very similar to Black Flag, with the ship almost being the Co-Star of the game as it was previously, except you have allies in the waters alongside for once. You are helping the British fight the French in the Seven Years War, and this makes for very interesting storytelling all the same. Luckily the story is mainly set on land, for those who loathe endless upon endless of sea missions, and do not feel as boring and repetitive as the previous installments. The story is shorter than I hoped for, but if it was 100 hours long and had over 30 sequences, I would've still called it short, as in my opinion I greatly enjoyed the life of Shay, but collectibles are plentiful, and side missions are far from scarce. If you are a fan like I am of AC, do not feel the way I did, that this game could be looked over, that this was just another cash in for what Black Flag was. It is what Black Flag should have been, only with a Templar at the helm. There are new weapons, new mechanics, and new types of enemies, one's that even attempt to assassinate you. This is not a DLC, this should be considered like Brotherhood or Revelations, where one connects to the other, as this game connects Assassin's Creed 3 by the beginning, to Assassin's Creed Unity by the end.

(But your on PC, so it still looks damn amazing. NOW WITH GODRAYS)\nRogue is easily the best game in the series in terms of story and character. Shay is a very vocal character, he expresses his emotions and how he feels about his actions. He shows his anger, hatred, sadness and joy even more so then any other character. The story is top notch and easily is the darkest game in the series, showing betrayal and revenge in a amazing way.\nGameplay wise it's made small improvements over Black Flag, ship handling and combat is the best it'll ever be in the series. Exploration is enjoyable and offers many scenic routes and views to beautiful locations. Combat hasn't changed much from AC4, with the exception of several new weapons and gadgets at your disposal.\nI hold Rogue to be the crown jewel of the series, obviously it was completely shadowed by Unity but most who own this game will say it has the best story in the series and feels like a return to form like AC Brotherhood or AC2. The story is sadly shorter then the other entries but there is still several large areas and collectibles to grab to keep you busy for long after the story is finished.\nI strongly believe this game was made with alot of love from the team that made this game, because it just feels solid, fun and enjoyable. If this was given more time to make a longer story, and running on the current engine with Unity and Syndicate. This game would easily top the rest in every aspect.\nMy rating: 9.5/10", "hours": 53.4, "username": "Heebrial Niijima", "products": 234, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Is Black Flag an amazing game?  Yes.  Is this game better, gameplay-wise, yes.  Black Flag got us started on this particular AC gameplay, Rogue perfected it.  I played Black Flag twice as long, but mostly because all the cool things in Rogue came from Black Flag first and so I knew them all thoroughly.\nA big con is still the crafting system.  Every island that claims it has a certain type of animals never seems to spawn them.  And crafting ammunition is tedious and one-dart-by-one-dart.  What a waste.\nA big pro is naval battles seem better than ever.  Even with a brig, a step down from Edward Kenway's Frigate, being super tricked out has never felt so advantagious.  Amazing pitched battles and enemies boarding your ship will really put you in the moment.\nStory ended quicker than I liked but mostly because I didn't do all the side quests.

If you enjoyed the pirate loop gameplay of Black Flag this is more of it, but this time instead of the sweltering tropics you're in the snowy North Atlantic coast, the Hudson River Valley, and New York City. The maps are chock full of the usual trademark Ubisoft open world busywork (arguably to pad the short story) but this time around you get to see the other side of things by playing a Templar. Graphically it looks about as good as it can on the aged engine before the one Unity uses came out, but it runs very, very smoothly.\nSome interesting changes include being boarded by the enemy and ramming is sort of an 'ability' now. Instead of just sailing toward a ship you can 'use' the ram and your ship will charge at great speed, sort of like El Impoluto did to to you in Black Flag. The burning oil is also nice and more fun to use than Black Flag's explosive barrels. Shanties of course return but sometimes the game just loves to throw wind gusts at you so many times which cancels the singing, a minor annoyance. Instead of Black Flag's blowpipe you get an air rifle of sorts that provides the same function of darts as well as a grenade launcher with things like exploding gas grenades that can berserk a crowd of guards, or just use shrapnel grenades. In the end, much like Black Flag, the games leaves you wishing Ubisoft would have just committed to making the premise of these two games into their own series sans the Assassin's Creed plot and universe.\nAs we all know with Ubisoft games comes Uplay, so as usual before installing this game, make sure you download Uplay from the Uplay site first and foremost and get it completely updated, make an account, an optionally link it to Steam if you haven't already. Then just leave it open and install the game as your normally would and it should do everything for you.

The story is really great, it gives you a lot of the missing information between Edward and Connor's time, and it gives you the background for Unity.\nFighting is still press-counter-and-win tactics and the ship part of the game is better than Black Flag. The Morrigan comes with Puckle guns instead of Swivel cannons, which basically means that you get a swivel cannon that does less damage but fires a lot more rounds (max non-elite is 25), you get an ice ram that functions like the ram in black flag, except that you get a speed booster for extra damage, and instead of fire barrels, you get burning oil which seems to be more effective because you can cover the path behind you better.\nThe map feels larger than Black Flag, but probably isn't. Since you're in North America, you traqvel more in large rivers than out in the ocean. This makes sailing to your destination a little bit better, except that you'll have to navigate these channels, which means a bunch of turning. In contrast, the land parts of the map are more frequent, which means more land exploring rather than constant ship battles.\nRennovations are back, but only one or two buildings here or there (so it's not like AC II, Brotherhood, or Revelations where you're basically restoring the entire city). There is a banking system, where if you rennovate you get X amount of money every 20 minutes of gameplay\nThere are gang strongholds, which are like Borgia Towers, Templar towers, Forts, etc... Where you take down the leader and do a couple misc side objectives and \"take back\" that region.\nNew weapons/items: Air Rifle (blowgun 2.0) that comes with firecrackers for distraction, An underbarrel grenade launcher for Sleep, Beserk, and Shrapnel grenades and The Sword/Dagger combo which is basically the double swords from Black Flag with some different kill animations. Shay also gets a cloth to cover his face from smoke bombs so he doesn't get stunned if you activate it.\nThere is a unique thing that this game added: stalkers. Stalkers are like bot versions of the black flag multiplayer, where you travel through an area and hear whispers get louder and louder as you get closer to them. You can tun on eagle vision to get a compass of their general area and detect them if you search their hiding spots. They do massive damage if they land an attack on you, but you can counter them if you're quick. Also, they only appear in interesting areas, such as forts, missions, near collectables, etc... It's not like the entire city is filled with them. It's a nice balance.\nCONCLUSION:\nVery, very, good game if you liked Black Flag. This game is basically the lovechild of AC III and AC IV. Colonial area, with great ship battles.The only downside to it is that sometimes it feels less open for ship battles, which makes it hard to manuver.

The show starts off as expected, with your character in the Assassin brotherhood and, predictably, disillusioned and turning to the Templars. From there on start a, regrettably short, campaign of an interesting story, that manages to portray the Templar Order from inside with a neutrality that was missing in the series. You do get to see the \u201cother side\u201d and you do get to see their point of view.\nThe Templar Order is stripped of its demonic cloak and is seen as a collection of individuals, many quite honourable and interesting (hail to thee Haytham Kenway) which simply have a different point of view to the world than the brotherhood.\nHaving played the game after Unity, I did immediately get the feeling of a step back in a technological level \u2013 the engine is lagging far behind that of Unity. The key aspects of what you saw in Black Flag are there, so everything is familiar (even the setting \u2013 a reminder of AC III). This is both good and bad, as you get that familiar tingling you got in Black Flag, however, the North Atlantic is not the Caribbean, so some of that magic is missing and additionally, you have seen it all before \u2013 so there is a weariness factor included.\nSadly, there is a mismatch between the shortness of the main storyline and the overabundance of extra content, making the game seem almost like an item collection game. This is not enough to ruin the game though, and if for nothing else, just to see the other side of the story for once, Rogue is worth your cheese.", "hours": 87.5, "user_id": "76561198057575998", "username": "Pandelis", "products": 37, "early_access": false}

However the reason why I'm not recommending it, is because the story and characters are so underwhemling I can't take the game seriously.  The idea behind this game is amazing.  An assassin turning to the templars and killing them.  It's something we saw and experienced in Assassin's Creed 3.  However we see the turn for him is...easy.  he turns into a templar quickly and without serious thought to reprocussions.  He was raised to hate templars and we see our main character turning to them instantly?  It feels like I was robbed of a fluid storyline.  I pushed this off to continue playing anyway.  The gameplay was fun and I couldn't wait to see how far they would go.  Turns out not far at all.  The game is about six hours long and ends without any real personal change on my part.  Usually with assassin's creed games I feel like I've grown with the character.  At the end of this one I feel the lingering thought of \"That's it?\" and so is my experience with the game.  The main character doesn't have all that much substance, I don't see enough of the templars and their plots.  And the assassins seem like cookie cutter villains that pretend to be heros but it still doesn't work.  You can't just make the good guys the bad guys in such a rushed way like they did here.\nI'd say don't get it.  Go for another assassin's creed game.

The main story could also have used some beefing up; at only 6 sequences it's rather skimpy, fortunately there's plenty of exploring to do (and you'll spend a great deal of time collecting resources to upgrade your sloop).\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game, and I'd hope to see a full-fledged Templar AC game in the future.", "hours": 24.8, "username": "YubYubCommander", "products": 239, "early_access": false}

The wide sprawling naval and land areas are absolutely full of not only boring collectibles, but interesting activities, that stay interesting far longer than you'd expect.\nThey obviously took the oppurtunity of developing a second-rate AAA sequel alongside AC Unity to experiment with the mechanics and formula that has defined AC for a long time, the reversal of roles as a Templar opposed to Assassins means being stalked by Assassins, having to prevent them carrying out Assassinations (a reverse of mission types such as in Revelations) and helping the British fight the French (the Ten Years war is the backdrop to the story as it is technically a prequel to AC3).\nSlight changes in the way you do normal mundane Ubisoft open world collection chores means it's a less tedious for a while, and the additions to sailing, mainly the ice breaker ram and the ability of enemy ships to ram and board you makes the naval part of the game feel very different whilst the regular gameplay loop of firing cannons repositioning and firing remains exactly the same.\nIt's my opinion that the executive figures of Ubisoft will always demand the focus of their developers be on the graphical aspect of their games above all else (focus groups aside, graphical fidelity is visual and extremely easy to sell as a major plus in an otherwise mediocre program), but AC Rogue is a window into what would happen if the developers of these games were given some freedom.

It is not bad game though, it is bad AC:BF wanna-be-clone.\nMy first (bad) experience was the with music, which is clearly worse than one in AC:BF. Worse in the way it lacks \"epicness\" element. And this made most of my sea battles really, really dull. After few hours of game i simply skipped random battles or used fast travel to avoid them completely while in AC:BF i did all i could to start another random battle.\nNow dunno if this is a bug or delibrate intention but while playing on mainland, through majority of gameplay, i had no music at all! Nothing is more annoying than a half-silent game.\nAfter halfway trought game, i found that i'm not really buying the main plot and main character. Maybe because i expected ruthless vendetta story (like in \"The Last Outlaw\" movie with Mickey Rourke) or maybe i was not able to find it interesting and credible. It is another personal thing but there is lots of missed opportunities like focusing bit more on Col. Munro and defence of Fort William Henry (or even meeting Hawkeye when he's rescuing Monro's daughters).\nNext - the upgrade elemtent of game. IMHO slow and hard progression is more satysfying and challenging. It's fun and realistic when you need to pick your battles from the beggining of your adventure. And that moment when you can finally release teh kraken\" with fully upgraded hardware.\nHere? Hell no. After few minutes of gameplay i managed to board and loot frigate and seconds after same happened to TWO man-o-war ships. That alone gave me enough upgrade materials to become harbringer of doom and bring death to everything (including one legendary!)\nTo easy and to early to my personal taste....\nThese are key points that ruined this game for ME, i bought game on sale and it good value for money.  AC:BF is still no.1 in series for me.\nEDIT: shortly after writing this review i finished AC:R with score around 75% and 23 hours on the clock. Minus idle time i estimate time to complete this game ~15 to 20 hours. In AC:BF, if i remember correctly finishing with score around 95% took me 72 hours of good fun.

A lot of people said it's AC4 1.5 or a DLC for AC4. That isn't the case. Rogue is connected in the story with AC3,AC4 and Unity(just a little bit).\nStory\nWell this AC game had one of the best characters i've ever played in a video game. From AC series Shay for me was a master piece. I loved everything about him. He started as a begginer in the assassins just to learn from them, do their jobs and then just to turn on them because they were blind and weren't seeing the danger. Playing as a Templar for the first time was more exciting than i thought. Shay's story is how i said one of the best, after Edward's from AC4.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is kinda the same as AC4, that's why most of the people said it's a copy of AC4. Yeah it has kinda the same mechanics as any AC game and also the naval combat is back from AC4. Also the side activities from AC4 are back too like Assassins contract but here they are Interception contracts where you have to stop an assassin from killing someone, naval forts combat for more activities, hunting, legendary ship battles etc. The economy is also the same, you need cargo to upgrade your ship, the Morigan and also to renovate the 3 big regions, New York, River Vally and North Atlantic. The naval combat is the same as AC4, the only thing changed is that now that your ship can be boarded and you need to defend it. The on foot combat is also the same with minor new animations. Now we also have economical zones to capture, these are the naval forts and the fortresses from the citys/villages, these unlocking new side activities. Also the Naval Fleet is back too. However the minor bugs when the game doesn't know where you want to go or the ragdoll efect sometimes make the game glitchy, but it is not that often.\nSound\nThe sound effects, the voices, i just love everything about them. The singing while sailing on the sea is back so hunt those shanties.\nGraphics\nAC Rogue uses the same engine as AC4 did with maybe some minor upgrades. If you liked AC4, you will think this will look awesome too.\nMultiplayer\nNope, finally.\nAll in all, Rogue is a briliant game. Yes, it was in the shadow of Unity when it first came out, but it is 10 times better than Unity from all the point of views expect the graphics. Ubisoft Sofia did an amazing job here, Ubisoft Montreal should take a look at this and take notes or atleast look back at AC4. I recommend Rogue to any AC fan.

Shay Patric Cormack, the protagonist, is a fantastic, deep, well-written character that I found that I could really empathize with.  Unlike previous titles, you see this story from the opposite side, the side of the Templars as opposed to that of the Assassin Brotherhood.  The characters around you, on both sides, are realistic and enjoyable and you'll also cross paths with several series fan favorites during the course of the story.

The gameplay is solid AC but rather than evolve from Black Flag, Ubi just stuck in a bunch more dreck.  There are so many collectibles that serve so little purpose that there is hardly any point to trying.  Shay is also loaded down with so much kit that there is no point in calling this a stealth game anymore.  You can literally assault forts head on, singelhandedly, and not even empty your pouches of bullets, throwing knife (why the hell does he even carry one), smoke bombs, rope darts, berserk and sleep darts from your rapid fire rifle, berserk and sleep and shrapnel bombs from your upgraded rifle....it's ludicrous that Shay can even swim with this much gear, he should sink.\nSome of the new touches are nice; the stalker mechanic is fun, the crafting is now easier and you can buy your way through instead of grinding for white whales; best of all, you can skip to the end of those interminable naval battles.  But this really doesn't make up for the worst storytelling I have seen in a while.\nSPOILERS FOLLOW\nI can handwave a lot for a good story, or I would be angry every time I got out of the water and immediately fired a flintlock black powder pistol.  Stupid guards are to be expected, and though I hate how polite bad guys are as they wait for me to kill them one at a time, I still enjoy laying waste to them.  But despite having pre-formulated elaborate, suicidal plans to \"delay\" Shay, when he is laying helpless at a Master Assassin's feet she goes for a slow kill by taking his gas mask.  After he survives that, shes poisons him and runs.  So she didn't want to kill her former student personally, fine, but then why didn't she just throw away the antidote she was carrying?  Bad writing.  I have read high school student work that shows more appreciation for character development with more ability to carry it out.  Shay saying he feels really bad about betraying and killing everybody that he ever cared about in his earlier life rings more than hollow.  He is the bad guy and an a**hole to boot.  I kept waiting for that redeeming moment for him, and it never came.  I think I would have had more fun if I could have found some way for him to die of poetic justice instead of jackbooting his way over the bodies of his friends.  He isn't even an antihero, he is just a whiny punk and I feel punked for playing this game through to the end.", "hours": 37.0, "user_id": "76561197971582031", "username": "BitingSarcasm", "products": 110, "early_access": false}

Rogue is quite different however. This is the first game you play as a Templar, and actually experience the villan's point of view first hand. It takes place between the events of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed 3, and is very similar to Black Flag.\nPros:\n-Beautiful scenery\n-Different storyline perspective\n-More variety with player skins\n-More variety with terrain and the places you explore\n-Improvement on naval combat\n-Give more detail into Haytham Kenway's story before AC 3\nCons:\n-The weaponry functions almost exactly the same as in Black Flag, except they have different names and appearances (although there are a few new things)\n-Lots of minor glitches (invincible enemies, phasing through the landscape, being hit/detected through walls) which don't cause much issues with playing, but definitely break immersion\n-Although showing the story from a Templar perspective, the main concept is the same: Find and kill a list of targets throughout the game, getting closer and closer to eliminating the main target at the end\nAll in all, Assassin's Creed: Rogue is worth the money, and if you liked Black Flag, you will definitely enjoy this game. However, if you are expecting this game to be new and groundbreaking in the Assassin's Creed saga, then you will be disappointed.\nEDIT: I have started seeing a LOT of glitches when it somes to on-foot combat. If I board 20 ships, about 18 or 19 will have some kind of serious bug, like being hit by enemies that are stuck in walls and can't be killed, or using my last berserker grenade on a cluster of enemies, just to have them stand there doing nothing.

When you play as a Templar and you are being hunted by an Assassins, you must be careful not to be assassinated. You also has to take down the Assassin (or Gang) HQ. The killing of the Assassin (or Gang) is not simple killing, you have to use the sense in eagle vision mode, because the leader is hiding just like you when you play in other Assassin's Creed game. The gang leader also can assassinate you too (so you must aware with counter).\nNew Weapon. Air Rifle, it can shoot darts (Berserk, sleep, and firework dart) and launching a grenade (Berserk, sleep, and shrapnel grenade).\nThe Fighting style is same as Assassin's Creed IV but you are using Sword and knife (for main weapon beside dual hidden blades), but it has new combo when two people trying to hit you and you counter it.\nDifferent kind of ship. Different weapon between ACIV and ACR, when ACIV has swivel gun, ACR has puckle gun (it is more fun IMO). When ACIV has chain cannon, ACR has Carronade cannon. Fire Barrels replaced with oil barrel (so you can burn the sea)\nThe Story is great, this game can make you open your minds about the Assassins and the Templars. It also connected with AC III, AC IV, and AC Unity. (some says it connected to watch dogs too but i didn't play the game so i cannot confirm it).\nThe Graphic are better than ACIV in my opinion. It also can pass 60 FPS with same PC specification.\nBut it has some bugs, when 5 bounty hunter try to chase me they got stuck in a pit in mine shaft. I gaves me advantage to put them into berserk using berserk grenade.\nAnother bug is when i am doing some Assassin interferention mission, i try to assassinate the assassin while that assassin was crouching on the graveyard, suddenly my character elevated very high, then i fall and synchronized.\nLast, this game is better than ACU\nI give it 8/10 because of bugs :D", "hours": 46.5, "username": "Diario", "products": 73, "early_access": false}

Now it being short isnt actually a bad thing because its short and sweet plain and simple. But the reason it was difficult to make is because they made it after Edward Kenway But before Conner Kenway and doing that is hard because conner is only edwards grandson making the time between that kind of hard to make but still pulled through.\nAllright you play as Shay Cormac an assassin who discovers he doesnt belong in the assassins (reason i will not give because its a spoiler) and long story short starts working for the templars. Now shay is equipped with his standard hidden blades, a cutlas and a smaller sword, two pistols, rope darts, and his very special rifle now in the trailer its an actual gun but in game its a dart gun bassically kind of dumb but it gets good range so kind of creative, and last but not least Shays vessle \"The Morrigan\" not quite a frigate but not a brig either. Its just a bit smaller than the jackdaw and honestly not the best name either i mean Jackdaw sounds rigid sounds like a good name for a ship but Morrigan (MORE-I-GAN) gross.\nin conclusion though the story being short is kind of a negative but its the only one that i have\n_Preformance_\nOkay this game runs like a dream you dont actually need a high tech pc to run this i have an intel i3 dual core with 2.8 GHz and 4gb of ram and i was running this on ultra at 55-53 frames a second not bad at all. Speaking of graphics the game looks beutiful, it looks amazing.\n_Conclusion_\nWith this game being just a little too short brings this game down But they really didnt have a lot of space since this game was both a sequel and a prequel. And even being short this game is amazing its like a breath of fresh air so many side things that you can do too. The only other negative is the price its a bit too much.

Rogue is the first AC game to finally offer a(n in universe) Templar perspective, giving the player a different viewpoint into the the realm of AC and an opportunity to consider the motivations of a group that is typically portrayed as a mob of clandestine sycophants hellbent on ruining the lives of the poor schumcks outside their clique. Although some of the plot and dialogue are a little wearisome (I find this to be the case with ninety percent of video games ), the main story arc is engaging and brings a fresh take to the typical AC narrative. First impressions of the game were solid as well: just about anything beats playing through the first twenty minutes to half-hour of a game as a prepubescent goofing around in bushes or stealling things... While the gameplay is virtually identical to Black Flag, I didn't mind too much; having to learn new keybindings for every bloody game (pun intended) they release gets a little wearisome. Additionally, since it's set in North America, the boreal landscape is a pleasant deviation from Black Flag's lush West Indies, while still retaining a good sense of adventure. Most of the gear is the same, with a few minor exceptions, and I personally feel the available outfits and the ship design are infinitely preferable to BF. I recommend it most to diehard fans of the series, but I believe most people would be able to get something out of Rogue, provided they aren't bored by playing a game overly similar to its predecessors.", "hours": 484.0, "username": "Seeker", "products": 119, "early_access": false}

For example, since you play a Templar, you have sidequests to protect assassination targets instead of killing them. You get a silenced rifle for the sleep/berserk darts, with an extra dart type to detonate explosive barrels or attract attention to where it was shot. You also get a grenade launcher that has explosive/sleep/berserk grenades. All of this is fun to use to fool around with the enemies, who mostly aren't a challenge (unless you're always trying to not get spotted).\nPiracy, whaling, hunting and crafting are back, diving is gone, those super ships are in again, there's a lot more areas to explore and convoys to raid, ship weapons are mostly the same, there's more types of collectibles, and the British soldiers are your friends this time (sort of).\nLike AC4, it's not a game that's very concerned with stealth. There's the occasional (side) objective to not get spotted, but you can generally kill a whole street worth of dudes to escape.\nOne annoying addition to the game: hidden assassins. You'll hear whispers growing louder as you approach an assassin who's hidden in the bushes, on the roof, or in a crowd. If you come too close, they'll dart out and stab you, then run away again. There's a LOT of these dudes, but fortunately if you kill them, they stay gone.\nStory-wise, it takes place between AC4 and AC3, and uses characters from both. I assume it would be pretty hard to follow if you hadn't played both AC3 and 4 before. There's a visit to another AC game later on, but it's more of a cameo. It's an absolutely non-essential story if that's all you're here for, but then they've all kind of felt like that since Ezio's trilogy ended. The way the main character defects from the Assassins and how steadfast he is in remaining with the Templars are kind of wonky, as is the main character's Irish accent. Thematically it's a new spin on things, with you hunting down your old associates, but not enough time was spent with them beforehand to really have that make an impact.\nThe meta-story takes place in the same setting AC4 did; Abstergo Entertainment - a Templar front company. I don't think you're the same character from AC4, but it's not that clear. While AC4's meta-story had hints of what happened to the First Civilization, this one doesn't. It's honestly not essential either, but the documents you find do flesh out the backstory somewhat.\nSo if you want more AC4, here you go. If you want the next evolution in Assassin's Creed mechanics, or a story that feels like more than a stopgap, look into Assassin's Creed Unity (pretty underrated from what I've played so far).", "hours": 21.8, "username": "iwem.xo", "products": 1500, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

But I can't agree to that. His judgement is emotional. His inner doubts aren't revealed sufficiently. And the whole transition from an assassin to a templar feels rather rushed. I'd say Shay has the personality of a teenager and his worldview is rather naive. His willingness to do good and sense of fairness are admirable, but it's about the only side of him that is portrayed. I can accept such a flat personality in a video game, but real people are more complicated.\nNevertheless, playing as a templar was a fresh breeze to the series. Especially, because having played all the previous titles, I've started to doubt the whole Assassin's cause. Only few people have the capacity to use their freedom wisely. Most people need guidance and control and the Templars offer just like that.

I even took the Legenday ships down with no problem at all. Well, perhaps, this is partially explained by the fact that Morrigan is a sloop-of-war, but Jackdaw was a brig.

However, the MP's stalking and killing part was transfered to the SP and you fight AI stalkers instead of other players. I think they really overdid this, because even after taking down all the gang HQs and hostile settlements, there were stalkers everywhere. It's distracting and just too much. You can't get rid of them permanently.\nIf you buy all the DLCs, there's really a lot of weapons, outfits and collectibles you can obtain. They all are nice and cool. But I feel that the game was artificially made longer through these optional collectible and economical missions, hiding the fact that the main story is quite short. There are only six short sequences and few short present day tasks between them. I'd say, if you ignore the collectibles, forts and outposts, you can finish the game in about 10 hours or even less.\nAlso, with each new game released after\nit starts to feel more and more that\njust sticks to a certain recipe.

It's a reskinned version of the great pirate-themed Assassins Creed that came out the year before, but with a few nice refinements. The story is very short and basic, and not that interesting. I never really warmed to the main character that shifts from Assassin to Templar after being betrayed by them. His motivations to change sides seemed pretty shallow, and strangely the Assassins that you deal with in the game act like\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and the Templars act like bros, so it just felt like in this instance, it felt right to swap sides. If this character had been working with another Assassin brotherhood, this would not have happened.\nThe gameplay is pretty solid though, you can run around an outpost swapping between stealth and combat pretty easily, and the naval combat is as fun as ever. You just don't feel invested in wanting to unlock everything or see every location like you do in Black Flag.\nIf you are an Assassin's Creed fan, and you can get this cheap, it's worth a run through. It's just not that interesting as a whole. It does however come with a nice revelation at the end that links it into the next game in the series (chronologically) which is Assassin's Creed Unity.\nPros\n- Solid gameplay mechanics, refining all the skills and features introduced in the previous games\n- Probably one of the easiest to use, and most lethal characters to play as in the franchise\n- The game looks and runs great\n- Nice ending that links up with Assassin's Creed Unity\nCons\n- Short and simple story that isn't that interesting in comparison to the other entries in the series\n- You don't end up caring about any of the characters except for the few that were present in other entries in the series\n- Doesn't really reveal anything new about the Templars that we didn't know before\n- No Templar specific skills or weapons.

The main protaganist, Shay, develops and chaneges a lot throught the story, questioning his path the entire way.\n3:Good ship combat, taken straight from AC:4 Black flag, this combat feels a lot deadlier in these northern climates, as ice bergs and the new addition of burning oil spices up naval combat.\n4:Good modern story, you are still a random \"researcher\" for Abstergo, but you actually have an impact this time, helping the templars dimoralize the assasins with Shay's story.\n5:Ties into AC 3, 4, and Unity. This game is the ultimate branch between these games, with a young Achillies from AC 3, and old Adewale from AC 4, and a special apperance from Arno's father, who is in Unity.\n6:Great graphics, Ubisoft really pulled off the rugged north of Vinland and the Gulf of St.Lawrence\n7:Playes very well into the actual historical events of the 7 years war (or the French and Indian war here in Merica), you see many prominant figures, including James Cook, George Washington and more.\nCons:\n1:New York from AC 3 is ported straight over, and shows the lack of dev time avalible due to Unity.\n2:Short, if I had not 100% the game, I could have done the main story in about 6 hours.\n3:Characters needed more time, Characters you meet who end up dying, you are supposed to feel somthing, but you met most of them for five minutes at the beggining of the game, and then again at the end.\n4:The switch to Templar is way to fast, Shay goes from a Assassin to Templar in the first act of the game, so about 1 hour. I think he should have been with the creed a bit more to show why he left and to develop the other assasins.\n5:Collectibles, it wouldn't be an Ubisoft game without hundreds of random collectibles all over the map for some stupid outfit you will never wear.\n6:The hacking mini game in the real world, very tedious and boringly easy, or very hard.\nOverall:\nA good game that could have been better, if given more dev time. If Ubisoft hadn't put out two AC games in one year and just focused on Rogue then Unity, most of my cons would have been addressed.

Finally you don't see the world presented as totally black and white - with the first being the assassins and the other - templars.

Rogue showed me that even some of the asasins creed's morals are to be questioned. anyway i absolutely loved this game even with its few flaws, some including, very short main campaign length, shays voice is absolutely annoying, and not enough side objectives. that being said the story was great, the game is a filler between ac3 and ac4 aswell as a prologue to ac unity. the unique weapons u got were very fun and were kinda op at times haha. hunting asasins never felt so good even though they are tought( ie they can stealth in brush, more alert than regular ai, use smoke and pistols too well). the game is also the most optimized video game on pc to date, becasue it was intended for old consoles unlike unity which were made for the new console generation. everything was perfect though if you count out shays annoying as voice, short story however it left me confused as to which side i rather like now, assasins or templars. imagine this, would u want donald trump(templars) running the country or having a purge anarchy libertarianism type government where everyone is free to do their own will(think about it carefully)....i recommend the game but dont expect to be playing it for too long", "hours": 10.9, "username": "JeffBezosMinion", "products": 109, "early_access": false}

Rogue felt like an extension of ACIV, and it maintained my interest in the mechanics of the previous game.\nStory:\nOur story begins with Shay, an assassin who is a pupil of Aquilles, the assassin who teaches us in ACIII. An action by the assassins severs Shay's trust in them and begins his descent toward the Templar side. On our way we begin to understand more about the Templars and really see the other side of the coin. The present day storyline is still present, and we still play as the same Abstergo employee from ACIV. This time we're given even more backstory and introduced to a few new characters that bring us closer to understanding the Templars.\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is just like ACIV, with a few new gimmicks and weapons for our character and ship. The part I enjoyed most was the range that the Air Rifle introduced. Taking down an entire compound with it was very easy and fun to do, though it did make fights too easy and took away the challenge of having to hide in haystacks and around corners like in ACII. Also from ACIV we don't have 4 pistols anymore, only 2. We maintain our 2 swords and many other weapons like the rope darts, berserk/sleep darts. and of course our hidden blades. A few new additions are added into the game, such as an enemy type that strikes quickly and quietly like an assassin would, but the game makes it easy to find and kill these enemies if you pay attention. Also there are gang compounds which you can clear out and take over in order to access your fleet and bank. The ship combat is pretty similar to ACIV with some new ship additions and we still have \"Legendary Battles.\"\nBugs/glitches/What I hated\nAMD GPU users are at a loss with this game, something caused the game to crash as soon as the story was launched if the environment setting was set beyond normal even if your GPU is more than capable of running the game. This title still suffers from the age old AC problem in which your character will sometimes not respond to commands and plummet to his death instead of jumping to a nearby ledge. One of my favorite glitches was with an assassin we had to kill falling into the ocean and his marker sinking and sinking until I had to restart the mission. Some of the things I hated include the large amounts of animus fragments and the fact that gang HQs really gave no advantage and were just another way for you to see your fleet and visit the bank. There really weren't many new outfits, cool guns, or swords either.\nFinal verdict:\nGet this game if you enjoyed ACIV and would like more of that great ship combat, this is a very solid title and defenitely should be picked up on sale. It adds just enough to feel like it's own story but is pretty plain when compared to ACII or ACIV.

I immensely enjoyed that game for the most part. When I sat down to play this game, it felt familliar. Almost too familliar.\nAt times, Assassin's Creed Rouge can feel like a bit of a rehash of AC4 in terms of it's mechanics. It just feels simillar. However, that doesn't take away the quality of the game itself. All of the things that it's utilizing from AC4 are good. The story is very interesting, and different. The main character Shay is an Assassin who betrays the creed turns to the Templars. The reason why he did this was very understandable if that makes sense. Now, the Abstergo Entertainment office work is, well, it's there. Nothing too interesting, and on par with AC4's Abstergo segments. The ship mechanics are pretty much exactly the same as AC4, along with the combat and assassinations. If I had but one flaw with the game, it would be that the story felt a couple hours short. It felt like I beat the game fairly quickly, even while taking my time and getting stuck on missons.\nOverall, Assassin's Creed Rouge is a great entry into the AC franchise.

Master Franklin, Master Cormac\nWhen first see a templar call Franklin as Master Franklin, \"What? Franklin is a templar? Then why Haythem did not know him or vice versa?\". And when Munro call Shay as Master Cormac, I am speechless. It seems templars calling anyone respectable as master in this sequel while this did not appear in previous sequel, not mentioning how weird would the person not templars feel while being called Master.\n2. Killing civilians\nGenerally, assassins don't kill innocents, so do some templars like Haythem and Shay. Throught out the series desynchronisation would be engaged if you killed 2-3 civilians. However in this sequel, despite the warning \"This ancestor don't kill civilians or domestic animals\", nothing happened.\nGameplay\nWhen I reach sequence 3, I am so happy the renovation system is back! Generally the gameplay seems like a well mixture of revelation, blackflag and unity, except too much collectibles. The freerunning puzzles for pillar and templar map are good, while the other seems like the same of just dfferent set.\nAnd bugs, yeah, annoying bugs, so do glitches:\n1. Why the hell would I fall while climbing the second level on a tree? This tree is just the same with others!\nAlso appear in little building. Well inherited from AC: Unity lol.\n2. How fascinating the camera is buried into objects, in the scene after upgrading ship or Eagle Sensed Templar Cross!\n3. Graphic glitches too often, hover over ground, fingers nailed into wood or stone during climbing or grabing somthing. It looks like Ubisoft applied Blackflag's motion data while it is not calibrated with new character model.\n4. Another bug inherited from previous sequel. Unexpected interruption of motions/skills\nSome motion or skills would be disrupted by high profile movement like climbing and falling. Players will understand that, of course you can't change bullet while climbing. What players not expected is, running or walking down a mild slope will often produce slight jumping or cripples, thus interrupted changing bullets, etc. Similar happens in AC:Unity also while the disguise is ended because you walk down the one step in front of a shop.", "hours": 48.8, "username": "Xerubium", "products": 242, "early_access": false}

Runs much smoother than Black Flag on similar hardware as some Nvidia specific features such as PhysX are not present on this title. In the modern era, the game's graphics will be well handled by a mid-range rig, and a solid 60FPS gameplay experience is possible without any glitches.\nStory:\nThis game takes us on to the side of the templars, featuring legends such as Haytham Kenway, Shay Patrick Cormac, the great assassins Adewale, and a lot of other memorable characters. I would strongly advice any new player to grab copies of Assassins Creed III and Black Flag before diving into this game, and prerably play Assassins Creed Unity to get a feel of the whole story.\nCharacter development, the game's length and the gameplay intertwine to create a stoey that tells of a man turned by guilt against his brethren to join the Templars, and in so doing becomes driven by purpose and principle, above all else. We see Shay Cormack transform into a lethal Assassin slayer, having to counter visages from his past life using the very skills they taught him. And your part in playing his memories through the Animus is to learn to couner attacks from assassins and to raid their camps. No small feat, and you will be absorbed over tens of hours exploring the open world here.\nAudio/ Sound work: Excellently done. The music in this game is expertly composed, and the shanties are a timely and welcome addition to the deep, well-crafted in-game environment. Also, quite memorable.\nThe english speakers are quite fluent, and all in all, a high quality recreation of the characters they represent.\nGameplay: Reminiscent of Assassins Creed: Black Flag, the action is split about 65:35 land/sea in missions, and there's a ton of side activities, exploration, assassinations, and naval expeditions to execute in this exhilirating chapter of Assassins Creed. A slight drawback (in my opinion) is that combat , naval expeditions and assassinations feel a bit repetitive (a common ailment of the franchise) and not much innovation has been done to the aging combat system in this franchise. The new story arc does introduce new gameplay elements such as reverse boarding and an easier transition to legendary naval battles, and these are welcome improvements over Black Flag's offerings.\nOnline/ Multiplayer:\nSelf-descriptive. Prepare to spend much of it on land, though. Take hints from the DLCs in that regard. Your mileage may vary, knowing how unreliable Uplay's network connectivity can be.\nI'm aware console gamers may have a better experience here compared to the PC version.\nRecommendations: Buy this game in a steam sale, and do not purchase it as part of a Ubisoft bundle as it will cost you more.

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 101, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-03-28", "text": "Assassin's Creed: Rogue, released in 2014, is a game published by Ubisoft and developed by Ubisoft Sofia. Rogue is a fictional and historical third person action-adventure game set a year after Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Rogue is set in the French and Indian War of 1754-1763 that consists of the French Army, Native American Army, and British Army. The two main factions in the game are the Templar Order and the Assassin Brotherhood. The game is seen through the perspective of the Templar Order and played through Shay. You, the player, play as Shay Patrick Cormac, a tough and confident Assassin and Templar. The game is a very solid game that has a good story, a very strong set of side missions and excellent technical performance.\nRogue has a good story. It takes you through the period in-between Assassin's Creed III through Achilles and Haytham Kenway and Black Flag through Adewale. It's your typical AC story. Whoever you may be you are to find the Pieces of Eden with shocking outcomes based off those artifacts. Shay, who mainly plays alongside Haytham in the later stages of the game, is in a race essentially against the Brotherhood. The missions are fun. The graphics spice up the atmosphere of certain missions while the naval combat enhances the game because there are missions in the ocean, allowing the game to have a nice balance with land and sea missions. I completed the game in 19 hours and 45 minutes so I would assume I completed the main story within 15 hours. I will note players can probably get at least 40 hours of the game. But, I would say the campaign was rushed in certain parts notably the ending. The ending was solid but not better because the story overall was limited. The game concluded stories including the story of Hope and Shay but it could not complete other stories such as Achilles because the game was set before Assassin's Creed III. The final cutscene was interesting but again it did not close the story with Shay particularly, it just left it open to interpretation, which I felt was not the right ending.\nThe side missions were excellent because the side missions actually added to the game. There are a boat-load full of content in the game, which is great too. But, tons of current games feature side missions that are filler to add playability to the game. However in Rogue, the side missions add further to the background of the series and have other stories that cover situations within Abstergo Industries among other missions. For instance, you, the unspecified player working in the Animus in the game, have to fix the cores of the computers with a mini-game and once completed you garner a nice and simple video that discusses things within the company such as events that had occured. The stories for example are nothing extreme though they do add some context to the company's operations or the first civilisation, and so forth. As for my experience, I completed 52% of the game, which is the main story and some other content. I do not find the incentive to play more of the game because the main story is finished, that is the only reason. If the main story was not finished I would have played through most to all of the content in the game.\nThe technical performance is extremely stable and smooth in Rogue. In comparison to ACIII that was released two years prior, this exceeds the performance of that game in every aspect. I achieved a constant 55-60FPS throughout the game whereas in modern times I achieved a stable 30-45FPS. In ACIII I was on a 45-60FPS for the majority of the game and 15-25FPS for modern day. I praise the developers for successfully optimising this game as this was a port from Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.\nThe game featured good new characters in Rogue but also characters that you come to expect from Black Flag and III. Shay is a great character with his mannerisms and his brilliant voice acting. Shay's dialogue is strong because he is very confident in his actions, particularly his saying of 'I make my own luck'. His voice acting meets the different circumstances in the game. For instance, if he was bleeding from the stomach and he had dialogue you could tell the difference as he would struggle to speak. If Shay was angry you could tell in his deeper voice tones. This was something that lacked in ACIII as many characters in that game had a a lack of variety in voice tones. The other new Rogue characters are good. Hope is a standout with her elegant personality and her viciousness in action.\nThe only negatives I encompassed with the game were minor. A notable glitch was the sound. Frequently throughout the game there would be a double sound for animations such as in the sword fighting. Secondly, accessing the naval campaign was annoying because there was no simple entry into it like in previous games with their variations. The naval campaign is contract based, equal event to brotherhood missions in previous games. Again though, nothing major but a slight annoyance. There were other very minor bugs but are not big enough to list them as I noticed them maybe twice.\nOverall, AC: Rogue is a good game. It was not a good game but it was not average. The story in Rogue was good but had an abrupt ending. The side missions in Rogue were awesome and added a lot of context to the background storylines of the series. The technical optimisation is a hit as the game was smooth and stable throughout. The characters were really good adding a vast mix of personalities from previous games and a line of new characters. I would recommend this game. At $32.95 I would recommend a full purchase because it really is a nice game that has not many issues at all. I would not recommend the Digital Deluxe Edition at full price but if on sale I would recommend. 7.5/10\nThanks for reading my review!

There aren't tons of missions on the map that you can do, it's the main quest and then some occasional others... so for people who want a huge environment to flip around in, kill people, do some detective work, etc, I'd rather recommend Unity or Syndicate.  I know I'll definitely be buying Syndicate.\nBUT Rogue redeems itself with the ships!

It's not like Unity where it's a very dragged out story just to make it seem like it was worth your money. I will be honest; when I first bought this game for $59.99 USD, I felt it was a tad bit overpriced. Felt like it should have $49.99 at the most, mainly because it is not as large as Assassin's Creed IV, but I got over it rather quick.\nIn this game you follow the path of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin living in the times shortly before Connor enters the scene, but well after Edward Kenway leaves the scene (and is long dead) while his son Haytham searches the Colonies for the Grand Temple. Shay is sent on a mission (these are spoilers but it happens within the first hour of the game, and is the base plot) to Lisbon, where he is to look at a Selsmic Piece of Eden, which is commonly just called a Seed of Eden or a Tree of Eden. These pieces of eden have the power, when removed from their place, to make whatever location is holding up to instantaneous collapse itself and self-destruct.\nShay journeys on this mission to Lisbon and heads underneath a temple in the Carmo Convent. Shay, unknowing of what the result would be, touches the SPOE, and unintentionally causes the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake/Tsunami Disaster, causing the city to fall on All Saints' Day. Shay, rightfully\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off, heads back to his Assassin HQ to tell his mentor, Achilles Davenport (the mentor of Connor from AC3 who is younger now) what happened. Achilles does not listen and plans to go to the other three temples contain a SPOE.\nAnd so, Shay goes\nfrom the Assassins, wanting to join the Templars and stop them from accidentally destroying more cities. This is the basic plot of the game, and in my opinion, one of the best. The entire story keeps me hooked and it ends perfectly, The game is roughly about 6 sequences, which is perfect. It was a short game but in a good way.\nIf you liked Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, IV, and somewhat III, this is perfect for you and makes up for the disappointing Unity.\nI rate this game a 9/10, and think IGN's review is bologna.

If you enjoyed Blackflag (which if you like Assassins Creed or Pirate Games, you did).\nNow, lets address the issues -\n-It's essentially Blackflag with a different story, not very many new things are introduced.\n-Theres this one chase sequence that is very easy to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up, and end up chasing them around New York forever.\n-The same occasional thing where you're looking just barely the wrong way and Shay spazzes out and won't move.\nThe Good fun Naughty Bits -\n- The story is good, it's a perspective you don't usually see from these games.\n- You get the Rope Dart really early on, it will become your best friend, I honestly didn't know it could do so much when I played Blackflag\n- You get an Ice Ram.

It's a last-gen game, and was released on the same day as Unity, and of course since Ubi spent all their time focusing on Unity, Rogue feels more like a filler game than a full-on setup.  But as someone who cut her AC teeth on such a filler game (Revelations), I feel that Rogue is good enough to stand on its own as a major title.\nSo like I said, great game, very close second-place for best in the series in my opinion (second only to Black Flag), with solid gameplay and a great story that gives a unique look at the \"enemy\" faction, the Templar Order.

In a way, it is the AC: Brotherhood to Black Flag's AC II. It kind of almost has too much to do in it, really, as I just beat it after spending a lot of time doing side activities and I still finished with quite a lot of stuff left over to do and about a 76% completion rating. Hell, half of New York isn't even used in the game but you can still explore it, collect items, and complete side activities there. Speaking of which, this game is pretty huge. There's tons of land to explore across multiple different maps, with smaller story-related locations, too. Much like Black Flag this game is a damn fine pirate simulator, with a lot of ship sailing, plundering, and ship combat. While it doesn't look as nice as Black Flag, for a last-gen game it comes pretty damn close and looks great. The soundtrack is also really well done with some really good voice acting, too.\nYour enjoyment of the story depends on how much of a fan you are of the series as a whole, but this is a direct sequel to Black Flag, so even if you only played that game there is a lot to enjoy about this game and how it relates to the events that unfolded during Black Flag. Even better, if you played AC III it ties very heavily into the story of that game, as well, and leads directly into the events that will unfold in AC: Unity. Plus, if you complete side activities there are a ton of little bits and pieces that talk about the events of prior AC games as well as providing introductions to characters of future AC games such as the trilogy of AC: Chronicles games, Unity and Syndicate. The whole game feels like a love letter to fans of the series, so if you've stuck with it for this long then you'll be handsomely rewarded for your time invested.\nIt plays like an Assassin's Creed game through and through, though, so for some people out there this game still won't do anything to convert them. For others, though, such as fans of the series or even people that only played Black Flag or either avoided Unity or were disappointed by it, this is a really solid game. As an added bonus it is also nicely optimized. I played on an AMD FX-4350 CPU, Radeon R9 270 GPU, along with 16 GB of DDR3 SDRAM with maxed-out settings across the board and I had a solid 60 FPS from start to finish.

I haven't had any serious problems or bugs while playing with it outside of the usual small ones that tend to come with AC games, like getting stuck floating/falling between two people, clipping issues, and ragdolls freaking out.\nThat being said, there just doesn't feel like there's that much new to the game. Did you like Assassin's Creed 4? Well here you go. It's essentially the same game.\nWanna walk through the exact same environments in Abstergo Industries to hack/fix computers and pick up tablets? Well, it's all here. Only instead of hacking into security rooms occasionally, they're still on the map but impossible to enter, with either an error message on the door's console or a guard standing in front of the door, saying \"You can't come in here, orders are orders\" any time you are within 10 feet of him.\nDid you like the naval combat from AC4? Did you like that boring 'trading' minigame? Well, that's all back, with essentially no changes and similiar, if not the same, UI.\nThere was one aspect of the game that I thought was original, and that's the stalkers, which sort of try to recreate the old multiplayer aspects into singleplayer. They're enemy assassins who will hide in bushes and haystacks and rooftops and ambush you as you get close, though you get a warning with weird whispering and screen effects. And then I remembered that those same exact enemies were in Assassin's Creed Revelations, and I completely forgot about them.\nSo, if you liked the gameplay from Assassin's Creed 4, this is basically an expansion pack on that, though a bit more limited. No diving sections, for example.\nSo, what about the story? A lot of other reviewers have praised the story, and I somewhat agree with them. The game doesn't try to cover as many characters and as many years as AC 3 and 4 did, so everything seems to fit a bit better without weird gaps where a character will show up hours later and I can barely remember him.\nHowever, the story is a bit frustrating because the entire plot is based around every character being idiotic and not knowing how to communicate. You know all those romance movies where there's a misunderstanding or miscommunication, and the leads break-up, but by the end they reconcile and learn the truth? It's basically the same in this game, only with less reconciling and more stabbing.\nI did enjoy the game, and I put a lot of hours in it.

I haven't played these but know enough about the gameplay and content to understand that there are quite a few similarities between them that players might not like to see. Some of the content, including the sailing, is very closely related to previous Assassin's Creeds. Despite this though, I would definitely recommend this game.", "hours": 19.3, "user_id": "76561198192382033", "username": "Frostyyy", "products": 45, "early_access": false}

AC: Rogue came out on the PS3 and Xbox 360 the same year Unity came out for the next-gen consoles. Ironically, the previous generation of consoles, and later PC, got the good AC of that year. Rogue is more like an expansion to AC IV: Black Flag, borrowing many elements from previous ACs as well, such as renovations. Anyway, pros, cons, and whatevers:\nPROS:\n+Unlike Unity, the game runs well, the parkour isn't broken, and the game isn't as bug filled.\n+The sailing returns and there are a few additions here and there, such as being boarded by enemy ships.\n+More sea shanties.\n+You get to play as a Templar for once, which means the story is taken in a different direction. When I originally got this game, I thought the reason for Shay's betrayal would be half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and forced since the story in AC has been lacking. However, color me surprised that the reason for Shay's betrayal is well justified. Bravo writers! You aren't all completely stupid... But see below.\n+If you wanted Black Flag 2, this game is for you.\nMIXED:\n+/-The past story seems half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665at times. It's obvious the writers for this game wanted to keep the Assassins as this holy order of Do No Bad, which is very ironic since the enemies are based off a religious order. And, this isn't much of a spoiler but, at the end of the game, for some reason, Shay wants to have another character spared... Yet he kills everyone else. Sure, said character says he's sorry, but you're a bloody assassin! They even make it a point earlier in the game that you kill people who have no threat whatsoever.\n+/-Whatever issues you, the reader, had with Black Flag make an encore. There isn't much else to say except....\nCONS:\n-Damn it, Ubisoft, quit it with the future story!  If you thought the future story for Unity and Syndicate was bad, you have no idea. The stupid officer worker motif comes back again, except you're a different employee and, oh my god, the \"supporting\" black chick (screw whatever her name is) and obviously bad guy boss Scar (not his real name, too, but his design is so cliche is hurts to look at him and is a crime to not call him anything else) are the worse additions to the series. They make a cameo in Syndicate and, thankfully, they don't talk much. In Rogue, however, they talk. The black chick can best be described as a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer character with sandpaper for a personality; everything she says is stupid, unneccesary, and I wish she didn't exist. In fact, I wish the person who came up with her would die in a fire. I seriously hate her guts. As for Scar, he's.. um.. a stereotypically gritty white guy with a scar. I could tell he was evil the moment I saw him. I don't have much to say about Scar because... He doesn't say any horrible dialog and looks like an evil stereotype. What has been said about other characters can just be CTRL+c and CTRL+v'd for him.\n-(Edit due to a revelation when playing Undertale and beating the game on PC) I just realized something. The black chick who calls the character \"Numbskull\" and the idiot from AC: Unity who calls the main character \"Pisspot\" have something in common: They aren't written well at all. While I was playing Undertale for the billionth time, I realized something: Undyne calls the player \"Punk\" sometimes. Sure, she may be similar to the poorly written characters, but the difference is obvious: the fish monster is written than two humans. She doesn't call the player \"Punk\" until AFTER becoming friends. Both the black chick and idiot from AC: Unity call the player their respected nicknames at the start, rather than after developing them.\n-See the cover art for this game? See how Shay has that awesome coat and hood? Well, that coat is in the game, but the hood is not. Ya, I know this is a petty con, but I expect the COVER ART for the game to feature content WITHIN the game.

So after a while I buckled and bought this game and I have to say that I was not disapointed. This game built on everything that was great about Black Flag and put more on top. While some feature of Black Flag are not included, being able to weild four pistols and being able to dive for treasure, it honestly didn't drag down the expirence.  I logged about 49 hours on this game so far, I finished the story in about 35 hours, taking my time going for upgrades and becoming slightly obssed with the fleet missions. However the two most disapointing aspects of this game I would have to say is the way that you are yanked out of the Animus, ruining the immmersion. Secondly the fact that this time around outfits are disapointing and require you to make all this effort with slight benifits.

With a creative story that gives you different perspectives of the Templars and the Assassins, this story shows that Ubisoft still knows how to make creative adventures that will keep you playing (Although the plot does get predictable towards the end) . Also it is cool to see some of my favorite characters from AC 3 and Black Flag make a return to the series. While I do have to say that there are some new weapons and combat mechanics (Grenade Launcher, Being Boarded by ships, New Ship Weapons) that make the game more fun, Rogue is more of a mix of AC 3 and Black Flag. If you did not enjoy those two games, do not buy Rogue. But if you enjoyed any one of the two, I recommend Rogue as your AC game this year (since there is not one coming out the year 2016). Just remember that this game is way shorter than previous AC games. If you are new to the franchise, I recommend starting out with Black Flag or some of the earlier non ship games (Brotherhood,AC 2) to find your preference.\n7.5/10\nRecommended for AC 3 and Black Flag fans", "hours": 9.5, "user_id": "76561198095500871", "username": "64hoops", "products": 102, "early_access": false}

Mainly, the naval combat of IV is here in full gear, even improving it a bit. And the overall setting and locations are inspired on III. Let me clarify. In this game, there's 3 main locations. First, there's the icy North Atlantic, which is your main playground for the excellent naval combat. There's an open sea with plenty of icebergs, and winter locations to explore. Secondly, there's the River Valley, where despite the ability to travel with your ship, naval combat is almost non-existent. Instead this area is reminiscent of the frontier in III, with more locations to explore and in bigger forest areas. And lastly, there's the city of New York. However, it doesn't feel like a ripoff of III's New York, and i think this New York is more cohesive. However, there isn't much to do in here, besides some missions and collectibles. So, there's a place for naval combat, a forest place and a city place. And this game doesn't need more than that. The gameplay is what you'd expect, but the developers added some new things. For example, this time your ship can also be boarded by the enemy, and you'll be hunted by assassin's. And speaking of which, the story is really good, with an interesting main character and with new and returning side characters. You'll have a better experience if you have played the previous titles. But the story is a bit short, unfortunately. To 100% the game, there's a lot of collectibles scattered around, and it'll get repetitive after a while. The soundtrack is also decent. The graphics show some age today, but they are good considering that this was a 7th generation game. In the end, this game is a great choice if you want more of the amazing naval combat, even if it's mostly more of the same. Because even with the added content, you won't like this game if you don't like the franchise. But still, a surprisingly good game nonetheless.", "hours": 67.4, "username": "jpsf91", "products": 636, "early_access": false}

Chronologically, the bulk takes place between AC4 and AC3, bridging the gap between the two.\nGameplay and story wise it takes the best of both games and blends them together to create something that fans of either game can enjoy, whether its the open world sailing and piracy of AC4 or the dark colonial story of AC3.\nThis time, however, you play as a templar, giving you an up close and personal look at their operations, ideology, and methods. Portraying them as keepers of the piece and status quo in the rather anarchic world of the fledgling American colonies. In this way it portrays them in a new and sympathetic light as opposed to the Saturday morning cartoon villain treatment they got in the Ezio Trilogy, or the manipulative puppet master treatment they got in virtually every other game in the series.\nIn addition Familiar faces return as new allies and enemies including Haytham, Achilles, and Adewale.\nThis being said there are a few drawbacks to AC: Rogue. The Collection quests are a bit of a frustration as the items you get for competing them are only marginally better or not unlockable until after the main story has been completed. In addition, the hardest legendary ship battle requires precision timing that some may not be able to achieve with keyboard and mouse controls.\nOverall, Assassin's Creed Rogue is a great game with only a few minor drawbacks that provides a fresh and sympathetic look at the series traditional villains the Templars.", "hours": 66.7, "user_id": "76561197984754518", "username": "(SCG) Baxyratty", "products": 312, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 114, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-01-19", "text": "Honestly, using AC III + IV + icebergs to sum up Rogue is not patronising, at all. Alternatively, as many have already put it in various reviews, Black Flag 1.5 is also a good alternative name for this entry of the Assassin's Creed series. Or, the way I call it, it is Black Flag Winter Edition which should be considered an expansion - if you remember this fancy word from before the introduction of DLCs and Season Passes. An expansion pack always upped the ante of the original game by adding new stuff and a bit of a higher difficulty level but - ultimately - a shorter story to complete.\nNow, the above means that if you really want to play something new - i.e. have the next generation Assassin's Creed experience - you have to skip this one and move to Unity where you have the next-gen graphics and the new characteristics such as new gameplay elements and a completely new storyline in a new setting. However, do bear in mind that if you do so, you'll leave two of the greatest assets of the AC series (so far) behind:\n1) a memorable protagonist who - unlike his predecessors before - joins the templars and kills assassins\n2) the naval combat that was first introduced in AC III but we saw its full potential only in Black Flag\nNow, Shay Cormac's story is - for me - very interesting from start to finish. The reason why he leaves the assassins and joins the templars made sense and I found it intriguing. And no, he doesn't just make up his mind and by joining the templars does not start desperately searching for his old pals from the brotherhood to eliminate them once and for all. It is a little bit more complicated than that - all the more reason to believe the assassins' and templars' ongoing (never-ending) conflict cannot be described as the story of Good vs Evil, Yin and Yang, etc. Shay's story is worth seeing it through till the very end.\nGameplay-wise, at one point when you turn and join the templars strolling in various settlements becomes even more exciting - you are hunted by assassins! The hay cart, for instance, your favourite spot for hiding, can now be occupied by assassins who are constantly looking for hurting you. You will not get desynced immediately if you fail to notice them in time but their one stab can significantly reduce your health. Your Eagle Vision helps you notice them from afar and when the vision is turned on you have the same compass helping you locate them than the one you used in the competitive multiplayer mode (which is now completely missing from this instalment).\nToo bad the game is ridiculously easy this time. With all the easy counter system and the sleeping / berserk darts it was already very easy, however, Shay now is in possession of a grenade launcher. While two of its firing modes basically mean the same sleeping / berserk dart solution (but with area effect), an exploding grenade as the last resort is also available for you. AC couldn't have gotten any more steampunk, right?\nThere's also an interesting activity / side mission type labelled assassin interception: you first find their target then within the allotted time you need to find all assassins. This search mainly goes for the bonus - if you are unsuccessful the would-be victim will start their walk towards their destination and while along the way you can still protect the person - you'll just have a more challenging time.\nThe rest is pretty much the same. In fact, the creators desperately tried to introduce new stuff such as the destructible icebergs during naval battles that can harm other (mainly smaller) ships. Or the new narwal whale whose tusk is a must to craft some pretty nifty outfits / upgrades to your inventory. Since the North Atlantic map is constantly giving you the winter season it's better to remember not to swim for long as Shay can freeze to death! Also, the penguin effect looks great!\nAbout maps: comparing the game to AC III is obvious once Shay sets foot in New York. And while we - again - have two maps with lots of water only one of them focuses on the ocean. The so-called River Valley has - well - a valley with long canals and many small settlements and the area is full of hills and mountains.\nSo, is Rogue worth the purchase?\n+++ Yes, 3 new maps accompanied by a new story and so far - arguably - with the most interesting protagonist this time.\n+++ Once again the open world is quite big with dozens of collectible items and to have everything found and obtain almost all achievements it took me 60 hours. Not bad for an \"expansion\", right?\n+++ It nicely connects some dots - references can be found to AC III, IV as well as for Unity.\nSo, no negatives then? A must-have in the franchise?\n--- While Shay's story feels unique it is much shorter. We have half of the memory sequences now compared to previous entries in the series. Make no mistake the game has its applicable pace to tell the story (not rushed, at all) but since there are so many collectibles I would have expected the same amount of main missions, too, for accompaniment purposes.\n--- There's nothing really new here beside the story. Some new side missions / activities and what the winter season can add to the gameplay. It is not necessarily bad but since everything is more of the same the annoying stuff remains, too: the occasionally annoying target selection during naval battles (when you board a ship) and the too easy gameplay - there's next to no challenge once Shay gets his hands on the grenade launcher.\nRogue is a must have for all AC fans! The rest of you can just decide based on above review or by reading some more - after all, while I consider this more of an expansion its price tag could be a bit lower due to the same.", "hours": 61.5, "username": "CorvusCorax", "products": 687, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Achievements or any other Steam integration might have helped a little but Ubisoft rather add their Uplay garbage instead.\nYou play as a Templar most of the game but it doesn't change up the formula much, for some reason the Assassins start behaving just like the Templars used to with big visible forts and such. It's a little weird and a missed opportunity gameplay-wise. There are a couple bones thrown in like being hunted by hidden assassins but that really just serves to fill your ear with creepy and annoying whispering and doesn't add much.\nThe story is really good but way too short. It seems like they cut a lot of it or it just wasn't fully worked out, I wanted to see more but it just rushes you through. It might be the most interesting story in the whole series about the series itself, it pulls a lot of pieces together and for that you should play it if you are into it.\nOtherwise this is just an overpriced bit of standalone DLC and I was mostly dissapointed given the hidden gem status this game has.

Shay Cormac was young and idealistic. But throughout his life, he remained loyal and compassionate.\nAs a hardy AC fan, I was reluctant to get this as this is the story of an Assassin going rogue, turning coats and crossing over to the dark side - especially since I heard great things about Rogue. But I had never been more wrong or more clear in my love for this game and the others\nPrevious AC games were quite 'traditional' in the sense where the bad guys were bad and were easy to hate. But as said in my review of AC3, it started to blur the lines. This is where the Kenway line comes in. Beginning from Connor and Haytham in AC3, the grey areas of the Assassin-Templar conflict shift and change. It is not just about right and wrong anymore, but the means and intentions of achieving peace and such.\nThis is the story of a man living in time when the Assassin Brotherhood struggled hard to maintain righteousness. This game truly sets the tone of the question - 'Are all Templars evil? Are all Assassins' good?' From here on out, its a devil's trap, and you cannot help but see the grey and its A LOT harder to pick sides\nGameplay is much the same as the AC3, AC4 world. The naval combat and ground combat is the same as before, but set in a new and crisp environment. The graphics are way more stable than Black Flag, with no point in gameplay where glitch nor bug appeared - for me at least. The famously annoying amount of collectibles has returned, and its up to you if you wish to catch them all.\nPlot is the compelling masterpiece. Not only does this tie in AC3 and AC4, but also a branch into the French Revolution in AC Unity. By this point, it would be good to mention - for maximum emotional impact, to play this first prior to ACU. Shay's story is dark and riddled with emotional turmoil. Betraying his former ideals and betrayed by his own brothers - the Creed is suddenly dark and unforgiving, something not seen since the Altair days.\nSet in the Seven Years war which was a significant historical event which arguably was the impetus of the fall of the British hold on America - starting the American Revolution, and also the fall of the monarchy - kicking of the French Revolution. During this time, you will understand why Achilles in AC3 was so bitter and sad, how he learned life the hard way, and why he tries so hard to make Connor see it too. In this time, you feel the echoes of Black Flag, with the confrontation of Adewale, and his former captain's son. This game shows you the effects of the novelisation of AC3, Forsaken - Haytham choosing Templars over his conscious self and turning aside emotions.\nShay has to cut and kill his way through friends and family, to protect the world from pride and war. The Assassins are no longer the good guys, and Shay - a new Templar, is seemingly the only one more concerned with the lives of innocents than the conflict itself.\nSomething most other Assassins cannot say they have done.\nBy the end of this, though short but bittersweet, the emotional wallop is compelling.

At first I didn't want to give the Assassin's Creed franchise another shot, but I'd heard good things about Rogue and seeing it was a year old already and quite a bargain I thought to myself, why the hell not. So I bought it and I don't regret it.\nYou play as a templar this time, which is pretty interesting, though it took me a while to get along with that - I always really liked the assassins and betraying them felt kinda... awful. But I started to grow fond of Shay Comac, he's a bit of an idiot, but likeable. The story, too, is quite interesting - at least while you're in the animus. I never really cared much for the stuff you do at Abstergo.\nWhat I really enjoyed in Rogue was the map you got. They gave you all kinds of stuff to explore: you get New York City, the rich landscapes of the Riverlands and the icy cold North Atlantic with a lot of bad weather, fish to hunt and ships to board. I've loved Black Flag for its marine missions, and I wasn't let down by Rogue on that. I spent so much time on the water, because it just felt pretty damn good.\nHowever, Rogue, like any other of the latest Assassin's Creed games (though I haven't played Syndicate), is just that: an Assassin's Creed game. It's not really all that different. The only thing that makes it stand out from the others is the afore mentioned fact that you're a templar now. Ergo you have assassin's following you like all the time (which got annoying pretty soon, they aren't hard to find or to kill, but there's just so many of them, it bored me).\nRogue isn't as special as it'd like to be, but still worth playing if you've liked previous AC games.

This new installment tells a new story which is slightly similar to that of Black Flag itself but gameplay wise is everything Black Flag was meant to be, not at all taking from Black Flag as I in fact loved that episode of AC being a historical fan of pirates in real life, Black Beard being my favourite of all pirates and was a really big thing for me to see him in-game.\nPart of me is unsure as to which storyline is better, Black Flag or Rogue? Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too. Needs to be more games based from the villains angle. Playing as a Templar agent is quite bad \u2665\u2665\u2665.\nEven if you are new to Assassins Creed this storyline will be easy to get on board with however I strongly recommend playing the earlier AC's to really soak up the depth of it all as this series takes on a whole new universe of it's own and the overall storyline for Assassins Creed is quite interesting to say the least and honestly worthy of a high budget film (lets just hope they don't \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it up).\nSome of the things that still annoy me about AC to this day and still seem to be an issue I find throughout game is when the parkour spazzes out and simple jumps just cause you to derp out and get stuck which in some situations is highly frustrating but for the most part the engine runs quite smoothly and situations as I have just mentioned happen quite rarely but when they do happen you will know exactly what I am talking about. I have also witnessed AI glitch into objects and become unresponsive or simply get stuck and start running in a spot which allowed me to meta-game kinda a few situations and exploit a bugged AI to my advantage but even this I have only seen maybe three times in my time playing.", "hours": 39.0, "user_id": "76561198129380421", "username": "JayBlue", "products": 148, "early_access": false}

It's nice having the story told from the bad guy's perspective, but it doesn't make them look like the bad guys.  The biggest jerk in the AC series, Achilles, gets what's coming to him & explains why he becomes such a degenerate do-nothing weener in AC3.\nIt plays exactly like Black Flag, so I wasn't interested in doing all the side quests and extra stuff as it's basically a rehash of AC4.  Even some of the shanty songs are the same.  I didn't spend much time upgrading everything since it was made from the same game, and as a result, the game is pretty short.  The main story, while good, is extremely short.  If you're not doing all the extra sidequests, be prepared for a short game.\nThe rest:\nHaytham Kenway has still done nothing wrong and this further proves that Connor should've sided with Daddy in AC3 over that worthless turd Achilles.  Shay is a good guy, doing good things, for the bad guys and quite possibly, the wrong reasons.  Despite him being right and Achilles being wrong, Achilles still doesn't learn humility at the end of the game and calls him out for a \"lack of respect\" which just about made me yell \"oh \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 off you waste of life\".\nI hated Achilles in AC3 and he's an even worse character in this game (on purpose though) and while I know Connor did the right thing & sided with the good guys in AC3, it made me mad that he did it so hastily and they never explored what it would've been like if he had sided with Haytham instead.

Considering that Black Flag is considered one of the best in the series (My personal favorites include BF and Brotherhood), it would make sense that they would try to make that lightning strike twice. The product we have is a shorter, slim version of Black Flag.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing. Black Flag was plagued with one issue: It was riddled with \"Follow the people and eavesdrop\" which was one of the most annoying things I had to endure. It balanced out with greatly refined Naval combat (First introduced in AC3 but did next to nothing for you) and colorful characters that you empathized with and care about. They're trying to do the same thing in Rogue but with a smaller cast and more streamlined combat.\nFor example, metal was a commodity in BF that you had to cause a ruckus at sea and get wanted levels to face against higher level enemies. In Rogue, -every- enemy ship carries metal and you'll find your ship upgrade a hell of a lot quicker than in BF.\nThe same idea translates to the main story which hauls\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Every mission seems to throw 5% completion on my save file. In ten hours you may very well already be at 50% completion which seems a bit short considering it's original asking price (I pre-ordered the deluxe, which is a bit cheaper now).\nIn essence, they trimmed the pointless fat of Black Flag but failed to replace it with substance or content, but that's still not a dealbreaker if you left BF thinking \"I wish there was more sea stuff\". Even then, Rogue didn't add much to it, but instead gave you more reasons to do it. If that makes sense.\nStorywise, it's actually one of the more interesting ones. I still care very little about the \"modern day\" aspect of the games (Though I'm happy Desmond is out of the picture) but we're put in the shoes of an Assassin that witnessed (And unwittingly caused) a great disaster because the Assassins are meddling in things they don't completely comprehend, and did not take Shay Cormac's words in account when he is distressed at the mess they caused. After being shot off a cliff, Shay then meets several Templars that seem to refrain from the usual \"Kick the dog\" moments of series past and still press their goals with all the manipulation involved. Shay is out to stop the assassins from making more of a mess and keep them from accidentally (Or purposefully) murdering thousands of people at a time.\nThe story is clearly painted with the \"Templars aren't really that bad, okay?\" brush, but still offers the opposite opinion that I had been waiting for. We get a little more of that in Unity with Elise, who also isn't a knee-breaking lunatic.\nUltimately it's a great game. It's Black Flag: Templar edition. It's not as expensive as it was, so nab it now or on sale. It's not a bad buy if you're a fan of the franchise.", "hours": 25.6, "username": "WTWR Zydrate", "products": 390, "early_access": false}

The only difference is that the Templars are now represented as the good guys, repairing the society that has been destroyed by Assassin-financed gang practices. If the point of this game was to show that the Assassin's Creed has its issues, whereas the Templar order also makes some credible points, they could and should have done this better. The story suffers from a serious lack of depth. There is no real ideological reason for Shay (the main character) to switch sides, just a methodological one. This seems to be a highly insufficient reason to do so. Furthermore, Shay's anger towards Achilles seems to be highly misplaced. He gets unreasonably angry at him because of a mistake, not a wrongdoing. This makes his reason for breaking with the Assassins an emotional, immature one, not a rational one. Hell, he didn't even decide to really discuss the matter with Achilles before attempting to entirely sabotage the brotherhood's progress.\nThat being said, the gameplay heavily relies on Black Flag, but that's allright by me. It works fine, and I primarily play Assassin's Creed games because of the narrative anyway.

And the Templars don't have any better motivation in their grand plan other than just combating the efforts of the Assassins.\nThe modern day storyline is similar to Black Flag in that you play as another nameless, faceless Abstergo Entertainment employee who gets to go around providing IT support for coworkers while they're away from their desks. Every now and then you're pulled back to modern day to run an errand and find some misplaced iPads and then you get to go back to Shay.

It added many new weapons from its predecessor (Black Flag), though the only one which was actually really *new* was the grenades, and added an admittedly interesting gas mechanic to the game. It also was much more filled and felt significantly less grindy than Black Flag; these were all great improvements to the series from the previous title, but unfortunately, these are the only positive things I can say about this game. What this game made up for in being playable, it lost in a dissapointing lack of charm.\n**The remainder of this review contains massive spoilers, referrencing the end of the game**\nEither due to false marketing on the community's behalf or on Ubisoft, we're lead to believe that the main character, Shay, is the victim of a massive betrayal and seeks revenge against the brotherhood. This story sounded interesting, and for many of us, it was the first time we'd see the story from a Templar's point of view. Or at least, that's what I expected, but not what I recieved. Shay was never the victim of a betrayal, but rather the victim of a mistake in which no one was guilty. Rather than confront his Mentor about what he witnessed, which would be the logical thing to do, Shay gets unrealistically emotional about the situation and blames everything on his Mentor. He then consciously decides to betray his brotherhood, and is retaliated against accordingly.\nWhat follows isn't a story of revenge against the backstabbing brotherhood, but rather a convoluted scheme to stop a man who ends up listening to his own conscience in the end anyways, rendering Shay's entire mission completely pointless. He decides, for no other reason than one of the British officers was nice to him while he was injured, to help his hated rivals, the Templars, and eventually join their Order and assist the British in winning the Seven Years War.\nMy biggest complain about this game is that under no point of this game do you ever see the positives in joining the Templar Order. The Templars were never painted as the good guys, rather the game regularly reminds you that they are the bad guys, and the reasons for Shay's complete dedication toward the Order seems to entirely ignore his high moral stance which directed him to betray the Assassins. There never seems to be a point, other than the rosey tone of a single man who dies before Shay even makes the decision to join the Templars, where I (the player) feel like I should actually want to be a Templar.\nAs if the feeling of \"why on Earth am I killing the good guys?\" wasn't enough to make the game feel horrible, the ending seals this game as completely unnecessary and makes no sense. I'm not referring to the mission in Versailles (though the mission itself feels like an unnecessary and shoe-horned-in shameless advertisement for Unity), but rather the Naval Missions. I was quite confused while trying to complete the Naval Missions (which must be completed if you are to unlock much of the best stuff in the game) in that they no longer let you complete them until you \"progress further into the story.\" This was right before the last mission of the game.\nIn case that wasn't clear, let me restate this: The final 5 Naval Missions, which are required for completion and for unlocking some of the best gear in the game, doesn't get unlocked until you've COMPLETED the game. Why? Were the developers afriad that I'd be cheating with Alt\u00efar's Swords on a mission which doesn't even let you use anything other than your Hidden Blades? Why was this required? So that people would be forced to play hours more of the game after they already completed the story? Who thought this was a good idea??\nOverall, I think the game is fine. I never felt like I was doing the right thing, but so what? Plenty of games let you play as the bad guy (though they usually leave out the high sense of morality that constantly reminds you that what you did was morally sketchy and highlights that you're actually the bad guy in this game). The Naval Missions is a cheap and pathetic move on the fault of the developers, but hey, **at least the game plays on PC, Montreal!!**. But would I recommend it, though? No. It doesn't add much from Black Flag, and unlike this game, Black Flag had characters I actually could **care** about. I couldn't have cared less if the characters died; the fact that two of them were Haythem Kenway and Achilles Davenport defeated the possibility of that happening anyways. Comparing that to Black Flag, or more accurately Black Beard, it was geniunely disastrous watching Edward Thatch die. We had actually come to care about him and his death was genuinely devastating. In AC: Rogue, however, none of the characters invoke that amount of compassion. None of the characters seemed to have any real life. When they died, it was difficult to really think anything of it.\nThis game is fine, but you'd be better off playing Black Flag. \"", "hours": 3.7, "user_id": "76561197970414679", "username": "WJAS", "products": 1453, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 119, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-01-03", "text": "Assassin's Creed: Rogue is a strange outing for the series, serving as a spinoff, an \"interquel\" (chronologically between AC4 and most of AC3), and something of a last hurrah for the series before it stepped into the next generation (and unfortunately tripped and fell with the release of Unity). It's a game I have very mixed feelings about, for while it is undeniably a good game, I can't help but feel some sense of disappointment, as I think it could have been so much better...\nPerformance: It works!!! After the absolute disaster that was Unity, I refused to buy another AC game for PC without waiting to see the community's response (Still can't get Unity to work for me over a year later). Obviously Ubisoft is making an effort to improve their treatment of PC releases, as this game runs, for the most part, beautifully on my machine with the graphics settings pretty much maxed out, and I run it on a laptop with a core i7, 2.5 Ghz processer, and an AMD HD8970 graphics card, so we're not talking about a particularly beastly computer here. The only real issue I encountered was a consistent crash to desktop as soon as the game started, unless I set the environment quality to normal, which seems to have been a somewhat widespread problem. However, this issue was easily resolved and hasn't affected my enjoyment of the game at all, so I'd say it's mostly negligible.\nGraphics: The game looks beautiful, with some really breathtaking environments. Assassin's Creed is one of the only games that after years of play, I still find myself just stopping and looking around at the environment, in awe of the level of detail and love that went into crafting these historical recreations. Of particular note here are the stunningly reflective waters of the Riverlands, and the sprawling and lively cityscape of New York. With that in mind, however, it should be noted that many of the models and animations are ripped directly out of previous entries in the series. A lot of what you see comes from AC3 or AC4, and while this didn't bother me in most cases, one thing that greatly disappointed me was the animation set for Shay, the main protagonist. Almost all of his combat finishers and free-running movements are virtually identical to Edward Kenway's animations from AC4, who already borrowed animations from Connor in AC3. It really took away from Shay's characterization, and I found it especially disappointing considering Ubisoft went to the trouble of crafting new animations for Adewale in Freedom Cry, which was merely a DLC expansion for Black Flag. You'd think a full release with a new protagonist would get special treatment, but instead they just lazily recycled animations we've already seen before. Bad form, Ubisoft.\nSound and Music: I got chills when I started up this game and heard the opening theme. This brilliant piece weaves together themes from throughout the series' history, including the AC3 main theme, \"Ezio's Family\" from AC2, and a very Irish take on what sounds like the \"British Empire\" theme from Black Flag. It really brings on the nostalgia for the greatest moments of the series, and leads you to believe that you're about to witness a pivotal moment in the series' overarching plot (sadly, this doesn't quite come to fruition). Overall, the music is really great in this game, epic and grandiose, and I loved the Irish flavor they brought to the table to accompany the series' first Irish protagonist. As always, they really hit the nail on the head here. As for sound effects and voice acting, you'll hear a lot of familiar sounds from AC4, which didn't need improvement, and the voice acting is as good as ever.\nStory: To me, this is where the game really failed to deliver. We were promised a plot that would turn the series on its head, showing us the world from the perspective of the Templars, blurring the lines and making us see the humanity in both sides. Unfortunately, I would argue that the opening sequences of AC3 already accomplished that much better than this game ever did. I wanted to like Shay Cormac, our rogue-ish hero, but I just never really cared all that much. Especially after the emotional rollercoaster of Edward Kenway's pirate adventures in AC4, everything here just felt cold and disconnected. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that Shay's motivations for defecting to the Templar's just didn't make sense, and the portrayal of the Templars seemed completely off-base compared to the rest of the series. The game just tries too hard to make you like them, and instead of feeling like we're getting a closer look at the humanity within the Templar cause, it just feels like the same old \"honorable, compassionate good guys\" vs \"cold, inhumane bad guys\" story we've experienced before, only with the names of the factions switched.\nThere's also a modern day story in between sequences, but it's largely uninteresting (though Osto Berg does seem like an intriguing character), and the little pieces of lore you find  by hacking computers seem more like Assassin's Creed wiki entries to flesh out popular characters than anything else. I miss the mystery of deciphering Subject 16's encoded messages in AC2, and even the hacked information in AC4 had some level of intrigue that's largely missing here.\nGameplay: It's Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag through and through. Almost nothing has changed in terms of mechanics. You'll still free-run and counter kill your way across the land, and you'll still sail for miles and engage in furious naval battles across the North Atlantic. However, the series does add in some new features. Shay has a couple unique weapons, the air rifle and the grenade launcher. The air rifle is virtually identical to the blowgun from AC4, but it's still a cool weapon. The grenade launcher, however, is new. You can fire sleep grenades, berserk grenades, or shrapnel grenades, and it can be great fun to fire one into a group of enemies from a high tree branch and watch chaos ensue. Otherwise, however, Shay's weapons are pretty much the same as Edward's.\nAnother new feature is the new Stalker enemies. They will hide in places traditionally reserved for yourself as the Assassin. You can find them using a compass-like indicator only available using Eagle Vision. Then, you can either walk by and let them come at you, only to counter-kill them, or you can smoke them out and hunt them down. It makes traversing the city more interesting and more dangerous, as the Stalkers can pose a real threat if they get a hit in.\nA lot of the game will be spent at sea, sailing and engaging in naval combat, and it's as fun as ever. Shay's ship, the Morrigan, is notably faster and more maneuverable than the Jackdaw from AC4, which really helps streamline the naval gameplay. The ship is also equipped with new weapons. The first is the Puckle Gun, an automatic side-gun that actually makes boarding ships too easy, as you'll probably take out all the enemy crew before your ship even gets close enough to jump over. The second new weapon is the burning oil, which allows you to leave trails of fire behind you, and is much more effective in losing a tail than the explosive kegs from previous games. Finally, you get an upgraded ram that allows you to actually control your charge. Another new naval feature worth mentioning is that you can now be boarded by enemy ships if they ram into you, which is a surprisingly exciting and chaotic experience.\nBesides the main missions, there's a ton of side content. You can conquer the gangs of New York, raid forts, hunt animals to craft upgrades, and pick up a ton of various collectibles, including chests, animus fragments, the new prosperities which increase your income, viking swords, templar crosses, and more. The naval campaign also makes its return, and if you're really bored, you can just go play checkers at a bar.\nMy final score: 7/10 Great game in many ways, but I'd probably wait til it's on sale to pick it up.", "hours": 38.3, "username": "graywolf2007", "products": 273, "early_access": false}

I've always loved the franchise, with very few exceptions. When Rogue and Unity released, I only played Unity because at the time, I had an Xbox One and not a 360. I was so disappointed with Unity...they changed everything and made it ten times worse, the story was boring, and in the beginning, the game was incredibly broken. I was worried that Rogue would be much of the same, since they released at the same time.\nI am so, so happy I was wrong.\nRogue is a lot like Black Flag in the mechanics and world exploration. Rogue doesn't focus quite as heavily on naval battles, but they are still an option, and still a lot of fun. The story was wonderful, especially since you met a lot of characters from previous games, and learned what their individual journeys were like. I feel like Rogue was the game we should have received instead of Assassin's Creed 3. Connor's story was really just there to introduce us to Haytham, who was such a big influence on the way history transpired. Of course, the mechanics still leave a lot to be desired, but they are a whole hell of a lot better than 3 or Unity, for sure. The main, big target killing missions were more like free-run chase missions, but after thinking about it, I'm not surprised. A rogue assassin that is attacking former allies that are also assassins...they all know tricks to elude fights.\nI was also happy with this game because it was more like going back to the roots of the Assassin's Creed franchise...the story just felt more in line with things we hadn't seen since Altair, with our protagonist really questioning the things he was led so blindly to believe. It's been very interesting to see how the Templar and Assassin lines are developing, and with all the news that is being released in each game, it makes me think that a future installment will have a big twist with us having worked with the wrong side of the Assassain/Templar War.\nTLDR; Rogue feels more like a game that was developed with the franchise's roots in mind; great story line, 9/10", "hours": 25.2, "user_id": "76561198070544459", "username": "Valkyriona", "products": 53, "early_access": false}

Yet... I dunno, yeah, it is getting tiring to see the same stuff over and over again each year, but ACreed somehow keeps the formula interesting enough. Don't ask me how, even I don't know, but I can safely say that for the most part, every ACreed game is alright at the least. In 2014, however, AC Unity was released and was a buggy mess. I can't comment on that game but I haven't played it yet. But that same year, Ubisoft released their last ACreed game for the old gen software, Rogue. So I got the two in the sale and started up Rogue. After finishing it, I decided to start up a review. So what did I think? Well, ain't that the purpose of this review? Let's take a look.\nSTORY: Your name is Shay Patric Cormack. You are an Assassin working in the American colonies... or, at least, you were. After you might've caused Lisbon to have a massive earthquake after retrieving an artifact on orders of the Assassin's, you end up leaving the Assassins and you join the Templars. You end up going after your old friends from your former Assassin bretheren to get the equipment that they used to find the artifacts that did this. It is a very different story, and it did keep me entertained, but... I dunno, I wouldn't call it that good. I mean, it isn't bad, heck, I say it's decent, but it really doesn't keep you interested half the time. The other half, it is pretty interesting, but still. But it's alright, so I won't complain. It takes place during the Seven Years War in that period in between 3 and you also see\n, so that's kind of neat.\nGAMEPLAY: Same gameplay, different game. Literally, since this is just AC Black Flag in AC3's location. You have ship battles, sneaky assassinations, usual stuff. One thing that is new is the new Assassin Hunt feature. There might be an assassin hiding at places you go. You have to go into eagle sense in order to figure this out, then follow a little compass- like that points you to where they are hiding. This is a neat feature, and I know they can't add it to the usual ACreed games, but if they do this idea again they should readd it. It was fun. The rest of the stuff is alright. Don't fix it if it ain't broke, I guess. Kept me occupied for 27 hours (I know game says 19, but steam glitched out) so not bad.\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Don't expect an amazing looking game like Unity. This was built for last gen. That said, the game looks pretty good. There are nice little details like snow particles and fish in ponds, and that's nice to see. Game runs well due to the old gen thing as well, which is sweet. If your rig can't run AAA games above 20, this might run at around 40-50FPS, not on Ultra, but Normal with a bit of AA on. So that's nice.\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Voice acting is top notch as usual. The character arc of Shay is kind of interesting to see. All main characters are well designed and there's nothing to complain that I can think of. Maybe repetative NPC design, but that's passable for a last gen game.\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Nothing special, basically the baby between 3 and Black Flag, but it's a good game. 7/10, alright game. If you like the AssCreed games, pick this up. If you want to start off with the ACreed series, try 4, it doesn't have Desmond, so you'll be fine, if not, this might not be the worst place to start. If you're tired of these games or never liked them, though, this won't change your mind.", "hours": 18.7, "username": "dogboat333", "products": 253, "early_access": false}

Shey is a relatable character and you definitely care about the characters by the end. there is an over world like in black flag with its own charecters and plot. script was good set pieces were good voice acting was good bla bla bla. the exciting part is it beautifully pulls together assassins creed 3 4 and unity in a marvelous way by the end. no spoilers. if you have played all three of those games and then moved on to unity and syndicate and felt jostled or like you missed the jump that's because you didn't play this game. really i cant stress how cool it was to see the missing link here. i really don't want to spoil anything so i'm going to move to closing.\nthis game marks the end of in my opinion the second trilogy of assassins creed. hear my out. this is the last of the last gen assassins creed games and it really feels that way. you have assassins creed 1 which was a proof of concept and kind of a stepping stone to get away from the prince of Persia. the ezio trilogy self explanatory. then came 3. where 1 and 2 drooped you in a city that you got to explore through out the game (or 1 of like 3 major cities) 3 introduced a more open platform. they gave you some land to traverse. it really made you feel like the journey was more important then the destination. black flag definitely followed suit on that. it was all about exploring islands and sailing on your bad\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665boat and being a pirate. rouge as i have said is more black flag and there you have it. the second trilogy. to bring it home rouge is a more mature black flag. they fixed the awful tailing missions and really focused more on narrative then the characters. it marks a clear end of an era and syndicate and unity start a new one. we probably wont ever get another game like black flag or rouge and that's OK. we have gone back to 1 big open city and that's fine.  rouge doesn't make you feel sad to see it go. you feel a sense of closure. a sense of fulfillment. like saying goodbye to an old friend. i really liked this game and i really recommend it to any fan of the series.", "hours": 25.5, "user_id": "76561198025598976", "username": "dsnerdking", "products": 166, "early_access": false}

I really hate having to grind through all of the ship combat just to get from A to B.\nI was relieved to arrive in New York and put all that identikit island grinding  behind me but no sooner had I landed then it became clear that most of New York is effectively level-gated and there is no way to earn the requisite powerup without progresssing the main plot.\nNo surprise then that as soon as you land in New York you are whisked off to travel around the same set of identical islands again. Jeeeez.\nThe naval battles pass the time but it remains a massive chore just to travel around the oceans, all those settlements look identical. A journey inland doesn't help and the natural environment is irritatingly inconsistent compared to the towns (can I climb a 100 ft sheer cliff face? yes, as long as there are white marks on the rock. Can I climb a boulder as high as my shoulder? No! That's a natural obstacle.)  The islands are not free-roam paradises, the islands and settlements are simple mazes with one of two fixed routes through them. It's galling that the series still does this with everything outside cities.\nThe NPCs also fare worse than preceeding installments with Benjamin Franklin somehow assuming a prime role yet doing absolutely nothing of value and voice-acted as an irritatingly bumbling fool. If I could I would stab him myself.  The rest of the cast are unfortunately an array of cardboard cutout villians with \"good sides\" that our hero finds out about.\nThe plot is even worse than AC 3 with a meandering campaign chasing after artifacts that no-one seems to know about and pitched so badly that the player is inclined to skip cutscenes. Compared to Unity and to a lesser extent, Syndicate, this really is terrible waffle and unfortunately you are made to spend too much time listening to it.

Having not experienced that game, all of the goodness from Black Flag hits me for the first time because Assassin's Creed Rogue is one of the best games I have played in a long time.\nPro's:\nThere is so much to do. Some of it feels like filler and is not great, but because there is so much, there is also a lot that is fun. There are all kinds of missions, brigandage, ship upgrades, city upgrades, weapon upgrades, achievements, hunting, tomb raiding...you name it. In terms of gameplay content, this game rivals GTA V. It also looks good, especially the waves. Some of the coastal locations are scenic enough to stop you in your tracks and make you take a moment to appreciate them. Some of the music reminds me The Last of The Mohicans, which is awesome. The technical issues are minimal.\nCon's:\nThe two main downsides are the story and the main character. When people saw the trailer for this game, they were worried that the main character was going to be an angsty emo (no one likes those) and I think it didn't turn out to be quite that bad, but the total sum of this guy is still unpleasant. He is a traitor (as the title of the game suggests) and the game keeps reminding you that, which makes me not want to play as him anymore; he is angsty; he kills his friends; he is a hypocrite; he is careless; the voice acting for this guy is bland and  monotone.\nAs for the story. it feels rather forced, starting you off fighting for the Assassins faction and then shoving in the drama in order to forcefully change your course. Just let me play for the Templars from the start, people. Can someone explain to me how this franchise managed to maintain for so long that the group called \"murdurers\" are the good guys?! It irritates me immensely, much more than the silly story, which is why I chose this game to begin with, since it lets you play for the templars. And what does the game do? It forces me to play for the Assassins for the first 20% of the game.\nOne more minor downside is that the game of course has the patented Assassin's Creed climbing, which can be rather annoying when it does not work and it does not work a lot. You'll be chasing someone down the street and suddenly your character gets whisked away to the roof of one of the buildings on your side because you ran too close to one of those quick-climb contraptions and it triggered.\nConclusion:\nIf you can get over the annoyances of the story, then this is one of the better games in existence.

The first is ok but really hard towards the end, seriously that one has some frustrating sword combat, which is amazing considering the cakewalk the combat become in all subsequent games. The second one has the most rounded and fulfilling story and gameplay.\nThen after that one Ubisoft f*cked the modern story sections where you played as Desmond. I'm glad i didn't bother playing revelations or 3. Black Flag was the only game before Rogue that i actually really enjoyed and that i didn't have to force myself to play, and that is mainly due to it being a pirate game first and an Assassins Creed game second.\nRogue is now my favourite Creed game, it has slightly more refined ship to ship combat than Black Flag, and they added smoke effects after you fire your cannons, so you can't see sh*t in front of you, which forces you to use tactics and change position rather than just sit in one spot firing your cannon balls. It also has mainly wintery enivronments as opposed to Black Flags tropical ones.\nThe other cool thing is that this is the first Creed game that has your character join the Templars, so you see most of the game from their point of view which is really cool. There is also one part that without spoiling it caught me completely off guard, i actually can't remember the last time a game had an event happen that genuinely surprised me and was also f*cking awesome.\nIf you have never played a Creed game before then start with Black Flag and then this one. These two games still have all the building climbing and assassinations of the other games, but also when you get bored of doing that you can sail around blowing ships out of the water and harpooning sharks and killer whales to your hearts content.", "hours": 27.5, "user_id": "76561198047672025", "username": "Conker", "products": 570, "early_access": false}

It was realized alongside Unity, but feels much more akin to games from the last few years. There's a sailing sandbox much like Black Flag had, now set during the 7 years War in the 1760's, the hunting and crafting mechnianc that's been there since III and the old \"Capture enemy outposts to claim teroritory\" thing from Brotherhood. So it's pretty much Black Flag 1.5.\nNarratively it's a bit more interesting, picking up from the plot thread in Freedom Cry(the mysterious Templar) Package, Shay Patrick Cormac, is a new assasin who slowly turns his back on them and goes to work for the Templars. The result of which is the destruction of the Colonial Brotherhood, leading into it's miserable state Conner found it in III.\nSo essentially it's a bridge game. It fits in the gap between IV(and Freedom Cry) and III, with a story connection to Unity as well. It fits in much the same way that Revelations did for the Ezio games, in that it's a little different but an awfully lot of the same. Sadly playing as a Templar is much the same as playing as an Assasin, except that every so often the Assasins will pop out of nowhere to try to murder you(though, having played as an assasin, you should have a pretty good idea where they would hide).\nIt's a fine game and an interesting chapter in the series, but it's not going to be anyone's favorite AC game.", "hours": 14.1, "user_id": "76561197991308575", "username": "spauldingae", "products": 360, "early_access": false}

It feels like maybe they skimped on the QA process with this game in order to get it out the door.\nTypically the AC games have had a polished introduction that walks you through all the major concepts, and gives you a good sense of who your character is, but not Rogue. Not only do you have no idea who your character is besides his name and that he's somehow associated with some kind of crew, but this game starts you out on an island where you can start picking up collectibles and treasure maps and all that stuff right off the bat, so it sort of expects you to be familiar with the mechanics... but then later walks you through concepts that you've already done. There were all sorts of questions that remained unanswered (\"Am I an assassin already or am I enroute to becoming one? Who are these other characters around me? How did we get here if the captain's ship is miles away? What are we doing here?\").\nIn the very first intro mission, one of the optional objectives is to not be detected by the guards while you take them all out. However, the game doesn't really explain what constitutes detection. Does the appearance of a red circle indicate detection, or is it only when it's filled, etc...? I hadn't played Black Flag in several months, so I couldn't remember off the top of my head and I restarted that memory several times trying to achieve complete stealth. It was only AFTER all of the mission criteria was completed (rescuing the prisoners, not just killing all the guards) that I was awarded the optional objective. So again, several small things that could have felt a little more smooth, but it was still fun to play.\nThere have been a couple major bugs that I've come across. For example, at the end of one mission, you're suppose to air assassinate a bad guy to get 100% synchronization. However, the guy was stuck in some water and therefore did not go anywhere and could not be air assassinated. I could still shoot him to finish the mission, but if you're the type that likes the 100% success rate, you might need to replay some of the missions. In some cases, I was never informed of a second optional objective until AFTER the mission was finished, making me have to replay it for that 100% rating.\nThere are LOTS of medium-sized, annoying bugs like getting trapped inside a wall, having your body (or other bodies) disappear on rare occasion, and stuff like that. The most annoying bugs have to be the little navigation/free-running bugs, where you are standing next to a completely climbable wall, yet the character will simply refuse to climb unless you run AWAY from the wall and then come back to it. There are also short rock walls that should definitely be climbable (running up them even puts half your body above the next level, but he just falls back down), forcing you to find an even shorter wall. Shay also seems very a little too eager to jump off into the middle of nothingness and fall to his death, even with a perfectly good haystack or other leap-of-faith-catcher mechanism nearby.\nSome bugs are just minor glitches with easy fixes - when I first ran the game on a 1920x1200 monitor in a multi-monitor setup, the setup menu didn't detect my resolution, and so it left it as \"Unknown\" but when I tried to switch to the windowed mode without setting the resolution first, the game would crash. Again, small things, easy fixes.\nAs far as the graphics go, I don't know what other people are whining about with graphics - I think they look pretty good. Maybe people are getting spoiled and expect leaps and bounds with every single new release of a game. I feel like Black Flag was a little brigher and more colorful, whereas Rogue has a more dreary/darker color palette, but it's not like they're bad graphics by any means, and the game runs fantastic with all the settings turned up.", "hours": 58.4, "username": "gr8gonzo", "products": 705, "early_access": false}

You could vary your run speeds between a jog and a sprint which really helped on rooftops making quick 90 degree turns... in this game? You have walk and sprint... no jog. The sprint key is also your parkour key... but if you use spacebar or E with sprint? Cormac will then go into \"unsafe\" parkour jumps or parkour dismounts where he can (AND WILL CONSTANTLY) leap to his death or do something to enrage you greatly. For a game with such an emphasis on parkour? This game is riddled with bugs in so many different town and areas... not being able to straddle a short dirt wall but two feet over Cormac will... if you're trying to do a quick escape and Cormac won't climb a wall because it looked like the 2x4's could be used for climbing? You have to release the SHIFT key and then turn at walking pace before holding SHIFT again or Cormac will endlessly loop trying to climb that same wall since he's so sluggish to turn with SHIFT held down sigh... and getting stuck! I've done an air assassination on a guard poking a hay bale and then Cormac was stuck in a stationary crouch and I couldn't move and guards wouldn't attack me! I had to fast travel elsewhere and lose all my progress on a fortification capture because of that! GRR!!\nNext? The bugs... oh the bugs! Here's polygons floating in the air...\nand more floating polygons same mission...\nMain storyline? I've had to force a mission restart because NPC's would do stuff like attack each other WHEN THEY'RE ON THE SAME TEAM and then they wouldn't continue walking towards our objective and they wouldn't be able to kill each other... or the first time I got a boat on the tutorial mission? I escaped the zone and the prompt kept saying to escape the zone... so I sailed half the map and realized after checking the map that the game was bugged and had to restart the mission sigh...\nHere's Colonel Monroe fighting his own men..\nRestart the mission? They get along just fine and walk in formation...\nSo yeah... buggy, frustrating parkour system which is bugged compared to Black Flag... which is a shame since the storyline is actually good and it's refreshing to see a story from the Templars side of things... but... these bugs will make you give your monitor the middle finger a lot... so unless it's really... and I mean REALLY cheap and you really want an AC game as a Templar? Then and only then bother to buy this game. I bought it for $15 and I feel it was ok for $15... but I feel I should at least try and rush through the game and finish the storyline so at least I feel like I got my $15 worth.\nHere I fight the floating pistol and sword in holsters...\nMy adversary the floating pistol and swords return in a different fight!\nAC Syndicate might have a terribly optimized game engine compared to AC Rogue... but the core gameplay is a lot more solid and I've only experienced bugs with tackling and kidnapping which were minor compared to this game and the parkour is amazing on AC Syndicate... I'd rather play a game I cap my framerate on purpose to 30fps and have worse performance than a game that runs good but the gameplay is bugged like crazy...\nOh, another prime example of the lack of care put into AC Rogue? You know how AC IV Black Flag had that companion app for iOS and Android to control Kenway's fleet? Well, Cormac's fleet in AC Rogue doesn't get the same treatment... no companion app. sigh.", "hours": 16.8, "username": "ThE_MarD", "products": 802, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

That being said, I'm quite disappointed with this game. I have had nothing but problems while playing it. This has probably the WORST combat and parkour mechanics in the entire series. They're so bad, I just finished a Frontier Clash with so many problems, I felt the need to immediately review this game. Here are a few examples of how the combat and parkour are atrocious:\n-you will sheathe your weapons IN THE MIDDLE of combat. Shay just sheathed his swords 4 times while enemies were still around me during the Frontier Clash\n-it's almost impossible to fluidly attack people without an NPC getting in between you and your opponent during a skirmish\n-even if you have a target highlighted, Shay will not attack him but rather someone 10 feet away\n-you sometimes will simply not attack when commanded to and you will have to mash X until he does something\n-the game can't tell whether you want to step off a box or jump off a building\n-EXTREMELY sticky parkour\n-actions are horribly unresponsive!\nHere are other reasons why I'm disappointed:\n-the enemies are incredibly stupid\n-the camera is ridiculously bad, i.e. the camera will not follow you properly during combat and especially during a contextual finisher\n-animations are somtimes glitched during cinematics (\nthe cinematic played with me not being present, then I suddenly desynchronized and fell on the ground dead)\nI do not understand why some people consider this to be the best game in the series. They adopted SO MUCH from Black Flag. The combat animations are identical to Black Flag's,  the graphics aren't any better than Black Flag, they literally copy and pasted the inside of the merchant store from Black Flag for christ's sake... The only way this differs from Black Flag is obviously the plot, the fact you're\n, the fact enemies can board you ship, and some weapons and minor details. The combat in AC3 is VASTLY superior. I mean, absolutely night and day compared to this. Why they didn't adopt AC3's combat system is far beyond me.\nI only recommend this game if you are a hardcore fan of the series.

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 130, "page_order": 7, "recommended": false, "date": "2015-11-27", "text": "(Voted down to highlight the negatives)\nIt's a good game when seen as the Black Flag 1.5 it essentially is. There are some gameplay details that are slightly improved/extended and a good bunch of new areas to explore. It's neither reinventing the wheel nor moving away from proven ideas and as such solid/good enough in gameplay ways.\nBut there are story/character details that are bugging me.\nThe Assassins vs Templars thing is getting old, least when done like here. Other reviewers are praising how the Templars are shown less evil, but that happens by what felt as a cheap switching of sides. The labels \"Assassins\" and \"Templars\" were basically exchanged. It's the same concept that I may have seen too many times: An \"arms\" (Precursor sites) race between both sides that ends in just another undecided semi-tie. Your present self being - like in Black Flag - an uninteresting name-, face- and voiceless Abstergo employee referred to by another character only as \"numbskull\" (and openly so - perhaps he should quit the job or submit a complaint about bullying?) roaming the same Abstergo Entertainment offices as you did in Black Flag, albeit less crowded, to relive/play through the life of an Assassin/Templar that is never mentioned elsewhere and brings no conclusion to anything (there is a small tie-in to Unity, but it doesn't look like there was much to it) hardens the feeling that Ubisoft stalls the progression of the overarching story to keep up the facade of a reality-imitating, self-advertising and never-ending franchise.\nShay turns his coat for an event that - despite its severe impact on parts of civilian life - could be seen as a petty misunderstanding. \"Dude, just talk to them again, don't be so hasty!\" one might want to tell him. It feels forced. More so by how the Assassins, least those Shay is opposing, are now supposed to be reckless mass-murderers who suddenly don't care as much about their buddies or civilians and who are now sharing some of the same silly speeches upon facing death as your clich\u00e9 Templar baddies. (\"Hah, we tricked you all along you fool! But since I got nothing better to do while dying in this puddle of blood before you I'll just give you a hint towards our super-secret plan to rule/free the world regardless only so you can foil it! And while we're at it: Please take this Precursor artifact as well, I won't need it anymore, dead as I'm soon going to be!).\nIt even feels like a kind of insult that the Assassins you fight - some important figures from previous games - seem to be lacking their own skills. They are sometimes prancing about small areas of objectives literally waiting for you to air-assassinate them only with nameless grunts/thugs as meatshields. (Apparently trying to stay \"under the radar\" has become irrelevant to the Assassins, a bunch of people that can only be called  common gangs put a variant of their signature symbol all over places and are bullying and terrorizing civilians on their behalf). You can kill them as easily as any stupid Templars. They hardly feel different, and it's just as hard to actually regret what you are doing. They are depicted as sort-of-madmen throughout many parts. (They lack the evil voices and cold-blooded slaughtering of disobedient minions, but they aren't far from it). Shay is often voicing doubts about his actions against either faction (if he isn't pronouncing cockily for like the twentieth time that he \"makes his own luck\"), and his voice actor is doing rather good, but it won't help the overall feeling that things are forced and shallow. The intention must've been to blur the lines between both factions but despite probably best intentions it's done in an unimpressive, predictable, boring manner.\nShay has no great motivations. Proper reasoning has never been the strength of the series but it falls flatter here than ever. He feels very non-descriptive, siding with whoever would help him best in his vague concept of saving civilian life. And as luck would have the Templars are there when he just bailed the Assassins and got away against all odds - how convenient. He has lost no family (Ezio, Connor), he wasn't genuinely wronged by anyone (Alta\u00efr), he has no social injustice to deal with (Aveline, Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9), there is no one for him to swear true revenge to. What he cares for aside from all the factions bickering is hardly given any exposition and if it weren't for rather lucky or unlucky circumstances no one necessarily intended to have happen he might have never joined any faction to begin with. At one point he compares the lustful ladies of different places but that kind of character trait was already served with young Ezio and Edward Kenway. Even the latter with his fits of greed and wishes for an \"easy\" and \"good\" life he would want to \"taste\" was more tangible and sympathetic than what the rather cold and blank Shay can muster. Him switching sides happens rather quickly, you don't get warm with his friends/co-Assassins either, and a minute after having met them you pretty much know you are going to fight them so why even bother?\nSomething schizophrenic: You can kill civilians without desynchronization. Fans of the series might have secretly wished for that in years. But it's highly anticlimactic considering Shay betrays the Assassins only so he can save civilians instead of mass-murdering them. Even if you cast that faulty logic aside: It's not much fun killing civilians anyway because bounty hunters will be \"sent\" after you almost immediately (they spawn close to you out of thin air once your \"wanted\" level hits stage one - after three civilian kills - and they instantly jump you) who annoyingly block/parry a great part of your attacks in an otherwise highly unchallenging and massively forgiving game. A lack of difficulty isn't something bad per-se, I play the series mainly for story/characters/exploration, but such ways of artificial difficulty spikes aren't exciting to deal with when done so bluntly and a real bummer when meant to throttle down on a new feature before it had even a chance to prove itself. But I guess there had to be strict limits to this or else age ratings might have shot up a level.\nWhat genuinely disappoints/annoys me is that the present-time story is absolutely not progressing. Some dubious Abstergo superior is trying to tell you your work is oh-so-important and stuff, acting and talking to you in irritatingly vague and mysterious ways spurting hollow and meaningless phrases (\"You will understand soon\", \"Be prepared for the coming time\" etc. - I had to roll my eyes whenever I heard such lines, I'd consider quitting such a seemingly trivial job if people started talking like that to me). I believe the present-time story is one of the more interesting aspects about the series as it holds more potential and freedom in writing than the past-time scenarios that are necessarily forced to roughly follow historic facts and to avoid time paradoxi (balance of power) making even the best of them predictable in ways. But I guess the present-time story cannot be progressed as much without leading the entire series to an end, so as long as Ubisoft won't be willing to do that it will not advance at all or only at a snail's pace.

Many people, myself included, have noted that the Assassin's Creed series has been loosing it's way for some time now, what with the continuing focus on pimping historical figures and the general weakening of the stealth focus, to the point that Black Flag was only fun while on the ship and not while being an assassin, but trust me that this game brings the stealthy-stabby fun back into the fore.\nFirstly, though, do note that the game starts off poorly, the first few hours being a dull, colour-by-numbers entry into the series filled with boring wooden characters and a plot that can't really be taken seriously. Then, without wishing to spoil anything, you do something and something big happens, and at that point the game throws of its shackles and springs into glorious incandescence as it outshines anything the series has done for years by this point. Indeed, after  the first few dull missions, followed by the big event and it's follow up, I remember thinking to myself, \"Now what right does this game have to suddenly rock?\"\nAfter the big change, though, suddenly you're playing the stealthiest Assassin's Creed game ever, having to actually put forth planning to sneak about and get to your target without notice, and the game goes ****ing electric the moment the counter-assassination spy-vs-spy mechanic kicks in. On the whole, this is probably the best the series has been since II, and it outright eclipses that game in many ways.\nThat said, it's not perfect. It's a bit buggy at times (to the point that I almost failled a mission because a guy clipped into my ship, although he died anyways so no biggy) and the game seems to have been built mostly out of recycled resources. As well, for all the awesomeness of it and the greatness of it's story after the Big Thing, its story is still rather short, at least ten hours shorter than it should have been, especially considdering the sheer size of its map (the entire sandbox being larger than some of the past games combined).\nI have a theory about this game. My theory is that this is actually the game the dev's wanted to make after Black Flag, that they put forth all this effort into putting together new mechanics and the deepest story the series has had ever, that they started making the game intending it to be the next great entry in the series as a glorious return to form, and then a corporate higher-up walked in when they were half-way done and dragged most of the team away to create Unity (poor choice), leaving the remaining team to try and piece this game together.\nIn summation: it's my favorite AC game, but it could have been better.", "hours": 22.7, "user_id": "76561198050935191", "username": "NathanielRyanJones", "products": 301, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Ubisoft is leaving pc users in the dust.\nLike the other Assassin creed games, there are times when it can get very frustrating. You often will just want to kill people instead of being stealthy. You have to go after your friends who you betrayed, but catching them is so ridiculous and difficult that you actually want to kill them. They run through groups of guards who can outrun you and stop you, and they drop poison gas bombs and randomly turn around to shoot you, which cant be dodged. And if you are out of bullets you are screwed. I will often have to restart a chase because I ran into something like a chair  and tables which you can't climb over. Sometimes when you are climbing to get away the climbing system screws up and you suddenly cant grab something you clearly should. As Im typing this Im waiting for the 30 min long credits that you cant skip. This is also kinda like AC4.", "hours": 38.9, "user_id": "76561197992329702", "username": "Doctor Who Says Ni", "products": 74, "early_access": false}

I remember seeing the March release date for PC, but I forgot about it. I went to get Syndicate the other day based on a friend recommendation (AC was my favoite franchise, until Unity ruined everything, lore-wise. So no pre-ordering anymore), and saw a 11/19 release. Well, I needed my AC fix I was set on.\nAfter scrolling through a couple reviews and seeing the 'very positive' rating, I went ahead and purchased it, full price. I could not have been more surprised and pleased.\nThey took the good things from Black Flag, and spun the story around. It was incredibly refreshing! The redundancy of the Assassin's actual creed, missions, and beliefs were starting to get to me. Their story was always told with the Templars being the ultimate evil, while hinting that what the Assassin's were doing wasn't much better.\nIf you're an AC lore junkie like me, you will be very fulfilled with Rogue. Lots of goodies just like Black Flag. It's not without some terrible controls and parkour \"stickiness,\" but they are minimal and you learn to cope. The ship battles are improved, and the world is as big, if not bigger than Black Flag! Lots of side areas and places to go.\nThe ONLY downside is I feel the main story is incredibly short. A couple more sequences would have been nice.\nSome might complain about the gfx, but it's obviously a last-gen console port. On highest setting it is still immersive and good looking.

It runs off AC4's engine and reuses most of the same assets. It's a very overlooked and underrated game that was overshadowed by it's inferior brother Assassin's Creed Unity. The game serves as a prequel to Assassin's Creed 3 and a sequel to Black Flag, with character appearances from both games.\nIn Assassin's Creed Rogue you play as Shay Cormac. An Assassin who becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood and joins the Templars. The storytelling in AC: Rogue is the biggest thing the game does well. The Templars in AC: Rogue are portrayed as stalward defenders of peace and order, wheras the Assassin's are well intentioned extremists who want freedom by any means necessary. This game actually started to make me view the actions you undertook in previous games in a completely different light. The Assassin's are portrayed largely as criminals who Shay tasks himself with destroying. It feels like a much more politically Conservative game as a result. You're not a revolutionary overthrowing a despot. You play as a man who wants to protect the things he cares about. This all feels very fresh and makes the game stand out to me compared to other games in the series. It's also one of the few games in the series where the protagonist's default outfit lacks a hood.\nIn terms of gameplay it fundamentally is the same as Black Flag. With a few changes here and there. They replaced Assassination missions with Interception missions, where you prevent assassinations. They also introduced enemies called Stalkers. Who hide in areas like haystacks and bushes similar to the player and abush you. Using similar tactics that you have employed in previous games. You also explore rivers and valleys in the Northern Atlantic as opposed to an ocean in the Carribean, so the game does have a different aesthetic style.\nNow while I do like Rogue and do recommend the game, it's not perfect. The game is shorter than both Black Flag and AC3. And while I did enjoy the storyline it took a lot of time to really get interesting once you became a templar. The general gameplay also felt far too much like a stand-alone expansion pack to Black Flag. It feels too stuck in Black Flag's shadow and it's probably the biggest reason I cannot recommend this game at full price. If you didn't like AC4 then you also will not like this game either because of how similar it is.\nThe best thing I can really say about Rogue is it did what it set out to do very well.

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 135, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-10-12", "text": ": Ubisoft Sofia, Ubisoft Kiev\n: Ubisoft\n==========\nAssassin's Creed Rogue was horribly overshadowed by Unity. They were both released close together, yet Unity got all the attention, despite how horrible unoptimized and downright unplayable it was for a time. But forget Unity. Assassin's Creed Rogue is where it's at. Taking on the role of Shay Cormac, a cocky, headstrong fledgling Assassin trained by the Assassin Brotherhood of Achilles, you are taken on one hell of a journey that brings to light what the Assassins have in store for the world. In light of certain events, Shay decides to turn his back on his Brothers, betrays them, and then joins the Templars. Using the skills he learned under Assassin tutelage, Shay is now an Assassin Hunter. Taking place in 18th century North America, Assassin's Creed Rogue is the first game in the acclaimed series where you play as a member of the opposing faction: the Templars.\n==========\nWe all know how Assassin's Creed plays. The series has been around for many years now. You are an employee at Abstergo Industries, using a device called the Animus to explore the memories of different figures from the past. In this installment, you dive into the memories of Assassin Shay Cormac. The main draw of Rogue is the story, the turns it takes, and the likeable and downright badass main character, but it uses many of the familiar mechanics and control schemes of previous titles. A lot of the mechanics and features from Black Flag return for Rogue, including sailing your own ship and upgrading it. Though there isn't nearly as much of the ship element involved as there was in Black Flag, it's been refined and is much more enjoyable. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" is the saying that comes to mind.\nAssassin skills only carry Shay so far, and for everything else he depends on the various tools at his disposal. In addition to the basic tools of the trade (such as the Hidden Blades), the pistol set, the dagger/sword set, and Eagle Vision, Shay also has access to a number of other tools to aid him in his journey. As you progress the story you will slowly unlock these tools. The first of which is an Air Rifle. Naturally silent, the sleek Air Rifle fires 3 types of darts: Sleep, Berserk, and Firecracker. Sleep darts put the target to sleep, berserk darts cause their target to enter a state of uncontrollable rage, attacking anything nearby, and firecracker darts are used to create lures or distractions. Along with the air rifle, you also have a prototype grenade launcher. A smaller version of what we are used to from other game, this grenade launcher has 3 different grednades: Sleep, Berserk, and Shrapnel. Sleep and Berserk grenades work the same way their dart counterparts do, exact in a small are of effect. Shrapnel grenades are essentially small bombs that take down targets in their radius. Another smaller tool is the Rope Dart, which can be used to grapple and drag targets around, or outright hang them.\nA new mechanic introduced by Rogue are the Stalkers. These are NPC assassins that hide everywhere and are out to kill Shay. These are introduced after a certain part of the story, and easily the mosty annoying feature of the game. They will jump from on top of buildings on top of you as you are going to your next objective and backstab you, oftentimes killing you before you even know what's going on. Luckily, the game provides you a sort of compass to find them before they find you in Eagle Vision. You also know when you get close to one when you hear whispering.\nCollectibles make a return from previous installments, and there are a TON: Animus Fragments, Templar Maps, Prosperity Gems, Shanties, and Chests are scattered around every location. Half the fun of the game is finding all of these collectibles. Some of them, such as the Prosperity Gems, will benefit you in some way, by increasing your income from various sources. Templar Maps points you to hidden treasures at certain, very specific locations. Shanties unlock new songs for your ship's crew to sing while traveling on the sea. Some chests contain Blueprints, which are basically your ultimate ship upgrades. Crafting makes a return, using items you skin or gather from animals you hunt. Also outfits.\nSome new mechanics you will also find are Renovations and Gang HQs/Economic Centers. Renovations are buildings scattered about that can be rebuilt using resources you find, such as stone, cloth, and wood. Gang HQs and Economic Centers are small strongholds that can be taken over to provide you permanent income and act as Fast Travel points. These Economic Center and Renovations both provide income, which can be collected from the Bank in your Captain's Quarters on your ship, or at Banks in each Economic Center. All of these are worth investing in, as soon you will have more money that you'll know what to do with.\n==========\nRogue looks just as good as Black Flag. Absolutely stunning. All the little details really stand out, such as facial hair. It looks very realistic. Assassin's Creed has always been one of the leaders in video game graphics, alongside other companies like Square-Enix, and it shows in Rogue. The UI seems a bit more cleaned up than in previous titles, and the map is very clear and expansive.\nSome of the best looking moments are when you are sailing the high seas. Whether in the frozen northern areas or the warmer climates, the water looks absolutely stunning. Your ship also behaves on the waves as real ships do. It's this attention to these small details that really set things apart from others.\n==========\nThe soundtrack is rather good. The main theme of Rogue, featured on the title screen and in a very few cutscenes, has some amazing yet haunting vocals, and some other influences.\nSound effects are great. Gunshots sound authentic, and sound true to 18th century weaponry. Sword clashes are awesome, as well as cannonfire from your ship. Nothing is really out of place, and sound great.\n==========\nI had no issues whatsoever with Rogue. 60 FPS at all times, no lag or stuttering. PC Specs on my profile. The game didn't crash, ever, and while it does require Uplay, I barely noticed it at all. Once I activated the game on Uplay, the only time I ever saw it even existed was for a few brief seconds as the game launched.\nI highly recommend playing with a controller. The mouse/keyboard controls work, and are alright to use, but I feel a controller is the way to go. The game just feels better this way. The default control scheme was perfect. I didn't have to make any changes at all, as the defaults were comfortable and easy to remember.\n==========\nAssassin's Creed Rogue is probably the best game in the series thus far. Offering a viewpoint from the Templars on the opposing side of the war, it shows us a great story viewed through the eyes of a very likeable character. Fun new weapons/tools, improved ship handling and mechanics, coupled with tons of things to do and collect make Rogue a great addition to your Steam (and Uplay) library.

It NEVER crashed, NEVER stuttered, NEVER glitched and NEVER dropped frames. I actually believe that it is the most solid and technically sound game in the franchise at this point. It appears to be built upon the same engine as Black Flag, but unlike BF it never felt like it was ready to break apart at any second. It is incredibly refined and looks great.\nI am a sucker for stories like this but I was hooked immediatly. It isn't exposition driven and as a result you come to share an empathy with Shay as events unfold. You see things from his point of view (In this case from the side of the templars) and it makes him very relatable as his actions seem JUSTIFIED. I dig it. ;)\nIf I had to pick a fault with the game, it would be that with the franchise itself. Simply put AC games are getting HUGE in terms of the game world and to prolong the experience; devs are craming in as many collectables as possible. I understand the reasons behind it (open world, forces exploration ect...) but it is just at the point where it has NOTHING to do with the story and is simply distracting. It is beyond filler content and if they could tone it down somewhat or give me a reason to 100% everything, I feel Ubisoft should go for it!\nDo I reccommend this game? Yes. A huge resounding yes.

They really should've focused on this instead of Unity and added a hell of a lot more to the game, but hey, it's kept me occupied for almost 70 hours trying to 100% it (Howwever, many of those hours may have been me in the pause menu doing somerthing else as the in-game statistics say I've spent about 38 hours. I don't know way really. Anyway, it's good). Anyway, to the review.\nGameplay: Almost identical to Black Flag except instead of being in the Caribbean you're in the North Atlantic and some place, I believe in Canada, known as River Valley. You're also are allowed to revisit New York from AC3 only it is a hell of alot more attractive and somewhat larger. This game is essentially AC3 and 4's love child. Some new features include being hunted by Assassins and being able to turn the hunter into the hunted by taking out the Assassins. You can also be borded yourself now by enemies, and you will be forced to defend your ship. They've also brought ziplines back, I don't remember if they were in AC4. There's also gases now which you can counter the effects of by equipping a gas mask (basically a bandana). There are some bugs, check the cons section for more info. Also, free running can be a bit of a pain like previous AC games.\nGraphics: The graphics are a bit dated but they are better than 3's and either a little worse than 4's or as good as 4's. There are also quite a few graphical options to tinker with. New animations seem a little clunky though, and a lot of animations are recycled from previous games. The game performs a lot more smoothly than Unity.\nPlot and protagonist (or I suppose in this case Anti-villian): This is seriously the most satisftying plot I have ever encountered in an AC4 game. The ending - my god the ending - is so damn awesome. The only problem is the story is very short - only six sequences, and if I recall correctly, sequence 5 is only 2 missions. D': Anyway, you are Shay Patrick Cormac (oh, and some unnamned guy/gal in the modern day), an Assassin turned Templar after he begins to doubt the Assassin order (or is it just Achilles brotherhood?) and their intentions. That's pretty much as far into the plot as I'm going to go in this review, however. Character's previously seen in the series include: Benjamin Franklin, George Washington (shortly), Achilles Davenport, Adewal\u00e9 and Haytham Kenway. Most new character's are quite interesting even though they aren't on screen very long as the story is short. Shay is a fresh character, although a bit too selfless and doesn't seem to care much for himself (or perhaps his goals only seem selfless? Personally, I think his character was just made far too selfless) and he seems to have an obsession for the phrase, \"I make my own luck!\".  Just in case anyone's wondering where he came from, he came from Ireland, so I suppose this may explain his obsession with luck! (PLEASE DON'T HATE ME, THAT WAS A JOKE! D':)\nMusic, sound effects and voice acting: Shanties are back! Weigh-hay and up she rises, Weigh-hay and up she rises, Weigh-hay and up she rises... right, yeah, sorry... Got a bit distracted there... Anyway, the music is mostly either recycled or a slightly altered version of a previous song from a previous games soundtrack. Still it's good quality and sounds good. The sounds are again mostly recycled but are good quality. The voice acting is for the most part quite good. Gist's american accent sounds far too exaggerated though (if that's the voice actors real voice... Well it's just so stereotypical!) and whenever you finish hunting any natuical creatures - whales, sharks, etc. - the crew yelling \"Yeah, All right!\" sounds really outdated and is awful quality. Other than that, it's pretty good.\nTo sum it up:\nPros:\nFamiliar gameplay with new elements.\nFresh, satisfying and interesting plot and protagonist.\nLot's to do.\nPlay's smoothly.\nA good comeback for the AC series, if only it was a main game that was focused on more.\nYou're playing as a Templar! That's good in my book! I love 'em more than Assassin's! Sorry! In all seriousness, that offers another side to the story.\nCons:\nQuite an awful lot of recycling, but it is in a big series of games that have been going for quite a while, so it's expected\nWould like a few more new gameplay elements.\nSome, but very little, voice acting is shockingly bad, or at least of bad quality (Only really one line though, although it's repeated a fair bit).\nShort story.\nAlmost a signature of the Assassin's Creed series; free-running can be a pain.\nSome bugs... I got stuck inside my god damn ship and died in the freezing Atlantic Ocean... Twice! Also, I once encountered floating weaponry fighting one of my crew members when bording a ship. By that, I mean, an enemy model was invisible.\nSome new animations are clunky looking.\nVerdict:\n8.5/10\nA real fresh comeback for the AC series which is actually fun and mostly plays well. Fun, character, fun gameplay, fun story. If you're a die hard AC fan - and if you like Templars more than Assassins (like me!)...

Something about the storyline for Black Flag was inspiring and very immersive for me, Rogue kind of cuts straight to the chase but with a somewhat equally inspiring storyline and the fact you get to play as a bit more of a solid bad guy than the other episodes is cool too.

It added many new weapons from its predecessor (Black Flag), though the only one which was actually really *new* was the grenades, and added an admittedly interesting gas mechanic to the game. It also was much more filled and felt significantly less grindy than Black Flag; these were all great improvements to the series from the previous title, but unfortunately, these are the only positive things I can say about this game. What this game made up for in being playable, it lost in a dissapointing lack of charm.\n**The remainder of this review contains massive spoilers, referrencing the end of the game**\nEither due to false marketing on the community's behalf or on Ubisoft, we're lead to believe that the main character, Shay, is the victim of a massive betrayal and seeks revenge against the brotherhood. This story sounded interesting, and for many of us, it was the first time we'd see the story from a Templar's point of view. Or at least, that's what I expected, but not what I recieved. Shay was never the victim of a betrayal, but rather the victim of a mistake in which no one was guilty. Rather than confront his Mentor about what he witnessed, which would be the logical thing to do, Shay gets unrealistically emotional about the situation and blames everything on his Mentor. He then consciously decides to betray his brotherhood, and is retaliated against accordingly.\nWhat follows isn't a story of revenge against the backstabbing brotherhood, but rather a convoluted scheme to stop a man who ends up listening to his own conscience in the end anyways, rendering Shay's entire mission completely pointless. He decides, for no other reason than one of the British officers was nice to him while he was injured, to help his hated rivals, the Templars, and eventually join their Order and assist the British in winning the Seven Years War.\nMy biggest complain about this game is that under no point of this game do you ever see the positives in joining the Templar Order. The Templars were never painted as the good guys, rather the game regularly reminds you that they are the bad guys, and the reasons for Shay's complete dedication toward the Order seems to entirely ignore his high moral stance which directed him to betray the Assassins. There never seems to be a point, other than the rosey tone of a single man who dies before Shay even makes the decision to join the Templars, where I (the player) feel like I should actually want to be a Templar.\nAs if the feeling of \"why on Earth am I killing the good guys?\" wasn't enough to make the game feel horrible, the ending seals this game as completely unnecessary and makes no sense. I'm not referring to the mission in Versailles (though the mission itself feels like an unnecessary and shoe-horned-in shameless advertisement for Unity), but rather the Naval Missions. I was quite confused while trying to complete the Naval Missions (which must be completed if you are to unlock much of the best stuff in the game) in that they no longer let you complete them until you \"progress further into the story.\" This was right before the last mission of the game.\nIn case that wasn't clear, let me restate this: The final 5 Naval Missions, which are required for completion and for unlocking some of the best gear in the game, doesn't get unlocked until you've COMPLETED the game. Why? Were the developers afriad that I'd be cheating with Alt\u00efar's Swords on a mission which doesn't even let you use anything other than your Hidden Blades? Why was this required? So that people would be forced to play hours more of the game after they already completed the story? Who thought this was a good idea??\nOverall, I think the game is fine. I never felt like I was doing the right thing, but so what? Plenty of games let you play as the bad guy (though they usually leave out the high sense of morality that constantly reminds you that what you did was morally sketchy and highlights that you're actually the bad guy in this game). The Naval Missions is a cheap and pathetic move on the fault of the developers, but hey, **at least the game plays on PC, Montreal!!**. But would I recommend it, though? No. It doesn't add much from Black Flag, and unlike this game, Black Flag had characters I actually could **care** about. I couldn't have cared less if the characters died; the fact that two of them were Haythem Kenway and Achilles Davenport defeated the possibility of that happening anyways. Comparing that to Black Flag, or more accurately Black Beard, it was geniunely disastrous watching Edward Thatch die. We had actually come to care about him and his death was genuinely devastating. In AC: Rogue, however, none of the characters invoke that amount of compassion. None of the characters seemed to have any real life. When they died, it was difficult to really think anything of it.\nThis game is fine, but you'd be better off playing Black Flag.", "hours": 48.8, "user_id": "76561198133060959", "username": "Couillon", "products": 78, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 143, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-07-13", "text": "I've played all of the Assassin's Creed games and I have to say, this is the best Assassin's Creed game I've played since Brotherhood, but I cannot deny that this game is VERY buggy and was, no doubt, rushed (It is made by Ubisoft after all).\nThe parkour system in this game is, by far, the worst it's ever been, it has the same basis as Black Flag but the terrain was not polished at all. There are alot of places that look climbable but they're actually not, they are found mainly in the islands. While they are not that common in big towns, like Albany, New York, etc.. You will be spending most of your time on the islands and not in the main cities. You can see how bad the parkour system is when you have to chase someone, or something, like a shanty for example. Having said that, I don't really care for parkour in AC games, that's why it's not a big deal for me.\nThe combat is pretty much the same thing as it was in Black Flag, even though Shay has a new type of weapon (sword and dagger) it's basically the same thing with one or two new animations slapped on so you can't say it's just a reskin. Shay has reduced health and can't take many hits even with max upgrades, which makes Blazing your way through a fortress filled with snippers, dozens of armed men,grenadiers and captains slightly harder... It is still very possible and easy to do so though.\nThe naval battles have changed a bit, for example, heavy shot and mortars in Black Flag used to be all you needed to win, atleast that's how I did it. Here... Not so much, those weapons are pretty much just as effective as the rest of them.\nThe explosive barrels (Not sure what they were called in English, I only know their name in my language) have been replaced with fire...Fire... On the sea, it is not explained why you can leave a blazing trail of glorious fire on the sea.\nRegardless, it's just as useless as it was in Black Flag... I think they tried to make the combat a bit more challenging, because I did notice the enemies became a tad stronger and more resistant to my attacks, I've only seem that in the lesser ships though, e.g: schooners to brigs, beyond that they are really easy to take down, in fact the Men 'o War are ridiculously easy to destroy and board, hell, even the legendary ships were a walk in the park. Having said that, I think they were just as fun, epic and awesome as the previous game.\nStealth mechanics are the same as Black Flag, but enemies sometimes do have x-ray vision and can spot you through a wall a mile away, snipers will sometimes shoot you through the wall... That's all I have to talk about for stealth.\nNew mechanics: Most of what I'm about to tell you is not explained in the game, you have to go to the tutorial section and look for them there.\nThere's a new elevator system, basically it's 3 walls made of wood where Shay will just wall jump his way to the top in the worst animated way ever, there is also  2 hooks connected through a wire between rooftops so you can do basically what you did in revelations to go around slightly faster, just so you can't complain that the cities are too sparse, you can sometimes swing from a rope to another building like you used to do on your boat. You can renovate buildings that are spread around the map, that increases your income, when you renovate all of them you get an achievement, an abstergo challenge and a ugly sword with good stats. When you renovate the buildings you'll most of the times not even see the difference, it will look just as run down as before, there is also a thing called prosperity rewards, it means when you collect five of them you get a boost to goods you salvage of boarded ships and to your income which brings me to the final new mechanic: Income. Every 20 minutes you get an X ammount of money depending how much prosperity,buildings you renovated and settlements/areas you've freed. At first it's a miserable ammount, but by the end you'll be swimming in money.\nYou also have your fleet which you can capture ships and send them there so they can complete missions and earn you rewards, like money,figureheads,sails,collectibles,wheel,swords,pistols,and,outfits. At first the missions will be really short, like 10 minutes or so to complete a mission, but in the later levels, like 20 and up it will take you nearly 2 hours JUST to complete one mission, this is specially bad when you've got nothing to do and you're just waiting for the timer to tick down. This is just an excuse that Ubisoft got to make the game seems longer than what it actually is. Which brings me to my next point: Game length.This game is VERY short. I have completed EVERYTHING to do in the North Atlantic, completed the main story, did all the side quests collected 62 abstergo challenges, collected every costume but two, got all the upgrades for both Shay and the Morrigan, got every sword but two, collected all the pistol sets,took down every gang HQ, every settlement, every fort, discovered every location,got all the templar maps,completed all assassin interceptions,all legendary ships, almost every hunting challenge. renovated almost every building and completed every single naval mission and I've only played 28.6 hours. It would be even shorter if Ubisoft didn't make you collect a ridiculous ammount of stuff just to unlock an outfit or whatever.\nThis game is a very good port. When I try to run Black Flag I get about 40fps at 768p on medium, but here I can turn it up to ultra on 768p and I play at a constant 60fps and the games have the same spec requirements, sometimes, when you're in a very intense situation with alot of ships, smoke everywhere, everyone firing, it can dip to 40fps-ish. But other than that, you're fine\nIn conclusion, this game is very fun and addicting, there were times where I would be up until 6 a.m playing this game. If you're a person that enjoys these games for the parkour, jumping around and climbing everything like a monkey or you just cannot tolerate glitches that break immersion on your game then this game is not for you. However if you're looking for a fun pirate game, with some awesome combat mechanics and don't mind having your character flip out, jump into the clouds or killing someone and they looking like ragdolls flying everywhere then this game is for you", "hours": 44.2, "username": "Alexandre", "products": 269, "early_access": false}

I make my own luck.\"\nAssassin's Creed Rogue; The 7th main game in the series (Well main console game in the series. following the events of AC Black Flag, acting as a prequel to the events of Assassin's Creed III. In the first of two recent games in this mighty franchise, we follow the accounts of Shay Cormac, an aspiring, moral-yet-crass Assassin whose only wish is to make the world a better place. From the get-go, we feel a bit of a connection with Shay, but at the same time, you don't really get that strong of a connection until a bit later. After a string of successful missions, Shay learns of an artifact that has been the focus of all the games: The Apple of Eden. Upon learning of its true power, he begins to wonder if what he's doing is the right thing. When things unfold, he is betrayed by those he once called brothers, and is picked up by the Templars and eventually becomes one of them. With a new mission and a new outlook, he hunts down the Brotherhood to prevent them from destroying the world.\nI won't spoil more than that, cause that's pretty much the box text, but now to the review itself....I loved this game. It is fantastic. It is definitely a shorter game than its predecessors, but to pack as much as they did in 15-20 hours and still make it compelling? Brilliantly done. This game...was more intense than the majority of the games. In terms of that intensity, I think it rivals that of the Ezio trilogy. Specifically Revelationss. You can feel the deep-seeded hatred and regret that Shay feels for the Brotherhood. He bled for them, and he was willing to die for them...only to have it thrown in his face...I held my breath more times than any other AC game thus far. If you're a fan, I definitely recommend it. I have nothing else to say other than you need to play it. You feel for Shay even if he logic isn't entirely sound at points. The only negative thing about it?...ummm....the combat was a bit choppy when fighting on ship decks and it made chain kills a bit difficult. Aside from that, well done, Ubisoft.

AC Games haven't had the best reputation on pc after AC IV: Black Flag and AC Unity. But I can for safely say that this game is very solid.\nI got this game on the steam summersale with the Unity-Rogue bundle and I am not dissapointed.\nPROS\n- In the terms of graphics this game is no stunner. Almost similar to AC IV: Black Flag with a few improvements. Then again it's surely not an ugly game either.\n- The setting is great, sailing in frosty seas, and the game really does a good job giving you that feel.\n- Even out of the Animus, there is lots of interesting things to find, as you repair computers and find notes. Much more interesting than in AC IV: Black Flag. Some things could for examble be a video with a interesting take on a charrecter we have interacted with or seen in other games!\n- Even though this game seem alot like AC IV: Black Flag and surtainly plays alot like it. They have managed to create a new game out of old stuff.\nCONS\n- The story is short. I completed this game in around 14-15 hours, with me slagging a bit. (Doing side objectives and so on) There is still more I can do and explore, but as for the main story it falls a bit short.\n- Price: For as good and solid game this is. It is not worth 50\u20ac. Especially if you have played both AC III and AC IV: Black Flag. Not to mention it's short story compared to the price, and many of the sideobjectives are nearly identical to the ones in AC IV: Black Flag, just with a little twist.\n- Bugs... Ah yes, what is an AC game without it's bugs? I have played them all, and I have found a bug in each one of them. It being console or pc they are still there and this game is not free of them either allthough very minor. The bugs I incountered: Assassinated a npc in a bush and your charrecter froze completely and couldn't move, where I had to restart the game. / Stuck on loading screen. / Unable to block even though I clearly pressed the button in time.\n- As a one last con... Uplay.... This game requires a 3rd-party DRM (As all ubisoft games do on steam.) and I can tell you that it just doesn't work. Crashing, half of the features not working, and very clunky to use. Especially because it doesn't work well with steam. So if you buy this game (Or any game from ubisoft) do be aware that.\nCONCLUSION\nAll in all this is a good game with a heavy pricetag on it for what it is. Basicly an AC: IV: Black Flag game in AC III settings, with you playing as a templar. If you can get this game on a sale, it's definetly a win!

About how while I applaude them making the parkour much better, especially for PC, it's performance is terrible and requires a rig that only the tiny minority will actually have. Plus it isn't that good of a story to begin with.\nThis game is different though. It's treated as a side story. Something that is unimportant to the main storyline, something more for the diehard Assassins Creed fans, or at least the ones that didn't want to buy a new console. But the story is really good, much better than it's Unity brother. The main character's story is much more interesting. Seeing the Templar side of the story made me actually sit back and question the overall question that Assassins Creed as a whole asks. \"Is it better to have peace through freedom or through control?\"\nBefore playing this game I was firm in thinking that the Templars are wrong and that they are bad and evil. But then I played this game to see the otherside of the fense. While the thought of giving up freedom is something that we as humans fundimentally are against, the cost of having said freedom often leads to outcomes that aren't necessarily for the benefit of everyone as a whole. I often questioned whether or not the Templars maybe be in the right. Afterall we all willingly give up some freedoms that we as humas can do with laws. We give up physical freedoms with rules that we have implimented for the benefit of us all.\nOf course what's most important is the gameplay, not the philosophical aspects of it. Basically saying, if you liked Assassins Creed IV's gameplay, you're going to enjoy this game greatly. Sea chanties, slowly pased options to finish levels without alerting anyone, AI that isn't terrible in comparison to Unity. It has everything to love. Although I do have to say the whole Abstergo Entertainment portions of the game are the weakest parts again. It's cool if you're into the lore of the Assassins Creed universe, for most it's just a waste of time.\nSo all in all is this game worth buying? Well that's up to you. Unfortunately it does follow the curse of the yearly franchise. Not much changes but it's still a good game. If you've not played Black Flag definitely play this game. It's got the best story tie ins in all of the Assassins Creed games, intertwining with Assassins Creed 3, 4, and Unity in a VERY fantastic way.", "hours": 11.5, "username": "NakedSpaceMan", "products": 545, "early_access": false}

That said you don't have to had play 3, but you'll recognize some things and people. Furthermore, this game connects details and facts from AC3, AC4, and AC Unity, its incredible.\nStory (8.5/10) - One of the best all around naratives in AC for a while no. Believe what the description says about dark, turning back on your friends then hunting them down leaves a bit of your soul feeling dirty. Overall, it creates a wonderfully mature narative that many will enjoy.\nGameplay (7/10) - Give it a 7 here just because its still the same all AC that we saw from 4, just with more content. Cormack is given some new weapons and tactics but nothing revolutionary. Same old AC gameplay here, but fun none the less. (Less Buggy Feeling)\nReplayability (Medium) - Ok, so I love games that let you keep going on after the story itself is over (like GTA5 and Fallout 3 w/ DLC), but a lot of things that you can do just don't seem to have a point to them. However, if you are a completionists, there is absolutely an unfathomable amount of content here.\nIn total, I highly recommend this game to anyone who may have overlooked this game due to Unity, and past fans of the series, as well as new that may have some background knowledge of the game.

I got it because Unity is too broken to play based on other peoples reviews. So when the sale was going around, aka summer sale, I got it. Since I never played Unity I can't say how the gameplay is or story. So I'll talk about how I feel about this game.\nThe gameplay is very similiar to AC4. Gameplay being for me atmosphere of the game. You're on a ship sometimes and land other times. You gonna go from one place to the other a lot. The map of where you can go is different. You can got to 3 different locations which is pretty cool. Each location has a different evironment. You can modify your ship again with armor and bascially the same stuff as AC4.\nNote: I have seen a lot of bugs in this game. Like the character disapearing in cutscenes. A simple reload always does the trick. But it is annoying.\nThe story is kind of boring. The whole point of this is to see the main character (Shay) go from Assassin to Templar and thats all I was waiting for. And going along with that, since I just wanted to see that I didn't really care about his (Shay) early assassin missions. So I finished the main story pretty quick but if I explored more I would have gotten more hours into it. One thing I did like is that some of the missions didn't feel like \"filler\" missons and if felt like an actual mission. Example being, \"Go get this item for this guy, then do something for another guy.\" The missions in this feels more like a mission. Like you're actually accomplishing something.\nThe combat is kind of fluid, it has a lot of the same moves from AC4, but the other motions that they added in are clunky. The game looks good, but again takes me back to AC4.\nI know this isn't a great review for something I recommend, but this final bit is why I do. This game wraps up the Kenway Story from AC3 and AC4. Also at the very end it has a scene from\n. It just concludes so many unclosed doors, so to speak, from these two games that left out so much. I recommend this game if you want their story to be finished and never told ever again.\nI don't think this game is as good as the others and not worth the $50. Get it when it goes on sale, I got it when it was $20.

I'm running it in 1920x1080 on a Core2Quad Q9400 @ 2.66 GHZ, 8 GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 650 1GB, and except for some of the post processing options (e.g. volumetric fog) turned off, everything is on high or normal and the game looks fantastic. Steady frame rates throughout, whether on land or at sea. A little frame drop happens after some bigger ship battles when a lot of smoke and fire have to be rendered during boarding operations, but it's still perfectly playable at that point. A slight sluggishness feeling is the best way to describe it. You could try and tweak overall performance by lowering the resolution a little and then potentially add more effects to see how far you can push it, but that's personal preference. The game looks great regardless.\nUbisoft! I was actually very pleasantly surprised.\nThe controls are all fully re-mappable as well; both on foot and for ship controls, so you can choose whatever you like at your heart's content. Considering this isn't an option at all in \"Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China\" at all, to me, that's a great plus.\nStorywise I can't really say too much just yet, I've only scratched the surface (will update this review when I know more), but so far it's fun and the scenery is actually really, really beautiful. I suppose you could just blast through the storyline, but I actually enjoy just roaming around a little, procuring some resources for crafting and generally checking out the area.\nBottom line: Whether you're an AC veteran like myself and enjoyed the entire franchise so far, or whether you're new to the Assassin's Creed games, this is one of the best installments of series, and if you want to give any game of the franchise a go without being too picky to play them in order (important plot elements from past games are explained well enough for you not to miss out all too much), I would either go with this, or with Assassin's Creed II.\nHaving played this now for some time, I can definitely say this is as much fun as Black Flag. It's a bit more of a \"civilized\" and \"tactical\" warfare than the random privateering you get in Black Flag, but it's definitely worth it. I'd probably call Black Flag \"GTA IV\" where Rogue would be \"Watch_Dogs\". Don't let that comparison frighten you though (if you don't like either or one of the comparisons). It's a great game, you can manage a fleet, resources, follow the much more on-track mission, or just free-roam for as long as you like. You definitely want to grab another hide for that pouch you always wanted. Despite the role change, Shay does grow on you, and the added possible attacks by your former brethren at any turn, definitely are a nice touch.", "hours": 28.7, "username": "jssrfx", "products": 402, "early_access": false}

I mean Unity isn't even in the same ball park. The first hour or two I spent playing this game I kept thinking to myself \"So... this is basically just an expansion for Black Flag...\" because a lot of the mechanics and assets will feel the same. HOWEVER: once you finish the first couple of sequences the game changes dramatically and you can tell they put a lot of work into the world and plot. That isn't to say the first few sequences were boring in any way; they had everything I loved about Black Flag... hopping from island to island with naval battles in between, upgrading your ship to become an unstoppable killing machine, hunting, crafting, harpooning, etc. It's all there. It's just that after the first few sequences the game is suddenly like: oh you thought that was the game? Check this out...\nI won't spoil any of the added content and mechanics as this is a review and not a Ubisoft praise-fest (I mean let's face it Ubisoft is one of the worst publishers out there when it comes to customer service and ethics).\nPROS\n-It has everything that made Black Flag so great. They took a \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" approach to the core mechanics that I wish a lot more developers would do.\n-The same interesting plot and setting that we've come to expect from Assassin's Creed games. This one is set in between Black Flag and 3, I believe.\n-Tons of collectibles that actually give you something in the game. I remember a big complaint with Black Flag was that the animus fragments didn't do anything. Now they do; kinda.\nCONS\n-That grunting whenever you jump or get hit. Not only does it not match your character's voice whatsoever... it's REALLY ANNOYING. I don't normally flip out that much about it but it's BAD and overused in this game.\n-I'll have to go back and check Black Flag and 3 but the cut scenes in this game seem really poorly animated.\n-Those AC controls. Never before have I loved a series so much and hated actually playing it so much. \"Oh you wanted to jump onto that tree branch to pick up the animus fragment? Nah you're going in the river in which you can't jump out of unless you swim 300 meters downstream so you can walk all the way back and try again. Oh you wanted to synchronize that viewpoint? No you're jumping off the roof and dying.\"\n-Only two pistols this time around? I understand not making every character the same but Jesus combat is hard enough when you're moving the camera angle all over the freaking place.\n-Nit-picking here but come on guys why can't we fast travel to our ship when it's docked? They did add more rowboats and another way to get back to your ship, I  will give them that. Just seems like a lot of extra work when all they had to do was give you the ability to fast travel.\nOh and by the way: Unless you're a completionist, skip the Assassin Interception missions.

Ive played all the other ones on console and really enjoyed their story, minus AC4 Black Flag story but still a great game. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PLAY UNITY to play this if thats what you are wondering. Read up on Unity story line if you want, but Just save some money and get this beauty of a game instead. Here's why:\nPros-\nThe naval combat from Black Flag is put right into this, which is absolutly amazing. I have spent several hours just upgrading my ship, collecting stone to renovate buildings to put into my steady income that consists of plundered ship money and property. Integrating this into the story (which I am getting to shortly since it was 10/10) was great since you weren't really a pirate but a templar/assassin with an ACTUAL recruitment intro... unlike in black flag where you pick up assasin blades and then bam: \"Hey I am pirate assasin now!\", so happy they didn't make that mistake again.  Oh yeah: and NOT A SINGLE UNDERWATER SWIMMING MINI MISSION CRAP! It's great :)\nThe property machanic is great. You get some loot into the bank over time while you are out at sea, doing the story line (again I am going to get to here shortly because holy crap is it good) doing intercepting Assasination contracts or whatever it is you feel like doing in the game.\nThe fleet missions are in it still. Send your captured ships out to do your bidding and collect valueable items and collectables. I got some awesome pistol sets and a good set of swords and daggers from these. Just send and forget as you go back to pillaging the Assasins strongholds or headquarters.\nThis story had me hooked. You play as an Assassin at first, learning and working with other known Assassins throughout the series kind of, it takes place before AC3. And then some things happen, which I cant spoil, that pretty much send your character to question the brotherhoods motives. In turn this forces an emotional decision that the character has to make and that you (as the player really) pretty much sides with. I felt very confused and distraught as he did, which makes it even better because it's a whole other side of these series that you never get to see SINCE Altiar started questioning why he was killing men who were trying to HELP, not destroy. Playing a templar assassin with virtuous ambition that fights to uphold to, that myself as a player agree with, and huge conflict within him is 10/10 storytelling in my opinion.\nYou then HUNT DOWN assassins, its a lot of fun. Intercept contracts and take out the assassins that were associated with it. Yes you can be insta-killed but other assassins hiding throughout the game if you aren't too careful, gives it a nice challenge. Throughout it you may have to leave the animus to do some things in modern time like in black flag, but its pretty cool, nothing too lame. It ties together all the other games series too.\nAlso, you can kill civilians without any drawbacks...except some annoying bounty hunters. But hey, you are a templar ;)\nThere are a lot of pro's but I can't name them all.. Imagine it like they took all the great things about the other games and threw them into this one, along with some extra goodies.\nCons:\nNONE except for one bug- taking over a fort where I needed to kill 2 snipers. They were both marked but one of them just wasn't visible, or there for that matter. It was no biggie, just jumped into some fire which reset me back into the beginning of entering the fort.\nOverall this game is a must of AC players, especially for those who havent played Unity.

When you are in the moment its great but after story it seems pretty bland, but still good.\nA good amount of content, especially if you get the DLC. Although I will say if you play this game and only this game for like 6 or so hours a day for a few weeks you will 100 percent this game (aside from optional objectives during story, that may take longer) I bought this on thursday, made this review monday and im almost done with my ship and did the story in  2 days. Its very fun with alot of replay value. Not a game you may spend hundreds+ hours on, but for sure a good buy.\nSoundtrack and art style is AMAZING. feel totally submersed. This game is great, of course with the next games i expect a step up and it will be awesome. This is what AC should be, not too much BS and a lot of fun. Very few issues. Great game\nI got the deluxe on sale, as much as i love the game it isnt worth full price.\nA few cons aside from full price is bugs, i get a good amount of bugs. Some are really funny, a few made me have to restart a level but nothing over the top. But something to note. During story when im on my boat, when there is someone on either side of me talking i have to put both ear buds in to hear them. If you play the game with one earbud in, you wont hear full dialogue.\nI do have 3 gameplay issues that i really hate, 1 is boat stealth missions. AC4 had it worse but this game still has it, it makes no sense to have a boat stealth mission. 2, i really REALLY hate the Abstergo part, were you leave the animus to fix servers and\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Takes away from the game i really hate it. Unity didnt have it i think, and unity also got alot of customization that rogue didnt. My final complaint (and maybe my biggest) is for some reason the enemy AI is incredibly high. They can detect i stabbed someone from across a map? THROUGH WALLS? they seem to know everything i do and i didnt have this issue on my ps3.\nI would suggest this and any other AC game (aside from Unity becuase it was a terrible game) to anyone else out there. Well Black Flag is basically a watery version of this, but still a fun story to go through. solid 8/10 game\nNote i think ubisoft needs to not churn out 2 games a year, focus on 1 and 1 alone. Please. Secondly, for the love of all that is sacred and holy REMOVE THE ABSTERGO MISSIONS. (The ones were you exit the Animus to go fix servers or whatever) Let me be clear NO ONE ENJOYS IT. Sure its neat and interesting, but i still hate doing it. Everytime it would come up when i played on my ps3 i would shut if off and go play ac4 or ac3. It takes away from the gameplay", "hours": 49.2, "username": "OmarAbdulHasanAliShaheedMohammed", "products": 155, "early_access": false}

That your opponents now use assassin equipment and moves and that your ship can be boarded in naval combat add a much needed strategic depth to the game, often making conflicts seem like more of a struggle. To be honest, I dread the inevitable return to Assassin protagonists - the Templars simply do not provide the satisfying challenge level to hunt that the Assassins do.\nThe story is one of the most complex and compelling of any of the series to date, with a lot of new information both about the present-day conflict and the struggles for power between the Templars and Assassins leading up to the French Revolution. The minigames are interesting and the sidequests are conveniently broken into settlements and neighbourhoods, making them feel much more digestible. The dialogue is satisfying and well written and the major characters are all interesting and likable.\nThe game exceeds Unity not only in being less buggy, but because of this separation of the game into smaller but accessible regions. As a player I find it more satisfying to clear out a settlement than to chase a particular subquest chain all across Paris. Unity's crowd blending and management was mechanically interesting, but not as refreshingly so as Rogue's counter-assassin play.\nThat said, the experience was still not perfect. There were bugs on occasion, particularly surrounding the boarding mechanic. More importantly, it suffers from the quest armors not having any noticeable abilities - after scouring the world for the totems or the Templar keys for unique armors, the fact that they do not have any statistical advantage is unsatisfying - the Precursor Armor from 4 is a perfect example of quest armor. For example, the Native Armor could have allowed blending in treetops (to avoid sentries while moving around forts) and the Medieval Templar Armor could have granted immunity to air assassinations (which are not difficult to deal with anyway, but it would have been something). In future I hope that quest armor provides a noticeable improvement over the base armor - particularly since it's usually less fashionable.", "hours": 45.8, "user_id": "76561198021840284", "username": "Retromach", "products": 307, "early_access": false}

You have to love \"clearing\" cities and other locations, as you will be doing this alot! I allso recomend going for the deluxe edition with the DLC packs as they do save you a lot of time and frustration. Allso adds a lot of options for making your ship and character more \"personal\". The game have the old mele-combat-system from \"AC III\", however you do get some awsome new wepons and the pistol setup from \"AC 4\". The controles are a bit different but you adapt quickly. And I will save the ship to ship combat for you to explore yourself. I personally love this and want a DLC that gives you the ability to have the \"Jackdaw\" in the harbor next to the \"Morigan\" just to change things up a bit. Allso a new seamap with much more shipwrecks ice and exploring type elements would be lovely, as that is exactly what this game is all about.\nThe storryline was not the best, but it worked. It was a short one though, need them to be longer next time. You sometimes become a bit bored of the main missons, however that is totaly fine because of all the exploring and sidequesting you can runn off and do :)\nOne more thing I like about this game is all the refferences to other AC games.\nI this game there is only one \"proper\" city. However, it fitts the bill perfectly for uss that lovet the \"Ezio\" series. Lots of small streets landmarks, tall and smal buildings, and perfect rooftops, no nocense! However I do still miss the by and refurnish part when it comes to stores and banks. There is one realy effective way to set your personal marking on the cities, towns and other locations, and it is a good one. But I would still realy love to have some more ways of doing this. Also bringing back the factions like brothels and thieves would be cool. I do see some of the tricks from the old games in the game, but not the full tricks, just references to the other games during missons.\nMy conclution for this game is that it is great when it comes to sidequesting, detracking and exploring. But the storryline could have been better and the main missons could have been more \"interesting\", however the plot is GREAT! The combat system is sometimes a bit slowish, maybe work on making it more fps friendly and making the reaction-time shorter. Allso it is great to have a lotof tools at your disposal. But maybe you should calm down a bit on the amount of sidearms one can have. You tend to get a bit overpovered sometimes. Ship combat system is great! But I do miss a way of making the ship quicker in combat(Maybe some purchesable upgrades, better sails, more sails, oiled ship, new mast, ect). I felt like I allways had just a little less speed then what I needed. However, same does not gofor turning, turning is perfect! I loved the exploring part, but for a game focused so much on exploring the ice I still feel like I got to little. More frosen water and ice please! As with both \"AC 4\" and \"AC Rogue\" I feel like we need the oportunity to bring bigger ships to the playground, maybe a DLC for a bigger ship at your diposal or something like that(but no \"Man O' War\", too OP). Allso miss some of the better elemnts of the old games. Maybe something for the next full game? I am left behind with a possitive feeling of this game and I do definetly recomend it. However do not try to save money on the limited game. These games do work best when you have all the content. Allso for the players that have never played \"AC\" before I do not recomend this to be your first. I recomend you play \"AC II\" first, then \"AC III\", after this \"AC 4\", and then this game. If not then i do struggle to believe you will understand the storryline and the plot.\n4 out of 6\n(Yes, this is lowish, however the game is still great.

A combination of excellent story, the return of well proven game mechanics as well as Black Flag's incredibly successful naval combat, and a brilliant soundtrack produce a brilliant secondary title that ties together the events of ACIII-AC Unity.\nStory: The story focuses around Assassin turned Templar Shay Cormac. The length of the story is not nearly that of other AC titles, but is far more rewarding. Admittably, I wish they'd spent more time building an attachment to every major Assassin, but the manner in which the story shows Shay's motivation for turning allows the moments when you do have to kill an Assassin to be enjoyable. There are parts where it seemed to run on a bit, I was not nearly as engaged in naval gameplay in this as I was in Black Flag thus those sections seemed far more irritating for me. The out-of-Animus story once again takes place in Abstergo Entertainment where you will intermittently be interrupted by Templar Agents to fix a server. Not the best, but it's better than Unity's.\nGameplay: Black Flag+Revelations+ACII. The game included the return of the zip line (sadly no hook blade), a new \"lift\", and the return of managing the city's economy. Of course there was Black Flag's naval combat and the movement felt identical to Black Flag. The gameplay of the ground missions reminded me most of ACII, though, possibly from the soundtrack.\nGraphics: Do not expect a massive improvement on Black Flag. There are areas where the game looks very nice, but other areas, such as the city you visit in the last memory, do not shine as much. Overall it is pleasant to look at, I ran it on my machine (i7, GT760, 8 gb RAM) very smoothly on max settings.\nOverall: I have to be fair because I was extremely disappointed in Far Cry 4 because it was just too similar to Far Cry 3. Rogue is very similar to Black Flag, but I do not share that disappointment with Rogue. While New York definitely gives off a more tropical vibe than ACIII, the game stands strong on its own. It is a fairly big world to explore that definitely looks dated when compared to titles that were not hindered by the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but still looks remarkable in certain areas. The story, if nothing else, is what you absolutely need to experience. It is a refreshing look at both orders that might turn your opinion slightly, but more importantly, it sews together the last several AC titles.", "hours": 46.6, "username": "Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage", "products": 302, "early_access": false}

For example *SPOILERS* in the opening sequence of this game you find yourself in Lisbon in 1755, site of one of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history.\nI sank (haha, because pirates) a HUGE amount of time in ACIV. I'm new to PC gaming, so I played on console, but I would guess I played for 60+ hours total. It had an awesome setting, good protagonist, and was brimming with stuff to do. I'm reviewing this game a bit early, having currently only played for about 8 hours. Thing is, it doesn't take an AC veteran like myself long to figure out what this game is. It truly is just a redeployment of the ACIV forumla. Luckily, it was one HELL of a winning formula, and this game succeeds BECAUSE it emulates it predecessor.

He feels guilt for killing people unnecessarily. He actually says no to those in charge because of morality. He feels like a human being. He gets sad. He gets angry. He feels guilt. He feels sympathy. He feels like a real person and the story, despite it being only about 6 hours, expands on that and throws you into this emotional twist of a game game that is his struggle to find truth and to seek his personal redemption. It is different from the other Assassin\u2019s Creed story while, yes, it has the typically Assassin\u2019s Creed revenge aspect, it is not focused around it like the other Assassin\u2019s Creed games are. It is one of the best stories in the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise.\nAdd that ontop of the beautiful open world where this time, the world actually encourages you to explore it. You feel the need as the world, whether it be the Arctic or River Valley (or the recycled New York city which is done better here than Assassin\u2019s Creed III, don\u2019t get me wrong, I just expect Assassin\u2019s Creed games not to recycle main locations), it feels fresh and immersive. I spent a good 10 to 15 hours just exploring the River Valley and the Arctic and loved every moment of it!\nAnd to visit the city of Halifax was one of my favourite things! I have been there in real life but to see Ubisoft\u2019s historical version of it was beautiful and immersive and I loved it!.\nOverall, you have to give this game a try. I spent almost a good 30 hours on it and most of it was exploring the beautiful open world. The only downside, the story is short, 6 hours for me and I took my time.

I don't know why, or how, but I can completely max it out on my rig with pretty steady 60 fps whereas AC IV and even AC III would make my computer bleed.  I think Ubisoft secretly released an amazingly optimized, fully-formed, and enjoyable AC game in the wake of Unity (not even going to try to run that mess on my PC).\nAs for the story, I LOVE it so far.  It picks up where AC IV left off in a way, putting you in the shoes of a selfish and hardheaded outsider.  Only this time, you're (hurrr spoiler) the \"bad guy,\" a Templar, dispelling those self-entitled and whiny Assassins.  As a pretty big AC fan, I have to say, it is weirdly satifisying to dispatch members of the Order, almost disconcertingly so.\nOh, you know how awesome it was messing up fools on the high seas in AC IV?  You can do that too, with improved and expanded combat, new weapons, and NEW SEA SHANTYS.\nGraphically, it looks like AC IV but runs like a dream.  Granted, I'm on a discontinued AMD 6100 and a GTX 770, but for me, it's really quite nice.  I guess it only took Ubisoft 2.5 games to get their engine optimized for PC...\nAfter AC II, this is my favorite in the series so far.  If you're a AC fan, buy it now.

While a step back from the fancy shmancy graphics, details, and crowds in AC:U, Rogue suffers from none of the many bugs that its sister game did, and its seemless gameplay combined with Shay\u2019s compelling story certainly make this game very much worth picking up.\nPOSITIVES:\n-\tMore of the duel naval/land action and side quests that made AC:BF such an interesting game.\n-\tCompelling new characters, and a few more chapters with some old favorites.\n-\tLargely bug free, relying and improving upon the mechanics developed in AC:BF\nNEUTRAL:\n-\tIt felt sometimes like a huge AC:BF DLC due to the similarities in game play.\nCONS:\n-\tThere are only 7 sequences as opposed to the amount that we have come to expect from AC games.  That said, this did not necessarily feel like a short game \u2013 there is plenty to do \u2013 but I do wish it had been longer.", "hours": 78.9, "user_id": "76561198056094886", "username": "Rawyvin", "products": 122, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "311560", "page": 160, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-03-28", "text": "It's ironic how Unity was promoted as the big next-gen game while Rogue was underplayed as AC 4.5 for current-gen. As we've seen in the past few months, Unity has flopped horrendously while Rogue has stood out as a worthy successor to the AC franchise. Sadly, much of this is mostly because Rogue is simply NOT Unity.\nThe fact of the matter is that Rogue WORKS. The game is pretty much an extension of Black Flag. It doesn't change much, if anything, but that isn't a bad thing. Black Flag was exciting. Great soundtrack, fast-paced combat, huge world and naval exploration. Rogue has a somewhat smaller scale, but has more areas in New York, the North Atlantic and North America. But it has the same charm and the same feel. Perhaps it could've used its setting more effectively - lots of locations aren't used and New York is mostly a backdrop to several story missions, while Black Flag took you everywhere. But it's still better than Unity.\nThe story works well too. Ubisoft seems to be trying very hard to make memorable characters like Ezio but in the span of only one game compared to the AC2 trilogy. Shay Cormac is a relatable character - not as epic as Ezio, but within the constraints of only one game, Shay's story comes across very nicely. Sure, it's a token rogue story, but Shay pulls it off really well, going through the moral conflict, becoming jaded with the Assassins and becoming an integral part of the Templars.\nPerhaps the most underrated part of Rogue is how it connects the AC universe together. It brings back Black Flag and Freedom Cry through its heritage of older characters. It serves as the prequel to ACIII, with references to George Washington, Haytham Kenway and the fall of Achilles. And, as an extra bonus, it links into the events of Unity. If anything, Rogue stands out by making the other AC games better. The supporting ensemble complement Shay nicely, making the cinematic experience more enjoyable than Arno's attempts in Unity.\nThe modern-day story is also very well developed. You are once again an Abstergo Entertainment employee, but this time under the control of the Templars directly. It introduces new supporting characters and a whole new aspect of the modern story while retaining the familiar setting from Black Flag, It really does play out as a sequel to Black Flag, and is executed far more fluidly than Unity's excuse for a modern story. In fact, it seems that Unity was made by Abstergo rather than Ubisoft as a ploy to make Assassin-based games utter crap while making Templars games really good.\nAnd that would make a good plot twist.\nUltimately, Rogue stays true to a working formula. There are elements that don't make a lot of sense, but we've come to expect that from open-world games and the series. The story is satisfying, the gameplay is sweet and the soundtrack is epic. Surely, there can be no greater nostalgia trip than when you open the menu and hear Ezio's and Connor's themes mashed together. Rogue respects the series and in turn forms a deep bond with everything that came before it. Perhaps it is a greater unifier than Unity.", "hours": 32.9, "username": "nusensei", "products": 401, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

However the story is still pretty bad for it, when in Rogue the story is great.\n\nIn Unity I barely got to know any of the main characters, aside from Arno, Elise, and Bellec. However in Rogue you get to see characters that you met in prior games, but also new, fun characters. Also you gotta love the naval combat.\nAnother thing that was wrong with Unity's story was how it was arranged. That Bellec fight shouldn't have been in the middle of the game, but at the end, and should've had it be a sub-plot in which he was killing members of the Creed and Arno was trying to uncover the mystery. In Rogue, though, they aranged it perfectly, from being an assassin in the beginning, becoming a Templar in the middle, and finally at the end finding out what was up with those messed up memories.\nThis game did much more to further the Assassin's Creed story in a whole than Unity did, in my opinion.

I was a bit sceptical of his leaving the Assassins but it fits in at the end. Also it is nice to see things from the Templars eyes. It adds a perspective that is nice. I am not spoiling the game by telling you that this is the story of a renegade Assassin.\nThe best bit is when it fills in story blanks from other AC games in my opinion.

I have to give them credit though because there wasn`t much that the developers had to do to make this game. The re-use of GFX and characters from both 3 and 4 with some new additions and the exact same mechanics and game flow as 4 with a new story line pretty much sums up the making of this game.\nThe first thing that stood out to me was that this game to date was the smoothest running right after being released; I was able to max out everything and got a solid 60 FPS 95 percent of the time. The scenery was another thing that really stood out; the colors and dynamics are really beautiful in this game and I often had to stop just to look around, this is a nice change in pace from other darker themed games. You`ll see where a lot of buildings/characters and scenery were re-used, but at least this time when your sailing around you`re not looking at the exact same landscape like you did in B.F. and running around in the snow made a comeback which was really fun in 3.\nSo we finally get an Irish Assassin and he turns... well.. rogue =\\ Even in video game land we can`t catch a break! It is interesting that the writers went down the templar route to keep things fresh. The story brings back some characters, but if you didn`t play Unity, 4 or 3 you`ll be in the dark. The big problem? The campaign/story was short, in fact the shortest in the series which is why I call it a DLC, you spend most of your time exploring and gathering treasure and if you just play the campaign you can be done in under a few hours. Also, the short story also didn`t leave time for you to find the cool treasures like the different armor and Altair's sword set let alone be able to use them during gameplay like in brotherhood and the wolf armor.\nNY was laid out like Boston was in 3 and there`s no horse so you had to run around or fast travel which sucked and the stalkers really became a huge pain. You can`t run while in eagle vision so you don`t know where they are and have to rely on the annoying whispers to know when they`re close, but it didn`t really matter unless you were exploring and finding treasures because you didn`t spend much time in NY during the story.\nHunting, crafting, ship upgrades, naval campaign and legendary battles all made a return in this game (legendary battles are much easier which was a bummer). The developers really took the best parts of AC 3 and 4 and made this game which made it really enjoyable to play, it`s too bad it was too short and we didn`t have the stealth movements of Unity because this could have been the best AC game to date, especially after Unity`s failed attempt at upgradable weapons/armor/character and multiplayer campaign; I mean if I want to play an in depth RPG I`ll play games like Baldur`s Gate and if I want to play with people I`ll play games like WOW, but not the place for the AC franchise, stick with what works, stay unique.\nAs of March 24th 2015 there are still some movement bugs and climbing issues that really make you want to throw your mouse, I even got stuck off the playable map a few times and had to reset/fast travel to reset.\nSo if you loved 3 and especially 4 than this is worth the money, if you`re a fan of the series but didn`t like 3 or 4 wait for the sale.", "hours": 53.9, "username": "Avenger", "products": 128, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

As someone who has played a lot of AC3 and 4, there was really nothing new here, and I found it rather boring. Even the story, which is mainly what I was interesting in checking out, was a waste. The characters are all two-dimensional, and the protagonist's motivations are paper-thin. Sure, this has become standard for AC at this point, but still sad to see the wasted potential here. All the interesting stuff is actually hidden away in Templar letters that you must seek out as side objectives. And to top it off, [Spoiler Alert!] I was not happy to have to kill Adewale. Wasn't worth it! [End Spoiler]\nThis should have been a $20-30 stand-alone expansion to AC4. As such, I recommend to anyone still debating buying it to just wait for a good sale on it.

It plays in the Northern Atlantic, River Valley and New York and has a bit of intrigue with you playing as an actual Templar for the largest part of the game. The controls can be a bit dodgy with Shay not quite listening at times or grabbing hold of the wrong things since it does not have quite the control options as with Unity, it also looks worse and unfortunately the cities and towns are much less alive with worse architecture and less historical information than Unity.\nShip combat does return, but unfortunately it is painfully easy with all but the last legendary battle being quite easy to go through. You are never truly in danger and Shay can easily take anyone on without a sweat, thus the game runs the risk of getting quite boring with the repetitive and bland ship combat and melee combat. It is unfortunate then that Ubisoft has not taken a better look at some of the games where ship combat is done better, such as Sea Dogs II (Also going under the name of Pirates of the Carribbean even though it has nothing to do with that) which has much more interesting and challenging combat. Which, by the by, you might want to install New Horizons for if that peaked your interest. It's actually a must.\nBut it is another Assassin creed game, the setting may interest for some time or perhaps the ship combat grips you despite the flaws.

Free running, but only on paths the level designer allow. So, you end up in many spots, where the ground is just above your knees, and you can neither climb, or jump. You can however take the long way around, which the level designer decided was the only option.\nAt least, it does not have all those stupid dancers/fighters for hire :).\nIt does however, suffer from AC1 syndrome, which is grind... Blackflag was grindy, but the amount remained reasonable, coupled with the ship/pirating which was kinda new(with the boarding mixed with all other naval stuff going on). Rogue does not benefit from this \"new feeling\", on top of this, the map is a LOT bigger than AC4 it seems... sound good right? Well, not so much. When you have only about 5 things you can do, but you need to do them, a LOT. That is grind, it's not enjoyable. AC1 had the same issue imo...\nThe game also suffers, like most AC games, from consoleportization, an unfortunately common disease these days... As such, every climbable points, will look exactly the same, as usual in AC games I guess. Once you've seen the 3 or 4 possible climbable textures, well, you know how it goes in other AC games... I wish they'd reworkd the maps and textures, pc's are not console, they can handle a little variety... please, enough with level designs made entirely of copy/paste from like 20 items :(.\nSo the levels feels a lot like AC3/4 materials, slightly altered, and off you go. It does not feel like they bothered to design new models or textures. If they have, the addition is invisible.\nThe voice acting from the non cinematics is atrocious. If you do not speak french, you'll probably be sorta ok. If you speak french, prepare to be annoyed very quickly... The npc's keeps repeating the same 2 sentences, over and over and over and over and over... It is utterly ridiculous, and there is no immersion at all. AC4 felt a lot better on this point imo. This is particularly bad after helping out soldiers in those mini battlefield side activities. At the end of the fight, they just keep saying there'll be double ration, the captain is an idiot, and we won, non stop, forewer it seems :S. I am hoping it is just a bug, and will be fixed, as it is truly annoying. NPC's in towns/villages also seem to do it, with their not so random chatter, it is breaking the poor amount of immersion there is.\nIn short, they \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed it up :)\nI'm nowhere near done with the story, because the game bores me so much, it is actually hard to finish it, due to boredom.\nA new \"activity' was added, which consist of helping soldier in small battles. You'll get a couple of different objectives, which includes destroy something (one or more), kill the captain, and cut the flag. So, same as a boarding, except it happens in a forest... and this is where it screws things up... to cut the flag, you need to be anoymous, while the flag is usually surrounded with enemies... PRoblem is, if the allies all die, you loose and have to wait to a reset... which means, because they are usually utterly worthless, you'll have to run to the flag, and hope no enemies tags you, otherwise, you'll usually be screwed due to the AI being utterly stupid.\nCouple of new weapons have been added, which are the same as before, but with a small AOE effect on them, so hardly \"new\" per say.\nAnother addition is \"stalkers\". Assassin's trying to kill you. While I understand the concept of it, they are simply annoying. While you're trying to hide from guards, or simply exiting a mission area, being surprised by a stalker is fairly annoying. I don't really like those, sure they fit the lore, but do they REALLY need to be that many virtually everywhere?

Anyways, Rogue is a further refined version of Black Flag, with a fun, gorgeous, and expanded naval section and the same Creed land based stealth we've grown to love (or hate). For me, as one who loves the classic AC experience and adored what AC3 and BF did with the Naval parts, this game is the true next-gen sequel in place of Unity. While Rogue visuals aren't quite as detailed on land as Unity, the sea and ships are stunning.  And while Rogue doesn't let you crank up the visuals like Black Flag did to show off its lush jungles, in exchange, you get a vastly smoother experience. Black Flag was very difficult to keep running at 30-45fps without the aid of 3rd party drivers and while I can't speak for Unity's PC counterpart, I doubt it eclipsed 30fps on console or PC in its first few months. Rogue, on the other hand has not dropped below 59fps in my 20+ hours so far (i5 4690k, gtx970) and the few visual options it does offer do make look very pretty indeed.\nIn short, if you're a fan of Black Flag and are looking for it's true successor, then look no further..", "hours": 46.3, "username": "BigxRedx", "products": 217, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

The optimization is damn near perfect, the seamless control switching from controller to mouse+keyboard is amazingly easy.  The touchscreen menu functions are great for people playing on a touch laptop.  Gameplay wise, it's pretty much the same as Black Flag, except now there are more incapacitation options.  The locations are beautiful, the story rival's Ezio's in quality.\nOverall, the game is fantastic.  Though no game is perfect, and Rogue is certainly no exception to that.  Like every Assassin's Creed game, the parkour system is imperative to the game's success.  The free-running in Rogue is amazing, the terrain was well built and designed for fast paced running and killing, though the place where the parkour falls a bit short, are in settlements and New York, where there are many buildings with angled roofs.  Now there is a slight problem with climbing up an angled roof from the side.  This problem makes it so you occasionally freeze in place and can't climb up or down until you shuffle to either side before you can move again, even though you should really have no problem with climbing up.  I'm sure this will get patched soon, as it is an easy fix.  The ocean combat is pretty good too.  I haven't played much of Black Flag, and I hated the ship combat from AC III, but I hear it's great in Black Flag, and it's not that big of a deal to keep something that works very well in another game that involves the same kind of setting.  Since this is an Ubisoft game, the enemy spawning is awful, and none more so, than in the ocean.  There WILL be times when you board a ship after incapacitating it, and after you are through collecting your stuff, there would be another ship bearing down on you.  Believe me, when you get good at handling the Morigan, you will be able to dispatch these fools easily, and you will even be able to take on a Man-o-war without much trouble.  But then again, if you are coming to this from Black Flag, you would already have plenty of experience with ocean maneuvering.    Combat wise, it's pretty great.  A major step up from the AC III engine.  Now, there are no longer whole platoons of soldiers that track you down to kill you for bumping into someone.  Hiding is pretty easy, because there are bushes pretty much everywhere, and you can always use them to sneak around and take out a couple of guards, or you can play it non-lethally and just sneak.\nAll in all, Rogue is an amazing game compared to previous installments in the AC series.  I would highly suggest Rogue over Unity (if you are looking for story quality)  Unity was a bland, dry Ctrl C+ Ctrl V of Ezio's story, Rogue has the main character (as well as you) thinking about your allegiance to the Assassins, and how your ideals may differ greatly from them.", "hours": 61.3, "username": "Hartley Harms", "products": 76, "early_access": false}

I'm glad I picked this game up, and I will continue to open all the chests and fragments until I get to 100%.\nOne thing that did bother be about this game was the weapon variety. The airgun is cool, as it comes with darts and grenade, both with different kinds that you can load into your weapon.

It was kind of sad to see that this huge potential of a new weapon was short-cut with an AOE and single target option, but it still was fun to experiment with it.\nDespite the game's main story being fairly short, it was still extremely fun and it held my attention.

I played Unity and heavily enjoyed it, despite what everyone has said about it's technical problems. But I loved it and so I ended up pre-ordering this game. I then played through it and I must say, this game blows some of the previous games out of the water because of it's rather darker storyline and the insane amount of stuff to do in the world, surpassing even Black Flag's scope of activities and side stuff. It really is an absolute shame that this game will be passed on by most gamers for 3 reasons. 1. It's a last gen game and everyone is more interested in next gen tech and gaming. 2. Unity's bad reputation has turned many people off from the series which is really unfortunate because they'll miss out on this amazing iteration in the series. and 3. Simply because it's a AAA title. This game is an amazing tie in to AC 3, AC4, and Unity. I would say that this game is pretty perfect on all cylinders. My only real complaint is that the campaign is probably the shortest campaign yet in the franchise, comprised of only 6 sequences.

When launch day arrived, I saw that people were giving it good reviews so decided to get it. I'm glad I did.\nShay is an interesting and worthy character. This is an interesting and worthy game with a story that I appreciate having the privilege of experiencing. Yes, it can get uncomfortable at times having to do the things Shay does. However, it was also innovative of them to have a game from the point of view of someone that goes rogue.\nRogue feels and plays a lot like Black Flag. However, story wise, it seems more fitting as a companion piece to 3. There's even a connection to--well, I won't spoil it but if and when you do see it coming, it's quite a neat little addition.\nIt's not perfect and I admit that graphics wise, it does feel somewhat dated compared to Unity. However, the simple fact is that, Rogue is a fun game, a lot more fun then Unity. Some will find the combat too easy. While it is easy (aside from some opponents that can be a pain to fight) compared to Unity, or at least easier, it's still a good game.\nYes, as with Black Flag, there are ship upgrades you more or less need to have, some of which require a lot ship boarding to be able to afford that can get repetitive. Wether this is an issue or not depends on how much you enjoy the ship combat sections. If you don't, it is a bit of a drawback. However, unlike Black Flag, there are far less of the at times infuriating tailing missions that plagued Black Flag. So, at least we have that.  Also, unless I'm remembering wrong, there isn't quite as much emphasis on the ship missions (though there still are plenty) so the issue of having to upgrade the ship while there, isn't omnipresent.\nHaving played the main story through to completion (with plenty still left to do side activity wise), I admit that Rogue doesn't feel quite as large as the other games. However, it's still an overall worthy experience where the annoyances that pop-up from time to time (that in all fairness are a part of just about any Assassin's Creed game) don't seem to drag the overall game down. In fact, the annoyances are the sort you may well forget about or at least try to forget about as to not taint the game because of one small annoying part or part of a mission that went wrong etc.\nI'll end this review saying that this *is* an Assassin's Creed game. It's a good game that shows us some interesting things that we perhaps didn't know we were missing from the more recent games.

So far, I've played the first, second and Brotherhood, so I never knew what would happen with the storyline of the series from then on, until I played this game.\nTo my surprise, I've clocked in 17 hours into the game, doing some side activities and the main storyline; I'm beyond impressed on how fun and immersiveful this game can be and the lore behind it pushing the envelope for the series' storyline\nObviously, given the description of this game, you follow the tale of Shay Cormac, a once loyal Assassin following Achilles, the Brotherhood's Mentor of the American Colonial, who became a ferocious Templar Hunter, taking down his past brother in arms. I won't give you much of the story, because would deny you of the pleasure this game has to offer. Simply put, it offers you the perspective of the Templar Order, giving you insight of the eternal war Between the Assassins and the Templar.\nAlthough the story itself is quite commendable, the lore scattered around in the game just simply enhances it completely, giving you incentives to explore your surroundings and understanding the characters you meet in the game. It also offers you many audio logs, which just pushed it even more, giving more life and character to the world of AC.\nThey're quite lengthy and very enjoyable to hear, should you pursue all of them, but that doesn't diminish the game's storyline should you ignore them.\nThe gameplay itself is quite fun and smooth, from my experience playing, although there are some hiccups here and there, concerning the counter move against several enemies, but that might be just me playing badly/not paying attention enough. It also offers a lot of variety in taking down enemies, such as using darts to make civvies go \"berserk\" or putting snipers to sleep while darting your way towards your assassination target. You have bombs, darts, pistols and other such tools to achieve your success, giving you more freedom as to how you want to complete a certain mission.\nThe game is absolutely wonderful looking and I'm surprised how well I'm running the game, at a solid 60FPS with everything at maximum capacity. You'll have an easy time getting those beautful shots of the sunset while sailing in the North Atlantic, or panoramic views atop a church. It truly is a beauty playing this game.\nAlthough I'll keep this rather short, since I can go on and on and on, I'm grateful for my friend gifting me this game and I'm planning to finish the game completely, with nothing amiss.

Since AC:3 it's my firm belief that Ubisoft has gotten out of touch with what makes Assassin's Creed such a great francise. Gone are the days of mystery and intrigue, of skillful assassinations and deep character development. In my opinion AC:1 was an absolute masterpiece, with AC: Revelations finishing off Ezio's story perfectly. Since then Assassin's Creed's quality as a series has diminished. Technologically the Assassin's Creed series has flourished, with the world and people becoming much more beautiful. However the story has fallen flat, the idea of 'genetic memories' and Abstergo is being stretched thin beyond its limits. We all thought after Ezio we would finally see the modern day AC game, but that does not seem to be within Ubisofts sights. They wish to continue milking the series with progressively worse off games. Unity was a turning point for Ubisoft. If they mess up the next game, thats it for the series in my eyes.\nAll of this aside, AC: Rogue does make me happy. It may not be technologically the best AC game, with last gen graphics and none of the improvements that AC: Unity recieved (Although this is more of a blessing considering how shoddy Unity's engine was) However AC: Rogue story once again makes me giddy to play the game, to push forward with the new character, Shay Cormac, my new favorite protaganist. He is the first Assassin to become more self aware since Altaiir, and see that the world is not so black and white, Templars and Assassins. After seeing the darkness and ignorance of Assassin's he goes off on his own, to seek his own path. This leads him to become Templar, and therefore fufill his wish to help the world and atone for his sins.\nCormac is easily one of the best protaganist since Ezio, with an amazing voice actor and real emotions and a true goal. Not only that, but he is also the most well-equipped of the protaganists. Not since Ezio has an assassin had so much gear to choose from. This makes playing as Cormac exciting to play both as a stealth character and a fighter.\nThe game also loses out on having Assassin minions but it gains the fresh mechanic of constantly being hunted by Assassins, which you must dispatch.\nIs Assassin's Creed Rogue a good game? That you will have to decide for yourself. As a whole it is one of my favorite in the series, with the best leading character, the biggest arsenal, fully realized naval warefare, new mechanics, and the chance to be a Templar. The story is short but intense, it took me 15 hours to complete with slight deviation, and I have barely scratched the surface with extra content, as usual AC games are satisfying to complete 100%.\nI have changed sides. The Templars are humanities salvation. See the world through Shay Patrick Cormac's eyes and decide for yourself.

Maybe it's just nostalgia, but I think even AC3 looked better than this game.  Yes I know it was released on Xbox360 and PS3, but that's no excuse to have black characters with white hands.

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 165, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-03-15", "text": "WARNING!, to understand this Review, you must have played/seen Assassin's Creed IV and to an extent Assassin's Creed 3. Do not issue a bad rating on the merits of you entering in the franchise. Sorry, friend, this review is not for you.\nThis game can also be described as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag 1.5. When I finished, I almost wondered why the Installation didn't come with patch notes instead of a features description. Don't get me wrong, it's good, bloody damn good, but read this for a minute to understand why.\nThe Good \"Patch Changes\"\n- The new Air Rifle is amazing, and doesn't look as, and I hesitate to use the word here, racist or shoe-horned as a bow and a blowpipe. It provides a lore-friendly way of dispatching your foes as well as later receiving a Grenade launcher, which allows you to stun, berserk or just explode a large group of enemies. It opens tactical opportunities to spark a large group of enemies to berserk instead of just one.\n- The Outfit selection takes a big dump on the \"15 colours of robes & hoods\" thing and presents you for once with varied outfits that don't require dlc. I completed the game in the uniform of a Royal Navy Captain.\n- The Environment is much more varied. The River Valley is - as the name would suggest - a large map of rivers where you can encounter medium-sized ships and set up clever ambushes. The Ocean map is much wider and you can capture Man'o'War ships there.\n- You are a templar now, which means the United Kingdom won't bother you anymore, unless you want to, atleast in the cities. backstab, shoot and murder to your hearts content!\n- You can now murder civilians in a lore-friendly way. Instead of arbitrarily getting de-synched at the third mishap like a kindergarten boy being sent home because he threw gobs of sand around, you will now have tough-as-\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665e bounty hunters sent after you. they will kill you unless you are smart and shoot them first. But it's lore-friendly and more immersive that way.\n- Say goodbye to the always-on, required-to-progress Kenway's Fleet! That's right, the Fleet now is entirely offline, and gives you not only junk househlod decorations but also some very nifty Items and beautiful cosmetics. Also, it's optional, so if you are not interested in the Naval Campaign, good riddance for you, but it will generally give you money, as it works on the ingame currency now, the pound, instead of the arbitrary-a*s \"Gems\" that were ripe for mobile mini-transactions from the word go.\n- New York makes its return from AC3. I find it to be the more ugly of the two cities, boston was always more to my liking, but they managed to spice the city up by restoring the burned-down districts and adding a less depressive day-night cycle. Since I played AC3 the colour orange gives me spontaneous cataract!\n- Getting boarded is fun. It eventually ends like the other boardings, you can only be boarded by assassin brigs and pirate-hunters and you might lose up to 7 crewmen, but it's fun.\n- The Elite Upgrades for your ship are not buried in some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 places that you will only visit once for the entire game\n- You now have frequent ammunition chests in the cities to refill your special ammunition for free. It gives a shoddy amount of bullets, but I'll get to that eventually.\n- The sailors of the Morrigan look like Royal Navy sailors. BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES!\nThe bad changes... and yes, there are some.\n- When you capture an enemy fortress, your boarding crew does not follow you on land, which is sad. I liked the atmospheric fortress battles even though the teleporting ship crew in ACIVBF incited philosophical discourse with other players/co-workers at the water dispenser.\n- The highest-Level set of pistols and the only pair of the main game that kills grenadiers/captains/assassins in one shot is locked behind a challenge. Alternatively, you can buy the DLC and aquire the Russian Flintlock pistols. It's just a scheme to funnel more games into buying the DLC.\n- Shay, the Protagonist, is a dunce at looting conventional bullets from corpses. While Edward could restock himself twice over by just stabbing some guards in the middle of the street, Mr. Cormac needs his reading glasses whiped for him because he only loots one or two cartridges off a rifleman. This is a big deal, because in the marine sessions, assassins hunts and time-based objectives as well as the main missions, you will be heavily relying on your pistols. Unless, of course, you are sneaky. Which I ain't.\n- Ammunition does not refill when you get onto your ships. They really don't have a crew chest where I could \"borrow\" some of these precious blackpowder lifesavers? REALLY? Edward Kenways crew was cool about that. meh.\n- The story is a bit short for my taste, but that is only because they had to develop this game alongside the *spontaneous irony* colossus of cultural value and perfection *irony end, cough cough* that was Assassin's Creed: Unity.\n-IN SHORT-\nIf you couldn't already guess, I am going to recommend this game, because my complaints are all tiny things.\nSo, that's about all I got so far. I might add more grins or gripes in the future. Keep the discussion in the comments civilized. And have fun if you decide to buy!

I think it's best to compare to AC Liberation. Liberation introduced a character tied to Connor Kenway in AC3, much like this game introduces a character connecting to Haytham Kenway, Adewale, and Achillies Davenport. I feel that, in terms of lore, this game holds a lot more weight than Liberation and is overall a more polished and envigorating experience. It returns to the excellent naval gameplay of AC4 whilst bringing back some favorite characters from AC3. In addition, Shay Cormac allows us to experience the Templar Order in a new light. When we got to play as Haytham Kenway in AC3 we got a glimpse at what the Order was really about and how their goals aren't so different from the assassins. Shay offers this same opportunity - as players used to fighting for the assassin cause, Shay enables us to question their true motives, making for a really interesting story.\nThis game was really overshadowed by Unity in many ways. With Unity being the 'bigger' title of the year, Rogue was out on it's own plane. As one who has finished both games, I can honestly say that Rogue is better in almost every way and it's seriously underrated. I hope that this game gets more attention because people deserve to know that this game carries great weight in the AC universe and it's concepts could and should be given the opportunity to return later on in other games to continue to delve into the understanding of the ideological war between Assassin and Templar.", "hours": 35.6, "username": "Chairman_", "products": 195, "early_access": false}

That poor excuse of a DRM is harming the legitimate players like me who bought the game and does nothing for the pirates who torrented the game without ever being annoyed by the stupid thing. Uplay is down? You can't play, but a pirate can. Uplay deleted your savegames? Has happened in AC:Unity for some people. Pirates don't have that problem either. Yesterday I had a message coming up during launching the game that said achievements have failed to synchronize or something. Today it's still coming up but somehow I can run the game now.\nThird, why does every Ubisoft game have to be packed with collectibles. I'm kinda obsessed about that sort of thing, what they call OCD but it isn't OCD obviously, but in this game they just drive me nuts.

This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations.\nObviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it.\nTouching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.\nSome things i disagree with:\n- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)\n- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic.\n- Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.\nGive this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less \"land play\" which made me happy.\nHave to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable.\nP.s Dont take the ship away again.\nCheers,\nLordelicious.", "hours": 41.5, "username": "Duchess AKA Ace Fighter", "products": 47, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

For reasons unknown (They're totally known) Ubisoft delayed Rogue for Pc by like 5 months. A bold move that paid off.\nMy machine is poop garbage. GT 640, i3. Turrible. Black Flag at 20 FPS. I had no hopes for Rogue, but damnit, it proved me wrong. 60 steady fps on medium settings, it really never dipped at all. The game looks the same as Black Flag, but it isn't badly ported.\nThe story of Rogue is a tale of tragedy. We follow Shay Patrick Cormac, Assassin and five time winer of the coveted, 'Most Irish Name' award. Cormac is guided by Achilles, Connor's angry black mentor from Assassins Creed 3. After it turns out that Achilles is\nCormac runs away and is adopted by the Templars. Now he  is quite angry, and wants to assassinate his former assassin brothers, in a cruel twist of fate. The story will finally wrap up the Kenway saga. It will Link Assassins Creed 3, Black Flag, Unity, and even WATCH_DOGS.\nThe gameplay is like Black Flag, with a little bit of Black Flag thrown in. You sail your boat, burning boats and doing pirate things. (You're not a pirate.) It also has a bit of AC3 in it, with a frontier styled map. There are also a TON of collectibles. I love collecting things. And stuff, can't forget stuff. I've spent at least 20 hours just collecting and admiring the scenery. For a game set in such a horrible era like the 7 year's war, it sure is damn pretty.\nThe music is a a mix of all the previous AC themes put together in beautiful Frankenstein harmony. The main theme consists of Ezio's Family, with a bit of AC4 and AC3 thrown in. It's to symbolize that this is the end of the previous gen of Assassins Creed, and a new, buggier generation has been birthed.\nThe bad parts about Rogue is the fact that it is about 8 hours long if you do nothing but the story. There are bugs that have transfered over from Black Flag that they never fixed. Most (Like 95%) of Cormac's animations are borrowed directly from Edward Kenway, and the new ones are very stiff and awkward looking.\nRogue has become one of my favourite PC games by Ubisoft in recent years, especially since it's not a horrible monstrosity.", "hours": 46.3, "username": "Mally", "products": 642, "found_funny": 208, "early_access": false}

It is not haggard by bugs and general Hiccups like Assassins Creed: Unity which up until recently, began to be playable. However, was it worth the wait, is this a Assassins Creed: Blackflag with a different skin.\nWe trade the gorgeous Caribbean for the cold bitter North Atlantic. It shows within the few moments of gameplay when you no longer see the lush turquiose waters and see dark blues. Considering that this game uses the same game engine (Anvilnext) as Black Flag, you should not expect any ground breaking graphics like with the case with Unity. If you played Black Flag, it is basically the same. If your toaster could run Black Flag, you could run this game, and then some as with the tweaking for optimization was already done for Black Flag. One can assume that a lot of the areas are copy and pasted from Assassins Creed 3 such as New York, but in fact, those maps have been Redone to have the same amount of \"life\" as the towns in Black Flag had.\nWhat makes Rogue stand out, is the fact that you play as Shay Cormac, who is a Templar. The theme of the predator has turned into prey is enjoyable, as when you do hunt for assassins, they do employ assassin tactics on you. Rogue is best if you have played Assassins Creed 3, Black Flag, and Unity. A lot of characters from those games do appear in Rogue as either some from Shays time, or from Connors time. But for new comers, the game does provide excellent detail on each character, as well as historical videos to catch you up to speed as rewards in some puzzles. The story is predictable, but it does show insight on the Templar way of thinking.\nIf you played Black Flag, then Rogue is similar in it's play style. Assassinate people, ride a boat, and be a privateer. However, there are new elements to the game, such as having a dart gun, using your ship to break the ice, and actually having to be weary of other ships attempting to board my ship.\nThe game however is not without its gripes, it is the same formula. Black Flag was ground breaking in the sense that you had new mechanics in the game. To be honest, this feels like a cash grab, but a cash grab in the sense that Ubisoft cares a tiny bit for the players that the game itself is actually playable on launch.\nIs this worth $50? Yes it is, well to me that is. It is the same content but creatively used to provide a refreshing experience. It is a good thing that this is not priced at the normal premium of $60. Quite honestly, this is one of the most refined Assassins Creed that has used the AnvilNext engine, and we would have to wait a few more games after Unity to get the same refinement.", "hours": 22.7, "username": "Nomad22", "products": 217, "early_access": false}

I wanted to skip this title because of the poor state of Unity in general upon release, but I am a fan of the series and so I blindly pre-ordered it taking yet another risk.  I can safely say this game so far is very well done.\nThe frame rate seems smooth and although I expected the graphics to look no better than Black Flag, being on the same engine, I have to say the games looks better in almost every respect.  It is no AC Unity by any means, but the anniemations, physics, and details are pushed further than Black Flag with improved frame rate.  AC Rogue runs great. It is obvious the extra six months in developement for PC was worth the wait.\nThe gameplay is smooth and what you would expect from AC.  The game plays just like AC Black Flag. I am not saying this game is without glitches, but I have not experienced any crashes at all.  I have however jumped out of trees and landed under part of the map structure like a rock twice.  Porting out to another area solves the problem, but remains an inconvenience. I also dislike the camera view that oddly puts me out of combat at times and I must center my view to correct it.\nThe story line is impressive and sets the transition for you to become a templar. I never thought Unbisoft would pull this story off so well after seven years of killing templars (release of Assassin's Creed 2007).  I found the story itself a little lacking in that it seemed rushed at times or like a book that has had several chapters cut out to meet a page limit. But overall, the story does what it is ment to do and it does it well. Spoiler alert, if you have played AC III, you may have some mixed feeling about this story line.\nIf you have played earlier Assassin's Creed games, specifically Black Flag, you will feel right at home.  If you have only played Unity, it is a step down in just about every respect except the bugs and lack of polish found with Unity's release.  AC Rogue is designed on a dated engine for last gen consoles but it truely offers one of the best AC experiences to date.

The description of the story in this one doesnt do it credit.

I haven't come across any storms (tornadoes, rogue waves, etc) so I don't know if they exist (one of the things I loved about Black Flag).  Blowing up ice bergs in battle is neat as it causes a small wave that damages smaller ships.  The story feels like it is lacking a little bit right now, it's not really explaining much of anything.  Hopefully that picks up.  Combat mechanics are fluid and ship battles are still epic even without the storms (again I don't know if they exist or not).  By the way, you can pick up bodies and toss them in the bushes which is a big plus.\nI do feel that it doesn't quite live up to the epicness of Black Flag like I had hoped, but fun nonetheless.

The story is set in the mid-18th century during the Seven Years' War, and follows the story of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin turned Templar. Gameplay in Rogue is very similar to AC Black Flag with mixtures of ship-based naval exploration and third-person land-based exploration with loads of new features added. Naval aspects from the previous games will return with you controlling Shay's ship, Morr\u00edgan.\nA New feature include new ship-based weapons including releasing an oil slick which can then be ignited, Puckle guns, and the ability for enemies to board Morr\u00edgan during ship to ship combat. The arctic environment also features into naval gameplay and exploration, as certain icebergs can be rammed with an icebreaker. In combat, the game introduces a air rifle, which now allows Shay to silently take out enemies at a distance. The air rifle can be outfitted with a variety off different projectiles, such as firecrackers.\nAlso you can use a grenade launcher, which fires shrapnel grenades and berserks. Hand-to-hand combat has been slightly altered, now the enemy attacks also can be countered with timing, similar to the Batman: Arkham game franchise. Enemy Assassins feature archetypes similar to previous games, using the skills you used throughout the series; they can hide in the bushes, blend in with crowds, and perform air attacks against you. The poison gas can now be used as an environmental weapon, and now Shay also has a gas mask that can mitigate its effects.\n\nReflecting on Shay's role as a Templar, the game now introduces a new side mission: Assassin Interception.They mirror the Assassination side missions in previous games. After you intercepted a messenger pigeon that is carrying a assassination contract. He must prevent Templar agents from being assassinated by finding and killing Assassins hidden nearby.\nI would give Assassin's Creed Rogue an overall rating of 10/10 stars. The PC port is very well done with no FPS or any kind of other issues. This is definitely a MUST buy for fans because I'm just absolutely without a doubt 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Rogue will not disappoint at all!.", "hours": 142.4, "username": "\u2605TheAssass1n\u2605", "products": 334, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "311560", "page": 176, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-03-09", "text": "So far I love the game. The characters are so fresh and interesting and Shay is portrayed really well so far. I have now played 4.2 hours an definetely feel that sam addicting vibe I had from ACIV:\nThe mechanics are familiar to anyone who played Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. The best way to describe it it going in methodical, but also quick so as to get 100% on missions. So far only playing as an assassin is identical to Edward Kenway in Black Flag as you start off with dual weapons, a sword and knife, but new animations are nice and its cool to see Shay fight with the smaller weapon. The parkour/movement is next to perfect as you'll occassionally wonder if you can climb some rocks or materials or simply take a few tries to climb trees or builidings. The naval battles come back again and are as fun as ever with the 4 direction shooting system being directly taken from Black Flag, which I thought did much better than Assassin's Creed III. Long story short: If you loved Assassin's Creed Black Flag gameplay combt and movement wise, you'll love this game as well\nThe air rifle is pretty hany and I feel really cool to have. I just started getting into the Assassin hunting mechanics which are actually really fun. If you played the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer portion, you will feel at home as you have a compass whenever you are going up against assassins in which the compass will start to fill up whenevr you are close to an Assassin. You also however can be stalked by the assassins and actually do have to pay attention more than usual.\nSo if you read in the community hub, you can see that a lot of people are reporting on great optimization. That may or may not be true however. This game looks nice but is hardly current gen graphics. The graphics are definitely not as high quality as Black Flag and may be in between or on par with Assassin's Creed III. The hair and textures do not look very realistic at all and detract if you look long enough at them, although you really only notice this during cutscenes. Another major complaint is the lack of antialiasing options as Ubisoft only gave FXAA, despite having MSAA and TXAA in both Assassin's Creed Unity and in Black Flag. While the game does run nicely, I would appreciate it if I could make lines less jaggy with better AA tools. Character Animations are smooth and cool to watch as you get to watch and appreciate how Assassins move and kill in this game more than before. Another big selling point about this game is again how little hardware it takes to run as I can max it out on my laptop which as an intel i7-4710hq @ 2.5ghz (3.5 turboboost) and an GTX 860m 2gb graphics card.\nA great addition to the game is the music, as I loved Black Flag and Assassin's Creed II's soundtracks. The only bad thing I've heard music wise is just recycled sea shanties from Black Flag. I found it so great that they made a new updated version of the Assassin's Creed II song \"Ezio's Family\" (btw one of my fav songs from that game) for the title sreens and it sounds great. I also just like listening to the background music while playing, osmething I did not really remember or enjoy from both Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed III.\nOverall I would recommend getting this game for now as it definitely is polished for PC and I have had no bugs yet. The voice acting is great and the characters aren't simply cutouts or meaningless cameos. The gameplay is as tight and fluid as ACIV but for sure not as pretty looking as ACIV. You also should not have any trouble running this game as it works well and is easily maxed.\nI just finished the assassin part of th story and wow, it was amazing. I felt real emotion and understanding towards Shay and really am excited for my days as a Templar.", "hours": 27.0, "user_id": "76561198029975814", "username": "Absolute Ego Riot", "products": 161, "found_funny": 9, "early_access": false}

That is a bit disapointing because alot of the game is in these environements and hiding in shrubs that look like paper pop ups. Good thing the a good chunk of the game is played in the water as well, which looks great. The icey conditions add something new to the mix.\nSo far the gameplay is same old same old. Fun if you like it. Parkour still messes up and causes frustration... But that's also same old same old.\nFirst edit: few hours in. Same ol' same ol with the missions. The story is good enough and the environment is pretty varied and is actually growing on me graphically. If you are a big Assassin's creed fan, I recommend, if not, wait until a sale.\nActually, everyone just wait until a sale.\n(It runs so much smoother than past games.

I am playing this on a laptop with a GeForce 860M and I am maintaining a very steady 60fps on High/meduim graphics with 1080 resolution. As of now the story is pretty great, especially if you played the other AC games. There are cameos of a bunch of old characters like Adewale and Achilles. So far, the game is shaping up to be pretty awesome. So, if you like AC games (especially AC 4- Black Flag), then you shoud definately keep your eye on this game. (It shows promise for better obtimization from Ubisoft in the future. . . hopefully lol)\nEdit:\nUpon playing more of Rogue I have come across a few issues that I think I should address. All of these have only happened once, so don't panic. I got stuck in a loading screen when transitioning between to areas (it just did not finish loading - it sounded like it did but I had to restart the game to fix it). I also loaded in once and could not move. This one might just be a problem with my laptop, but if not I thought I should mention it.\nNevertheless, the story is even more intriguing as it progresses and the gameplay, though mostly the same as Black Flag's, has its own elements that make it stand out as its own game (i.e. avoiding assassins trying to assassinate you, etc...)\nEdit:\nI just wanted to mention that I did bring my graphics up a bit and I still maintain about 60 fps (once in a while it drops to 50, but that is during really intense battles). But there was one time during the story when I was taking down a man-o-war that my fps dropped to like 35ish, not unplayable but definately noticeable. Besides this, the story is coming along nicely, and I am curious to see how it will end.\nStory Completion:\nI have to say that this is an overall good game. I did experience a few bugs, all of which are mentioned above, but only a few. The story did feel a little on the short side compared to Black Flag, but it was still a decent length (about 9ish hours I'd say). Shay is a cool character and this game really ties all of the other ones together (even Liberation).
