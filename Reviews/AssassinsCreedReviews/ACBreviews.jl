Freerunning should be the main way of travelling in game, but it rapidly becomes frustating enough to just choose to just walk or run like a normal person.\nThe combat system is too stupid, every enemy has a specific tecnique they're weak to, there's no skill involved, no finesse, no acrobatics, no use of the enviroment, enemies don't adapt to your tactics and it all becomes boring too fast.\nStealth mechanics are the same, just a repetition of the same set of simple challenges over and over.\nThe story is very poor, characters are flat and their voice acting is just plain stereotyped and racist. There's no real story progression up till the very end of the game, because there's no real story to tell, just a bunch of nonsense conspiracy theory that you would find in a creepypasta.\nAC Brotherhood finale was particularly broken. A writer doesn't do what they've done without properly building the characters and their relationship first, and then such a finale makes sense.\nAnd all those colectibles, challenges and side missions are pointless, pointless as in there's no actual value in them, no reason to do them, they are not fun, they don't really add nothing to the storytelling, just more useless grind.\nAnd seriously...

It does make some missions more interesting.\n+Addition of killstreaks that allow you to instakill people if you manage to maintain your streak. Quite fun when you get surrounded by tons of guards from all sides.\n+Cristina's story\n+Ability to hotkey the weapons/items you use the most.\n+The pistol targets faster, making it actually useful.\n+Getting to ride a horse in town and battling on horseback was a nice addition.\n+It's nice to be able to summon assassin backup mid-battle.\n+Eagle Vision would mark any collectibles on the map. Nice when you're in the middle of a mission and don't want to take a detour. And you can buy a map if you don't want to spend too much time on hunting down the hundred flags.\n+Melee weapons are now paired with ranged weapons.\n+Crossbow and poison darts added some tactical options for some form of stealth in the game. Especially useful in memories where you had to avoid detection.\n+Addition of lifts as a quick way to get on a roof.\n+Some things to do in the present day as well, albeit not too much.\nSome things I didn't like:\n-uPlay\n-The story is shorter and interested me less than the previous game\n-The numerous Borgia towers you had to destroy to unlock shops in the city were more of a repetitive nuisance than an interesting activity. Each tower was basically the same thing - find a specific character, kill him, and climb a tower to light it. Once or twice is fine, but twelve was a bit much. Especially since most of the viewpoints in this game were those very towers.\n-You can select your fast travel destination through the map on the fast travel window. Instead, you have to go through a list of place names until the location you want to travel to lights up. Kinda unnecessarily annoying.\n-No ability to replay from checkpoint. If you screw up with the optional objective for a mission, you have to restart the entire thing from scratch. It may not be a problem for most missions, but some require going through some annoying cinematics and other time wasting segments.\n-Purchasing landmarks. I'm honestly not sure what point that serves. The pay from landmarks is very negligible (especially compared to how much you invest in them) and it doesn't change anything about the landmark. I'd understand if the payment would restore the landmark to some extent or something, but as it is, it's just something you can dump your extra money on.\n-The store investment. I'd understand if you could invest as much money as you liked in as many stores as you wanted, but you can only invest in one store at a time (until you receive income from the stores you renovated) and could only invest a designated amount of money. So, not much you can do with it.\n-You can loot some random stuff from bodies and chests, but there's nothing really you can do with the stuff, other than completing a couple of shop quests or just selling the stuff off. Kind of an underused system.\nTo be honest, while Brotherhood was a nice game, I didn't feel as into it as ACII. I'd still recommend playing it, but I'm not sure if I'd personally be ineterested in replaying it one day.", "hours": 52.5, "username": "gsimenas", "products": 62, "early_access": false}

I couldn't control my flying and i tried fixing it for an hour. Then found out that the problem was because of my G-Sync monitor, turned the G-Sync and it worked.\nOne thing i found to be fun is to recruit assassins, put them on contracts, level them up and call them for help.\nBut then i realized that even that is just kinda waste of time. You just do the contracts for the money, then you just buy more stores, more contracts, more stores etc.\nMaybe buy some new weapons which doesn't feel to impact the game very much.\nCombat is made very easy because of the counter attack, so that's that. Cool first, but just boring after couple hours.\nCharacters are just plain boring and have not much characteristics, the only character which i found to be funny is Bartolomeo d'Alviano.

My opinion of AC2 Brotherhood is tinged by the technical issues I've had with the game and with some gameplay issues.\nTechnical first - starting with the longstanding issues. When I bought the game it locked me out of AC2 which would fail at launching uplay - an issue Ubi support swore blind wasn't caused by Uplay DRM. I eventually gave up contacting them after around 4 months or so as it started to seem more like busywork rather than actually resolving the issue. Eventually a patch came out after a few years which magically (and silently) resolved the issue.\nI have always had to launch the game multiple times so the game will accept keyboard input.\nMultiplayer never really worked on OSX - and it seems Ubisoft decided it wasn't worth the hassle of fixing  hence the large notice saying MP isn't supported on mac.\nThe combination of the above led me to never buy any Ubisoft game since.\nNewer issues (which I expect will get no fixes from the devs due to the game's age and lack of interest in the platform) - the uplay app has an opaque white overlay, essentially obscuring the single means of launching the game.\nIt's still functional - you just have to memorise the button positions as the overlay flickers to life or launch the game from MP which bypasses Uplay altogether. This latter is actually faster than going through Uplay - which underlines how important tethering the game to Uplay actually is for user experience.\nFinally on OSX 10.13.1 the game freezes for reasons I've yet to figure out. So if you are contemplating buying the game for the first time - be aware you may only get to play it in bursts of 5-10 minutes.\nAs to gameplay, at its best its enormously fun. While combat is kind of reliant on block and counter and the kill streaks have always given me a Dance Dance Revolution meets QTE vibe which I never quite liked, there is some variety there if you look for it.\nMy niggles with the gameplay though:\nWith hindsight taking the route of collectables/feathers/flags to pad any claims of \"XX hours of playtime\" trend started with AC but I gather it is a staple of Ubisoft open world games. The biggest AC2 B peeve however the control schemes are messed around to make things more difficult in certain, non skippable, timer critical, missions. This is something that gets hammered into budding game devs as a major no-no - don't spend time encouraging and rewarding players for using your control system, then whip the rug out from under them unless you really want to\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665them off. This isn't a \"git gud\" issue, I completed the missions but I despised and resented the game for punishing me for being good at the game's, up to then, control system.", "hours": 79.5, "username": "Calico-Jack", "products": 106, "early_access": false}

I had a lot of fun with this, although it's not a very big part of the game.\nAlthough the game is more of the same when looking at AC2, there is definitely quite a lot more of it here. Unlike AC2, I ignored most of the side missions in this game, and just focused on the main story. The reason I skipped most of the side content though, was because there was just so much of it. If you enjoy the side activities in AC games, there's quite a lot to delve into here. However, I never really felt it was all that necessary. I only upgraded my items a few times, and was able to beat the game with low to mid tier equipment. So challenge wise I didn't feel the need to level my stuff up.\nThere is also a nice mechanic in this game, where you are \"rebuilding\" Rome by buying and refurbishing businesses, making money off of investments, etc. After a while I could afford anything in the game, but didn't really need to buy anything. Which I think is a problem AC games have in general. Unless you can offer me something really cool, or unless the equipment is really necessary, the in-game economies never make much sense.\nOn that note, something else the AC series keeps trying to do but never seems to get quite right is the player housing. I love the idea of having an Assassin's base, but there's really no reason to ever go there, and not a lot of customization options either, so I don't really feel like it became my home.\nThe story feels very much like a middle game, in that it continues the plot from AC2 but you can tell it's just filler before the third installment.\nOverall, a solid, enjoyable Assassin's Creed adventure, although much of the same as the previous game in the series.", "hours": 20.8, "user_id": "76561197995200857", "username": "mrguy0807", "products": 177, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

And let me tell you, I parted with any notion of achieving the sync the way the humanity parts its way with its past - laughing. Basically, I got Don Auditore out of the Room#1 when the timer for the entire dungeon expired.  No need for any eagle vision to see the writing was on the wall: 50% is good enough.\nI also was blown away by Ubisoft managing to cram in even more map markers for even more numerous pass-times for those who are intent on squeezing every last second of the purchase of a videogame. In sampler form those missions are not exactly bad, but Ubisoft stretched out something fierce to add Renaissance: The Monopoly  and The Roman Tycoon and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Cause in one title. So, yup, I burned a few towers, frollicked througha the Romulas\u2019 dungeons, tried to put the saved citizens to a good use and (sort of) kept up Ezio\u2019s income in-line with his (extravagant) needs.\nThis time round I said a firm \u201cno\u201d to glyphs and everything else.\nMeanwhile, what propelled the game past the AC2 to my second favorite installment in the franchise so far (that\u2019s AC1>AC2:B>AC2 for extra-clarity) was the most cohesive story and absolutely the best villain so far.\nYes, AC2:B regains what AC2 lost - its focus. Granted, it\u2019s not the same focus as in the AC1. The Ancient and Noble Order of the Assassins now reminds Free Masons even more so & Altair still remains as the only qualifying Assassin in the franchise (save for that one secondary character called Mickelotto). But it is a focus nonetheless.\nUbisoft could not have picked a better focus. I doubt that any of the subsequent games beats AC2:B in that respect.\nBecause it's Cesare Borgia! HELLS YES!\n500 years of bad publicity, and the unflattering portrayal in a videogame (that alone would have destroyed any lesser man, I wager) done zip to contain Cesare\u2019s raw appeal and wow factor. The sheer awesomeness of chasing after Cesare smoothed out many cases of having to watch Don Ezio doing idiotic things. Carrying yelling Lucretia all over the Castlo Di Angelo instead of finishing her off and taking the key takes the cake & I guess it was so appealing to Ezio, he had to do it again with a naked guy by Coliseum - by all rights, if Assassins are a force of good, evil deserves to win, \u2018cause good is so dumb.\nAnyway, yes, yes, yes, they did it right to focus on Cesare and keep showing him throughout the game as Ezio\u2019s nemesis. Loved that!\nI found controls in AC2:B the most stubborn and sluggish, and was disappointed that the only solo thing I can do in the MP module is an intro mission. I thought \u201ceverything is permitted\u201d extended as far as letting a fool to get into an MP mission on her own and die whenever. But, well, as bare-bones as Intro mission is, playing a girl-assassin was fun!\nThe modern-day stuff was as bizarre and boring for me as ever despite the injection of parkour - but I know there are good folk out there who serioulsy love Mr.Dull and Miss Lucy, so yeah, the game had some of that too and the modern storyline ended up on a cliffhanger.", "hours": 21.4, "user_id": "76561198373008989", "username": "Carefull", "products": 19, "early_access": false}

Literally Ezio becomes a leader, a mentor in front of our eyes and we share a bit of this path as we controlling him and making up the decisions. The view of Rome is amazing and the little hidden secrets giving a great blast upon completing and collecting the rewards for it.\nLore wise we not get that much more then earlier games but the story continues on an unexcepted and very shocking way makes you want to learn more and fast jump on the next game.\nI had here and there small frustration on the controls and targetting but nothing I could not bypass.

Could it better the excellent ACII despite such a short time in between games? This is what I think of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.\nAmazingly, it did just that in a number of areas. I always used to tell friends that they could be released every year if they maintained the quality and Brotherhood was the first of many to back up that statement.  The graphics quality is a step up from ACII, with excellent character models and colour palettes. The city of Rome and the other areas throughout Italy you briefly visit are beautiful, as always. Jesper Kyd also returns with another enchanting soundtrack. Much improved. on all counts.\nThe story picks up right after ACII's cliffhanger ending, allowing us to play once again in Ezio's shoes. The story also forges ahead in the present day, with Desmond and company once again on the run from the Templars. Before establishing a new hideout, you get to play a decent sized section as Desmond, which was excellent. The back and forth between him and Lucy in particular is great. You also get to explore the area around the hideout whenever you like, as well as talk to the others a little more than in ACII. I liked that a lot.\nEzio's story starts with a bang, as the Borgia attack and the game introduces you to the new big bad in Renaissance Italy: Cesare Borgia, son of last year's villain. Ezio, wounded and holding a grudge, rides for Rome to exact revenge and rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood. It is a terrific story, with some memorable missions such as infiltrating the Castel Sant Angelo to rescue an ally. It was uneven in places, however, and I didn't enjoy it quite as much as ACII's story but when it hits its stride it is a great tale. Cesare is excellent in the game, generally stealing the show and being a more unpredictable and unhinged opponent than his father, who surprisingly takes a back seat here.\nGameplay is where the game improves the most. Brotherhood continues to include more variety in its mission design, with many different missions, side missions and things to do in the city that it can be a little overwhelming to begin with. This time around, after taking down Borgia towers around the city, you can renovate much of the city in a bigger slightly silly version of Monterrigioni in the last title. You now have a lot more to spend your florins on, which is great to see. Tombs make a welcome return, this time tasking you with retrieving keys to the Armour of Romulus, a nifty looking Roman set. As before, these are some of the best missions in the game. There is also a new feature that tasks you with optional challenges during every mission, something that would remain in the series in every entry after. It's a great idea and mixes things up during missions.\nIn this game, you are tasked with rebuilding the Brotherhood in order to take the offensive against the Borgia. This is a fantastic addition, allowing you to liberate certain citizens of Rome and enlist them in your Brotherhood, sending them all across Europe on missions to level them up and gain new equipment. They play a big part in the game, allowing you to call upon them at any time to clear out guards and cause distractions to enable you to remain undetected. Sadly, once they are leveled up there isn't much incentive to keep sending them on missions and you soon forget that particular part of the game. A great new feature if slightly overpowered.\nSome old faces return in this one, including your uncle Mario, Caterina Sforza, Machiavelli, La Volpe, Bartolomeo D'Alviano and of course, Leo Da Vinci. All have slightly better models than last time, especially Caterina. She's excellent when she's in the game. A sad miss however is Da Vinci. He plays a much smaller role in this one and the game is poorer for it, in my opinion. He was one of the shining lights of the last game. The friendship between him and Ezio was downplayed this time around. The DLC, The Da Vinci Disappearance, is excellent and there's some great dialogue between the two at the end but again, you don't actually see the man himself that much. A pity.\nOther things I liked was some expanded weaponry and customization. You have much more control of the dyes you can use on your clothes, and they all look excellent. The crossbow was a game changing addition and really helped make stealth a more viable option. However, some of the quests were a little by the numbers in what would later become a problem in the series. As said above, the story also wasn't as strong this time around, despite some great moments, missions and characters.\nIn all, Brotherhood is a fantastic game, and is better in many ways than ACII. There's almost too much to cover, and it's packed full of content to sink your teeth into. Brotherhood is a very slick experience, and one of the best AC games in the series. Step back into Renaissance Italy and you will have a great time. Don't miss out on this one.", "hours": 51.1, "username": "Cassynder", "products": 1748, "early_access": false}

I really enjoyed this installment of the Assassin's Creed series.The game does a great job picking up where the last game left off. The gameplay mechanics are very similar, and the graphics have the same feel, which is not a bad thing. Rome looks great through the eyes of Ezio Auditore. In the previous game your entire base of operations was housed at Villa Monteriggioni which had to be upgraded and renovated. In Brotherhood you must rebuild Rome.There are some new gadgets, weapons, and abilities, but other than that, it feels a lot like AC2. There are pistols and crossbows now, giving Ezio more options to take out opponents at range. Horses can finally be taken through the city, which is extremely necessary. And there are more quick-travel options than in AC2. One of the most helpful additions is the execution kill streak.\u00a0Through his travels, Ezio has become quite the Master Assassin, and must begin training new recruits. You can choose to assist certain citizens throughout the city and recruit them to your cause, training them to become part of the Assassin\u2019s Guild. When you have trainees, you can call on them to take out targets or assist you in battle. All it takes is a full Assassin\u2019s bar, and a nifty little eagle whistle.Assassin\u2019s tombs have been replaced by Romulus Lairs.\nSoundtrack of this is insane and very heart touching.\nUbisoft did an awesome job on Brotherhood.

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 15, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-11-13", "text": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a bumpy horseback ride through the beautiful wilds of Roma.\nFeaturing a dual narrative, Brotherhood follows the story of Ezio Auditore in 16th century Rome.  Ezio is a veteran Assassin, a secretive order of highly trained killers who have taken up the mantle of safeguarding the free will of humanity.  They oppose the Templars, another secretive faction who dig their claws deep into the religious and governmental institutions of society; trying to impose order on what they view to be lost people prone to pain and suffering.  Yet graver threats loom on the horizon as well.  A recording from Minerva, a god-like woman resembling the stories of old, claims that she and her people ruled over humanity in an age so ancient that even time has forgotten them.  She warns that in that era, the sun erupted and decimated almost all life on the planet; humans and her own kind alike, and that it would happen again.  She eerily conveys this warning not to 16th century Ezio, but to Desmond Miles through Ezio; a 21st century Assassin reliving his ancestor Ezio's memories with the help of a machine known as an Animus.  Desmond is searching through Ezio's time in Rome during his conflict with the Borgia family for control of the city.  At some point, Ezio acquired and then hid an Apple of Eden, a piece of technology from Minvera's time, and Desmond needs it to ward off the coming eruption.\nPitted against the brutal but cunning Cesare Borgia and his grip on Rome, Ezio must bring together his fellow Assassins and recruit new members to grow his operation.  The narrative starts off incredibly strong, but becomes heavily unfocused for the greater middle of it as Ezio runs what are essentially errands to earn the favor of his companions.  Several aggravating run-ins with what should have ended with Cesare's assassination but don't; only worsen these problems, and the ending on Ezio's side of things wraps up in a shotgun blast of fast fowards and confusion.  Desmond's ending, on the other hand, feels very deserved and was a genuinely magical moment even if it slapped me with a cliff-hanger.\nDon't touch the corrupted Da Vinci memory until after completing Sequence 07.  It's completely out of order with the the rest of the story and spoils it.\nBrotherhood is a third person action adventure with a unqiue free-running mechanic that allows Ezio and Desmond to scale walls, leap rooftops, dive into haystacks, and more.  Combat with swords, hammers, and other weapons is sometimes clumsy and far, far too easy.  Succesfully executing or counter-killing an opponent allows Ezio to move from target to target and instantly kill each, one at time.  Enemies can attack in an attempt to interrupt this chain, but only ever do so one at a time and can themselves be folded into the chain by countering.  Underneath all of the stabbing and climbing is a pseudo-management game.  Rome has been left in disrepair by the Borgia's neglect and excess.  Ezio can use money he collects to renovate shops, faction buildings, transportation, and even cultural landmarks.  These renovations each feed small amounts of coin into his bank account every so often.  The more you repair; the more interest you earn on top of other benefits.  The open world of Roma is massive, spanning all the way from the papal residence of the Vatican to the rolling Roman countryside with the Tiber river and central city in between.  Flashbacks and special missions also take you outside of Rome to Florence, Venice, and more.  A horse can be summoned anywhere at any time for faster transport, and renovated sewer tunnels can be used for instant travel.  Players also manage the Brotherhood by recruiting candidates and sending them on missions across the Mediterranean to bring back money and other items as they learn the ropes along the way.  This management doesn't add up to much more than a bit of a distraction, and while being able to call on your Assassins to wipe out the enemies around you in a fight is very cool; it only makes the easy combat even easier.  Hundreds of collectible flags, treasure chests, and feathers dot the landscape and offer their own rewards.  Your willingness to track them down will depend on your tolerance for video games turning into busy work.\nRoma is absolutely gorgeous to behold.  The city extends off into the horizon with standout structures like the legendary Collosseum tower above the bustling streets.  Rocky cliffs and ancient ruins dot the lush fields in the surrounding.  16th century Italian artwork and architecture blends with original Roman design to make for a unique setting.  The music ranges from excellent tracks I'll be taking with me on the go to more oppressive but perfectly fitting ambient synths, strings, and vocals to set the mood.  Main character design is in top form and although polygons often stand out, textures are relatively distinct and readable.  The actors deserve credit as well.  Cesare Borgia in particular is brought to life with extreme aggresion, conceit, and dominance.  Pop-in and LOD swap outs can often be an issue, but have been cleverly masked by either the simple rolling hills in the distance or the thick crowds blocking your view.  You'll certainly notice it, but often times it'll slip right past you as well.  Over all, the game is very well constructed.", "hours": 46.1, "user_id": "76561198004162646", "username": "connordavisj", "products": 424, "early_access": false}

The general atmosphere, playstyle, and combat is very similar to its predecessor but several improvements have been made.  The keyboard and mouse controls are clearer to use; if you need to press Shift for a certain action the in-game text tells you to hit \"Shift\" instead of a symbol or a controller button.  There is now fast travel available and you can call a horse at nearly any time to improve movement speed.  The game is, for the most part, limited to one city, so these waypoints are greatly appreciated.\nAC:B also introduces several new systems that could be considered meta-games.  First, is rebuilding Rome.  Instead of having all of the shops immediately available, you need to invest in openning shuttered stores.  These investments do pay  you back via a bank.  It's a little  tiresome, but indicates progression.  There is also the management of your fellow assassins.  You can send them out on missions to train and return with money/items.  The items system is not well developed.  The assassins can be called out to assist you during the game, as well.  It adds new approaches to completing missions.\nThere are now also optional objectives during most memories.  Some are entertaining and encourage alternate playstyles (kill X by throwing him into a destructible object).  Others can be tiresome or repetitive (finish memory in X minutes, do not take damage, etc.).  I felt they reduced the immersion; playing a memory repeatedly to accomplish the secondary objective.\nVehicle combat is pretty terrible, as it was in AC2.  Controls are awkward and hit boxes seem amiss.  I experienced one to-desktop crash over the course of 26 hours of playtime.  I skipped some of the secondary objectives and did not attempt to complete the collecible portions of the game.\nOverall, it's a reasonable improvement over AC2.  Some people will like the additions that AC:B brings, but the game does not force you to use them.

Of the 2 AC games I have played so far in the series (AC2/AC:B), I would say I enjoy this one the most. A lot of the issues that frustrated me with AC2 have either been fixed, updated, or streamlined into more modern mechanics.\nControls: Probably the actual reason I stopped playing AC2 years ago on the Xbox 360. Its just so annoying to have your characer do something that you were not trying to make them do, then usually it will result in your death and having to redo missions over and over. I am glad to say the controls have been greatly improved. I found myself swearing at Ezio at least 95% less than what I did in AC2. There is definitely a few moments where I was angry, but overall the controls have improved vastly.\nStory: I felt as if the story was probably the weakest part. It was interesting in the first hour how it picks up directly after AC2 and introduces the antagonist. However, after that I felt as if nothing was terribly significant. Near the end the story went from like 0 to 60 where suddenly theres a war going on and I have no idea whats happening. I was disappointed by how the game just skipped 6 years and BAM, last mission. The Desmond finale was much better than the Ezio ending.\nOverall, I would recommend this game, I enjoyed it more than AC2 and it continues to build on the story. I'd give it a solid 7/7.5.

Why? Well, mainly because there are so many assets recycled from AC2 in this game; like sound effects, music, animations and menu designs. This game is basically AC2 which a few things added. And that's not cool. AC2 is a good game but we need a refreshing experience here with original assets. This ain't it. Spend the time and money to make a quality title, guys. Come on.\nCombat seems less-responsive too. The addition of being able to chain one-hit kills in combat is a nice addition, but the klunkiness kills it.

Very ocassionally it would glitch out in one way or another (e.g not grab onto a platform right in front of me) but it was rare enough to not really hamper my experience.\nThe tutorials in this game aren't just intrusive, they're obnoxious. In the penultimate mission, there is a sequence where the game prompts you to \"find a way out of [the area you're in]\". The camera then literally pans to where you're supposed to go. I'm not really \"finding\" a way out here, am I? I'd like to think that by the second-to-last mission of the entire game, a player would be prepared for some sort of challenge. By the end of the game, I was still getting prompts for keybindings for basic movement in combat and platforming, too. It's outrageous.\nThis incessant handholding extends to the combat as well. Not once did I die during my playthrough, and I only got close on one occassion. The combat consists of you locking on to an enemy, waiting for him to attack, then pressing LMB. Then if there are other enemies, press LMB on them as well (no need to wait for them to attack, now you've started a \"combo\"). Some enemy types try to spice it up by forcing you to press space to kick them before you can attack them, and it becomes more of an annoying hurdle than an actual challenge.\nMaybe this hand-holding would be forgiveable, if there was no filler and the game was short but sweet. But most of the \"story\" missions in this game are boring \"go here, do that, tail this guy\" missions. The best missions were ones where you had to stay undetected, carefully plotting out a route past the guards, which does shine a light on how awful the combat system is.\nSpeaking of staying undetected, for a game that sells itself as a stealth title, stealth is barely ever the best option. Wherever the game lets you attack head-on, its the best option. Staying undetected takes longer and has a higher risk associated with it.\nDespite all these gaping flaws, the game was a pretty enjoyable experience. The story, whilst I didn't get particularly attatched to any character, was somewhat interesting and while the game ends on a \"ooh, buy the next game to find out what happens next\" cliffhanger, they at least put the effort in to make you genuinely want to find out what happens next - and the platforming, when the game wasnt holding your hand with it, was satisfying and surprisingly well-programmed.\n6/10", "hours": 19.2, "user_id": "76561198425965561", "username": "AdHomiless", "products": 4, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 21, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-09-24", "text": "Another very good installment from Ubisoft. While I don't think it quite lives up to its predecessor, it was still enjoyable to play.\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\nGameplay and Controls 6/10:  Same as the last game, which actually was a bonus for me, considering how long it took me to get used to the controls in the first place. :p The addition of the hotkey to call on other assassin's was nice, but honestly, I hardly ever used it unless it was required by the goals of the quest I was completing or I was starting to get overwhelmed by the enemies I was fighting and needed backup. Otherwise, my fellow assassin brothers kind of stayed unused. I did like how you could send them on quests to gain more skills and liberate other areas. That I actually found very useful, especially since it improved their combat ability and made them more helpful when you did end up calling on them. I also appreciated how they retained the banking and investment system from the previous game and incorporated it more into the liberation of Rome from the influence of the Templars.\nGraphics 9/10:  I'm not sure why, but I actually felt that the graphics were a tiny step down from the previous game. The overall feel of the world was still just as rich, and it made exploring Rome incredibly fun and rewarding, but the characters and animations just seemed...off. Maybe it was a little more \"cookie cutter\" in terms of the extraneous characters? Again, I'm not entirely sure why, and I'd probably have to play AC II and Brotherhood a little bit again to pinpoint exactly what I found to be different. Either way, the graphics were still quite good, as with all of the AC games, and it really wasn't big enough of a difference to change my experience of the game.\nStoryline 7/10:  The storyline was still enjoyable, but again, not quite as good as that within AC II. I think the part I liked the most was the history behind the fictional story, which made the whole thing much more immersive. Even with that, however, this game felt much less like one cohesive story and much more like a barely strung together main story supported by numerous side quests and adventures. Whereas playing AC II was like playing through a James Michener novel, with all the rich detail and background to accompany and enhance it, this felt more like reading a short story that had lots of side stories you could read in association with it. That's possibly due to the fact that, whereas AC II covers around thirty years of history, this game only covers a few years. Either way, the story was not as well constructed, but it wasn't terrible either. It was just a little above average. I also played through The Da Vinci Disappearance DLC, and it was like an interesting short story. Even though the Copernicus Conspiracy DLC was supposedly released for PC, I've not been able to find it on my game menus or in the Ubisoft menus, so I can't speak to how good of a story that particular software addition provides.\nCharacters 7/10:  Well, Da Vinci is still great, for the little that we see of him. And of course, Ezio is his usual charismatic self, even if he's older and maybe a little grimmer than in AC II. Otherwise, the characters lacked the same depth and variety that they had in AC II. Even the villains, with the exception of Lucrezia Borgia, I found to be very cliche. All of the characters were still somewhat believable, but I didn't feel like leaping through the screen to interact with them like I did in the previous game.\nOverall Rating 8/10:  This game is a solid addition to the AC franchise. It's certainly not as strong, beautiful, nor coherent as AC II, but it's still an enjoyable game to play for the most part, and I didn't feel like I was wasting my time, even if I was just wandering around the beautiful city of Rome.

While the series has evolved a bit since this game came out, it's still a worthy experience.\n+The city of Rome is a large, detailed and beautifully rendered open world to explore, and is a really cool setting to play in. While it can be argued that it's annoyingly the only city truly explorable in the whole game, its sheer size and elaborate construction compared to the previous game's locations makes up for it.\n+The combat has been graced with a bunch of new animations and (overpowered) mechanics that, while significantly lowering the difficulty of most fights, at the very least makes them entertaining.\n+While this can easily be called a filler episode while getting away with it, the plot is still interesting and solid, following Ezio's adventures right from where ACII ended, while also expanding on the present day story as always.\n+Good longevity thanks to a decently large amount of main missions (ACII was longer, however), many sidequests and optional tasks and the Monteriggioni management mechanics from the previous game expanded unto the whole city of Rome, which by itself, along with exploration for collectibles, is quite a time-consuming task.\n+The game runs right, thankfully, and looks good enough to have aged decently even by today's standards. The Italian voice acting, my main language, is great, but i can't offer an opinion on the english dub.\n-While Brotherhood does a great job at cutting out some quirkiness from Assassin's Creed II and improves to some extent in every field, from graphics to gameplay, it's decidedly a \"more of the same\" game with the same general setting, weapons, combat system and mostly the same cast of characters too. You should not expect anything but a VERY surefire follow-up to a hugely successful game.\n-The game feels too easy most of the time. If you combo your instakill follow-up to your first kill, you can easily plow through dozens of enemies near-effortlessly, and the rest of the gameplay isn't much more challenging. It's fun, sure, but if you've played this series (or any third person melee-based game, really) you'll have a really hard time dying.\n-The side activities can get repetitive.\n-Oh, right, this is the first game in the series to feature multiplayer. But it's dead now and it never was amazing, so whatever.\nIf you liked Assassin's Creed II you will find this game a good but somewhat lazy sequel that doesn't take absolutely any risks, but rather reprises the successful formula with a few tweaks and minor additions here and there.

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 25, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-08-16", "text": "Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the sequel to the highly successful 2009 release, Assassin's Creed II. Released in 2011, two years after its predecessor, players once again take on the role of a romantic, yet badass, Italian assassin from the Renaissance era known as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. For those who have never played a game from this franchise, there's absolutely no reason to start on this installment; Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood, and Revelations are a trilogy that are best played in their original chronological order. That being said, whether you liked or disliked the prior two installments, many elements of the franchise have changed, for the better, with Brotherhood, and gamers who may have disliked the repetitve nature of the last two releases would be well advised to give this title a shot.\nWhen we last left Ezio, he had finished conquering some beautiful, well-known cities in Italy such as Venice and Florence, all the while abolishing the Templar scourge that laid within each one. In the end, his uncle Mario officially inducted him into the Assassin order, and he was last seen capturing the ever elusive Apple of Eden in a highly technologically advanced underground chamber. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up right where the last title ended, and continues onward from there. After a terrible and somewhat unexpected attack on his homestead, Ezio and his family flee from the now ruined Villa Audatorie. With his sister Claudia and mother Maria, Ezio settles in Roma (Rome), where he has the vast city at his disposal, and many exploration opportunities lay in wait; as do the Borgia, the enemy army of this title.\nWhile the last two franchise installments were seen as fairly repetitive, though to a lesser extent with the second game, Brotherhood is anything but repetitous. It's jam-packed with content, though all of it is hurled at the player from nearly the start of the game. If one doesn't feel like tackling the 9 sequence story, there are a multitude of other events to take on; memories of Ezio's first love, Cristina, Borgia towers to scale and burn down, thief missions, assassination contracts, courtesian tasks, Leonardo sequences, and so very much more. Not to mention the plethora of chests, feathers, and Borgia flags that need to be collected. While the main story lasts about 13-15 hours, players can expect a solid 30-50 if they choose to complete everything; there is absolutely no lack of content here.\nThere are also a number of series changes and franchise firsts in Brotherhood. This is the first Assassin's Creed title to introduce challenges, though they are all faction-themed for the mercenaries, theives, and courtesans. It's also the first to include 100% Synch objectives, where one must attempt to meet the extra criteria per mission to achieve a complete synchronization with Ezio. More virgin elements include the ability to replay any mission, main or not, as well as the Assassin's Guild; a somewhat mini-game where Ezio can send his army of assassins out into the field to level them up with experience points, as well as gain gold and items. Speaking of which, yes, Brotherhood is the debut of actual items that are used to complete shop quests. There are also fast travel points now, and Ezio can spend his hard-earned money rebuilding Roma by reconstructing shops, banks, stables, and purchasing historical landmarks.\nRoma is the only map players will be traversing for the entirety of their game time, and while that may sound boring, rest assured that it is not. Roma in and of itself is massive, especially when taking in to account everything that there is to do within it; let's not forget the down right incredible Armor of Romulous that can be earned by finding six scrolls, much akin to earning the Armor of Altair in Assassin's Creed II, but I digress. Gamers will absolutely need a horse to get around, and luckily there are plenty about; another series first, being able to ride a horse in town. This also means there are new, challenging enemies that ride horseback if you spark the guards' interest enough. On the topic of guards, the combat system has been revamped a little bit. Chain kills are much easier to achieve, and Ezio's new executions are as gruesome as they are fascinating.\nOn the downside, Brotherhood does little in the way of modern-day story telling; not much emphasis is placed on current-era protagonist Desmond Miles, although players are free to exit the Animus at any time before finishing the game. There's very little incentive to do so, aside from collecting a few artifacts, reading a few e-mails, and getting fed some irrelevant, uninteresting dialogue from Lucy and the gang. Where as at the end of Assassin's Creed II, there was at least a sequence to play through as a reward for sitting through the grueling amount of end-game credits, Brotherhood has nothing but a cliffhanger and a 15 minute long, unskippable credit sequence. This title also still has fairly wonky climbing mechanics, although they do seem to be a little improved over its predecessor.\nAll in all, if you hated the last two releases of the franchise, play Brotherhood; it may very well redeem the series for you with its refreshing plethora of content. If you enjoyed the last two Assassin's Creed titles, then definitely grab this installment. The villains are some of the most memorable in the entire series, the side missions are completely worth spending the time on, and Ezio is just as suave and charismatic as always. Once again, I highly recommend getting The Ezio Trilogy on console if you have one; the remastered set gives breathtaking new life to these old titles with vibrant color, better textures, and upgraded character models.\nThe Horror Network\n|\nClick for Gore", "hours": 17.2, "username": "The Horror Network", "products": 2621, "early_access": false}

AC: Brotherhood takes place RIGHT after the events of Assassin's Creed 2 (So, if you haven't played AC 2, definitely play that first) and Ezio is in search of the Apple of Eden as he attempts to save Roma from Templar control. This game's story is really good and it's a great followup to AC 2, and the twist at the beginning is great!\nSince this is a sequel to AC 2, you'll see a lot of familiar faces as you play through. Each character is great and well-written, including the main antagonist, and none of them ever feel boring. They all feel like they belong in the game. Ezio himself, like always, is fantastic. You get the sense that he's matured a lot through is journeys and you get to continue to see him grow as a character.\nThe setting as well is great and beautiful. The map is rather large, even if you don't really get to go anywhere else besides Rome. There's even flags and treasure to collect, if you're into that sort of thing. The graphics look even better than AC 2, despite there not being much time in between the two. The colors are vivid and the game runs smoothly.\nNow, onto the real reason you want this game (Well, besides for the story and Ezio). The combat system in this game is so far one of the best combat systems we've gotten in an AC game. There's not too much of a difference between AC 2's and Brotherhood's combat system, but it's still fun and satisfying (Not very challenging though saddly).\nObviously, you're going to need weapons to go into combat. You'll find a nice variety of weapons in the black smith shops, from light, sharp, and fast swords, to heavy and powerful ones, to the typically one-hit kill wrist pistol, as well as hammers, maces, and even daggers for those quick kills. Of course, you also get two hidden blades (Eventually ;) ) The weapons are all well designed and feel fantastic when using them. Also, you'll find armor in the smithing shops that will boost your resistance to attacks, as well as add more health points to Ezio.\nSince you have all of these weapons, it's time for some slicing and dicing (And we're not talking about carrots here). You'll fight an assortment of different enemies, from heavy armored powerful axe/large sword wielding dudes, to light-on-their-feet daggermen, to the basic hammer/sword dudes, pistol dudes (SO annoying), lancemen, and light armored swordsmen. So, yeah, you probably won't run out of things to stab anytime soon. Some of the enemies can be a little challenging, especially when they group up, but they're not all that difficult (And still can't swim! If they just asked Ezio for swimming lessons, maybe he'd do it). They are, however, fun to kill.\nTired of fighting bad guys alone? Well, this is Assassin's Creed BROTHERHOOD, right? Where's the Brotherhood? Well, guess what...you can now rescue civilians and train them to be assassins! Once you save civilians, you'll be able to put them to good use and train them up. You can call your men/ladies into battle and they'll take out soldiers for you. In fact, if there's not too many soldiers, you don't even have to lift a finger! Once you have enough, you can call in an arrow storm to take out some fools! Awesome! You can also send these guys on missions for you in different areas in Europe/Asia (They'll send you postcards, I'm sure of it!). On missions/contracts, they can gain more levels (max level is level 10) and even get you some much needed cash! Once they've leveled up, you can upgrade their armor or weapon, free of charge. This is a great new mechanic and thankfully made it to Revelations.\nIf you need more people for your Brotherhood, all you have to do is take out 'Borgia Towers'. These are restricted areas that are controlled by Borgia (Templar) Captains. Take out the captain, destroy the tower, and the area's yours (Along with an extra slot for another assassin in your Brotherhood!).\nWhile fighting, you might take a few hits so, you'll need to heal up. For that, you'll need some medicine (Just pop some pills, you'll be fine!). Where are you going to get this medicine though? The back alleyway? Nope. Uncle Mario's meth lab? Definitely not. You'll find different venues all over Rome that will sell you much needed supplies (including a doctor that will get you that medicine). Most of the stores are closed though so, you have to upgrade them so they're open. Doing this gives you a discount. There's a tailor, who can dye your clothes and give you storage upgrades on throwing knives, medicine, and the heavy weapon upgrade. The doctor, of course, gives you heals, medicine, and poison. There's also an art merchant, because who doesn't love some Italian art?\nIf you're looking for side quests, this game's got it! There's 'shop quests' that allow you to get the best armor (and I believe the best sword) in the game by completing them. All you have to do is find different needed materials around Rome. There's also Leonardo's Machine levels where you help destroy Leonardo's war machines he's been forced to make for the Templars. These are always fun and are usually action packed! (Do all of these and you'll get a reward ;D) There's also some other side quests scattered around, but I'll let you do the exploring. Also, DO THE CRISTINA MISSIONS!!! (BUT MAKE SURE YOU PLAY AC 2 FIRST!!!). If you're stuck on how to get the Cristina missions, they're based off of total sync. Once you reach a certain level of total sync, they will show up on the map (And a message will pop up).\nOverall, AC Brotherhood is one of the best editions to the Assassin's Creed franchise. I HIGHLY recommend getting this game, but like I said before, make sure you play Assassin's Creed 2 first!

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 28, "page_order": 9, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-07-04", "text": "The game is a decent Assassin's Creed game, but it follows the exact same formula as all early games in the series. Climb a tower, take a leap of faith, find a target to assassinate, kill them, run away, repeat. All while buying a lot of shops to upgrade your gear and collecting the infamous feathers, if you're into that. Whether you like this game depends hugely on how much you enjoyed the previous one.\nMost of the game is set in Rome at the beginning of 16th century, although some story missions show places other than Rome itself. As usual in the series, the recreation of society and historical details and information about the places, events and people of the time are a large plus if you're into history.\nThe story picks off exactly where Assassin's Creed II ended and follows Ezio Auditore da Firenze (and Desmond Miles) in their quest to find the Apple of Eden. I know that Ezio is considered by many to be the best character in the series, but I personally never grew very attached to him or his adventures. Assassins's Creed: Brotherhood did nothing to make me like any of its main characters more or less than before, maybe except Leanordo da Vinci, who is still great, but there is very little of him in this game. When it comes to the story and characters overall, I felt rather disappointed and the game failed to make me care for any of the people Ezio meets, or even for Ezio himself. It felt more like playing another hero in another action game rather than playing THAT hero in THIS game. The antagonists were not very interesting either, although it was nice to read about the real people that were represented in the game after playing it.\nThe story ends at a horrible cliffhanger, so if you do want to follow the saga of Ezio and Desmond, prepare to buy Assassin's Creed: Revelations as well. To be fair, the conclusion of this chapter of Ezio's life is there in the game, it's just obvious that there will be more adventures to come.\nThe gameplay is nearly identical to that of Assassin's Creed II. You watch Ezio climbing while holding down one button, hide among pedestrians, tail your enemies, assassinate them, and sometimes fight guards who tend to encircle you and then patiently wait for their turn to fight, forming a fight club of sorts. The combat looks good, but is very easy. Usually you wait for a right moment to block and counter-attack, and if timed correctly, you kill the enemy instantly AND the next enemy, and the next, and the next... Overall there is little challenge through the game at all. I found it a bit boring at times to be honest, although I did enjoy watching combat animations and solving occasional environmental puzzles. Building and expanding your assassin's guild (an addition in comparison to the previous game) and buying shops often felt more like a chore and in my opinion, could be entirely thrown out of the game without making it any worse. Just time-consuming elements that gave you a sense of progress in terms of money and available gear, but were just not fun to do. Kind of like real work... I'd rather collect better gear by assassinating someone in a side-mission or exploring the map for example.\nThere are a lot of weapons to use and choose from, as well as some customization options for the armor, which affects not only looks, but also health and the number of gadgets that you can take on a mission. It does give a sense of progress and makes for some variety in a game that otherwise feels rather repetitive.\nThe voice acting is done well, although the forced Italian accent... well, it can be either cringeworthy or makes for some additional immersion, it's up to you to decide. Anyway, the actors did their part well. The music on the other hand... I don't remember it. I had to re-listen to the ost composed by Jesper Kyd just for this review, and found it hard to describe. It's just so... non-emotional. Technically correct, but there is nothing in it that enhances or destroys the feeling of the game. It just... is. That is a rather big minus, since a good soundtrack can make a difference between a generic scene and a memorable adventure. In Assassin's Creeed: Brotherhood it is just there, not disturbing nor intensifying the game and after playing you don't even remember any melodies.\nWow, that was a lot of critique on my side, more than I thought I would write. Still, this is not a bad game; it's a triple-A title that offers around 20 hours of game-time, including parkour, fighting and assassinating people and solving some puzzles on a large map of renaissance Rome. In my opinion, it just simply fails to be anything more than that; yet another open-world adventure game that doesn't stand out among its competition. And since there are a lot of games in this genre, it's just hard to go easy on this one. I recommend Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood to those who sincerely enjoyed Assassin's Creed II or those who want to play through all the major titles in the series. Others may skip it without missing much.\nVerdict: 6/10", "hours": 0.1, "username": "Silvervarg", "products": 268, "early_access": false}

I say that because in 2017 I cannot recommend this game because of the plethora of bugs and crashes I faced during my playthrough. I am playing on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and whether or not it is different on other operating systems is of no consequence since I assume the majority of people will be playing this on that platform and that eventually the majority of people will be using that operating system.\nDuring my playthough, I had three crashes. The most distinct of which happened during a Follower of Rommulus mission where textures dissappeared and a majority of Ezio's clothes disappeared. The other two happened at random during the playthough. However, it was the continuous amount of bugs that happened throughout that were more cumbersome. Various missions do not progressing because of vsync not being on (Leonardo flying mission, assassination mission, story sequences, etc.), several missions would not even allow for success since enemies could not be defeated and many times I feel into false holes that I could not get out. All of these detracted from the game since you had no idea when they were  going to happen and you had to be hypervigilant to do everything perfectly not to fall into something or on something that would permenatly stick you. With these problems alone I cannot recommend the game. Oddly Ubisoft updates the files through Uplay (happened twice) although it seems only to plug their other projects in the crawl on the opening menu.\nAlthough I will list some concrete postivies and negatives that I found about the game.\nPositives:\nMore Assassin's Creed 2 like gameplay\nHaving assassin's to call upon is pretty cool\nNegatives:\nFast Travel is useless since the points are not labeled on the regular map\nAssassin Trainnee program is tedious\nAnticlimatic follow-up from Assassin's Creed 2", "hours": 31.4, "user_id": "76561198026657379", "username": "Reverus", "products": 72, "early_access": false}

But he can\u2019t take down the corrupt Knights Templars\u2019 agents, the Borgias, alone; he must enlist help. He must establish a Brotherhood, one that will strike fear in the agents of evil and bring peace and tranquility to the known world.\nThis is a very worthy sequel to the second Assassin\u2019s Creed (\u201cAC2\u201d), which followed Ezio on his quest to get revenge against the Templars for the death and trauma caused in his family. At the very end after sparing Rodrigo Borgia (who had become Pope Alexander VI through his Templar connections and overpowering charisma), Ezio was given a revelation by a strange, godlike being called Minerva, who told him that humanity was created by her race; there was a cataclysm long in the past and it would happen again in the future. Whether that has anything to do with the story of the current game has yet to be determined.\nWhat is clear is that you spend a lot more time in the present (2012) in this installment. Desmond, the \u201creal\u201d protagonist; Lucy, his savior and close friend and ally; Rebecca, the techie of the group; and Shaun, the historian with a rather dry sense of humor, find themselves in the ruins of Monteriggione, the Auditore villa, where they set up shop to look for clues to the lost Apple of Eden (an ancient mind-controlling device). Desmond finds himself hallucinating ghosts as the genetic memories he experiences in the Animus come to him as he\u2019s up and about. And Ezio himself has a much more sprawling quest this time around\u2026\nHe finds himself in Rome, tracking down the orchestrator of the assault on his villa, Cesare Borgia. The Borgias\u2019 influence in Italy\u2019s great city knows few bounds, with their guards nearly full-time on the alert for the escaped assassin in their midst. Fortunately, you can ignite their towers throughout the city to reduce their influence, and buy and renovate shops and other amenities throughout the city much like you did in Monteriggione in AC2.\nThis is a MASSIVE game, and a highly enjoyable one too! The story is still very convoluted and filled with historical references \u2013 for instance, the ultimate cynic and power-player, Machiavelli, makes a much larger showing in this game, and Leonardo da Vinci returns with more fascinating (and dangerous) inventions. Completing missions in certain ways will bring forth Ezio\u2019s repressed memories, which serve as a sort of prequel to the previous game, as Ezio tracks down his crush, the beautiful Cristina, and tangles with his rival/enemy, Vieri\u2019 Pazzi. And there is a mysterious yet extremely hostile faction, the Followers of Romulus (the mythical founder of Rome who was raised by wolves), who wear wolf skins and helmets and attack ferociously like their inspiration; but they are the stewards of wondrously protective armor\u2026\nThere are so many new side-quests and diversions to try in this game; but then, Rome is a huge city, three times as big as Florence from AC2. But when you\u2019re through (temporarily, to be sure) traipsing through Rome, the multiplayer, new to the series, will test your mettle against your fellow man (the rather surprising back story here being that you play the bad guys: a Templar in virtual training against other Templars). In the several modes, you are given a target (another player) while simultaneously being targeted. Your prey can\u2019t see you unless you run close to him; an indicator shows when you\u2019re close, and extra points are awarded for stealth, ranged kills and averting attacks from your own pursuers.\nAll in all, an excellent game; one you can spend hours losing yourself in.

The combat is faster and with the ability to chain combos together you don't have to spend a half hour per fight trying to take down the baddies.\nThe controls are still frustrating and the character movement still infuriating when you are in a hurry..not to mention the horse pathing is absurd (randomly slows down and can jump a fence yet not a 1 foot high rock)\nAbout half way through I was happy that I was finally enjoying this series and loving the improved combat when I learned of the abillity to recruit and train fellow assassins to aid you throughout the game. VERY COOL FEATURE.\nNow for the main downside to this game...I would argue that about 60% of the time or even more you have no creativity in your missions. It seems like you almost always have some restrictions present. The missions are always either forcing you to keep from being detected or forcing you into a major fight you would rather avoid or some other such nonsense. Then of course there are entirely TOO MANY timed missions.

Do you remember the tailing missions in Assassin's Creed 2 when you followed the Spaniard and his co-conspirators in Venice or Jacopo in Tuscany? Those were great examples of tailing missions done right. You had to follow the target without being seen while overcoming obstacles on the way, be it tall buildings or guards blocking the road and the game gave you the tools to overcome these obstacles the way you saw fit. Courtesans, mercenaries, throwing knifes, ect. And plot was happening! Important information was given to you as you eavesdropped on your targets that was relevant to the main story. They were interesting to play. In this game that all changed in the name of padding. You follow your excruciatingly slow and mute target through open ground, completely unopposed until you're so bored out of your mind you just want to end it all. And not only the main missions but several side missions are also like this. The missions that are supposed to provide a distraction and variety from the main story consists of boring filler.\n\nThis game has a lot of filler missions like that along with re-used assets from Assassins Creed 2 since Ubisoft decided to make a new installment in the series every year at this point. The game and the series itself has suffered from this in my opinion, in more ways than one. From the story feeling like it's butter scraped over too much bread to sloppy polish. A lot of graphical glitches happen during combat such as NPC's fighting each other through walls, Ezio doing execution animations in mid air and when you do leaping hidden blade assassinations a lot of the time he stabs the air next to the target's head, something that never happened in the first and second game. It's obvious to me that they worked on making new animations to make the game feel fresh but didn't have the time to polish it enough to make it look good or even work properly.\n\nAnother annoying aspect is that some times being discovered causes desynchronization. That's ok in itself but it also counts if a guard spots you milliseconds before you kill them. This led to a lot of unnecessary frustration that shouldn't be there in this type of game, especially in the da Vinci missions where if it happened you were forced to restart the checkpoint. This happens in the main story missions as well, even if you kill the target, if he notices you just for a millisecond it counts as being spotted and you're sent back to the nearest checkpoint. This is unnecessary and frustrating. You have a horse to travel around faster than running but it's plagued with annoying little quirks like when you call him he goes to where you called him from, not to where you were which some times results in you having to chase him around since he runs away from you some times if you don't immediately jump on. The game also doesn't consider walls or hills when you call the horse so some times when you're next to an unclimbable hill and call him he'll appear on top of the hill where you can't get to him or behind the building next to you. It's yet another small annoyance that wouldn't have been there had they had more time to work on it.\n\nThe game also has an annoying habit of thinking it knows better where to put the camera than I do which is a real annoyance, especially during chase sequences. It's supposed to help you see where to go but all it truly does is break the flow of the chase and more often than not cause me to jump the wrong way. Games shouldn't do this unless it's a vital part of the gameplay and it's a classic case of hand-holding gone wrong. I truly hate things like this because if I want to place the camera somewhere I have good reason for it.\n\nMy favorite feature in Brotherhood is without a doubt the assassin recruitment system where you save civilians and they join your assassin order. You get to send them out on missions to gain rank and you can call them to help you when you're in combat. As of writing this review I can't think of a better implemented mini game in any of the other Assassin's Creed games than this one. The pointless trading mini game from the third one comes to mind here. In this one the mini game has an actual purpose, to train your assassins to become stronger so they'll be better at helping you in the field. I think this is the strongest asset this game has and for that and that alone I love and cherish it.", "hours": 36.0, "username": "Danny Rodriguez", "products": 190, "early_access": false}

The multiplayer in Brotherhood is AMAZING and one of the greatest things in any Assassin's Creed ever. Unfortunately, there is no playerbase anymore, so it's virtually unplayable.\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood is a noble continuation of the story of both Desmond and the Assassins & Ezio and the Assassins. The events of Brotherhood directly follow the end of Assassin's Creed 2, which has Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca, and Shaun, flee to Monteriggioni to continue Desmond's exploration in the animus while Ezio discovers that there is more he will need to do to bring a true end to the Borgia.\nLet me stop right here to say, as a player it's extremely frustrating this whole game basically exists because\nbut whatever. The story evolves into much more, especially with regard to Cesare, so it's not\n.\nAnyway, the game at its core is AC2, which is fantastic, because AC2 is a gaming masterpiece in my eyes. Brotherhood introduces some new collectibles, a few characters, and some minor game mechanics, but little else. I wrote a review on AC2 already, so if you want to get a good sense of how I feel aboutthe great aspects of this game you can read that. I had very few complaints with AC2.\nIn AC2 and Brotherhood both the visuals are great, the atmosphere is captivating, the voice acting is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, the pacing is good, the missions are fun, the combat is\nsatisfying, the collectible/side content is unique (seriously, if you don't do the collectible/side content in AC2 or Brotherhood you're missing out on one of the very best aspects of the games), and the ending is SO GOOD! I love Brotherhood for many of the same reasons I love AC2.\nHowever, I don't think Brotherhood is as good as AC2 and there are a few reasons why...\n1) The city management is boring and unnecessary. This got started with Monteriggioni in AC2 and I didn't like it then, so I didn't want it to continue. Unfortunately, it did. I like renovating the faction houses because they serve a useful purpose in the game play, but the rest to me is silly. It doesn't affect any gameplay hardly at all, and it's just something totally unnecesary and boring that they spent development time on.\n2) The same can be said about Assassin contracts. You can look at Brotherhood and see the beginning of mobile gaming bleeding into high-quality, top-tier AAA games. I remember distinctly seeing online advertisements \"send your brotherhood on missions across Europe!\" as if it was something exciting or interesting. It's not. It's boring and it's just a timesink.\nThe assassin recruits aspect is good. In many cases the missions in Brotherhood are much more difficult and Ubisoft made many of the enemies tougher, so you really need to use your assassin recruits. However, creating some type of progression system for them was unnecessary and stupid, if you ask me.\nThe assassin recruits aren't amazing though, either. Sometimes their availability makes missions WAY too easy. There is a mission where you must kill a target in less than 5 minutes for \"full synch\" but in the first 5 seconds if you hold down the button for the assasin recruits to perform an arrow storm he dies instantly.\nOn other missions you're\nto use your assassin recruits to kill your target without being detected, but often times when you do the game says you were detected and you failed the mission. So they're quite buggy and they could've used more polish.\n3) Sequences 8 and 9, all the way up until you finally leave the animus and return to Desmond, are terrible. AC2 has a drop in quality, too. Sequences 12, 13, and everything up until the Pope in sequence 14 were boring and monotonous as well. But it's still no excuse. It really feels like the devs just gave up during these sequences. The lines \"assassino! GUARDS!!!\" Live in Assassin's Creed infamy because of this game.\nAnd that's it. I know it may seem like I'm bagging on this game a lot, but I really do love it. Like I said before, the game's story, atmosphere, missions, characters, voice acting, etc. are all incredible. But given that the game is so great, I figured I'd focus on some of the reasons why I think this series (since most people reading these reviews have likely played other AC games) took a slight dip here.", "hours": 16.9, "user_id": "76561198128287463", "username": "Shiny Magikarp", "products": 155, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Interesting aspect is the assassins that you can recruit and train. But, it gets into the game little too late and at that part it does not play that important role as it could play in earlier game.

It's not bad, but you would expect little more.\nIf you like games like prince of persia or tomb raider, get it. It's a nice game.\n[Spoilers ahead and some rambling]\nOverall the game is really nice. It has some problems. During fights the camera likes to position itself in odd places, like on top of the tree. This way it gives you some extra immersion. Sometimes Ezio doesn't want to execute the leap of faith correctly and instead of landing in hay you are landing 2 meters from it and break all you bones. These are quite rare that don't really bother that much. What is bothering are missiong with french army. They are really poorly made. It's not obvious what you are suppose to do. But even that is kinda ok. You can play the mission twice, that's not a problem really. Especially that the game is really enjoyable. What is the realy bummer is the last 2 sequences and Desmond ending. Jezzz... You are given the apple. That apple forbids you from using any weapons and you have 3 missions in row to kill enemies. The apple is a purely useless weapon so you watch how your assassins and friends are killing enemies. It's purely boring. Then there is a cutscene where Ezio say in one sentence that we should never use the apple (useless weapon) and the next thing he is using the apple. Then there is a sequence where Ezio is has to go through a battle field (without the damn apple) and kill the main bad guy. That's ok.I really would like if the game would just end there, but no. Then you have some prince of persia sequence with desmond. The whole tension with Ezio is ruined by that sequence. It's actually the most boring sequence in the whole game. The ending.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes the mechanics and ideas from its predecessor, Assassin's Creed 2, and refines them. It was an amazing adventure indeed. Slowly establishing your connections throughout the city of Rome and building your Brotherhood was a fun journey. However, like every game out there, it does have some flaws associated with it.\nPros:\n+ Combat. It's been refined and been made much more fun. Ezio can shoot faster with the pistol this time around, and the execution streaks are satisfying to watch.\n+ Story: Picks up where Assassin's Creed 2 left off. We are introduced to (somewhat) good characters, and an intruguing plot.\n+ Your own Assassin's to command: This is a great addition to the game. We now have our own guild. We can call the members to aid us in combat or get them to take on contracts through which they gain experience and become more and more powerful. You can also customize them with dyes, and the skill points they earn can be allocated to upgrade the armor  and/or the weapons they possess.\n+A range of customization: A lot of weapons/armors/dyes to select from .This is always an added bonus for me.\n+Soundtrack: Oh god, the soundtrack. So god damn beautiful. ahhhhh\n+Graphics: Pretty great for its time, and still manages to hold up to this day.\nMixed:\n+/- Climbing: It feels somewhat...inaccurate. At times, Ezio would jump off the specified path and prefered suicide instead. But at times it also felt great.\n+/- World Design: I don't know why but i don't feel all that fascinated by the world's design, except for a few places/areas. But i guess that's just me. ;P\n+/- Characters: Not all that interesting too be honest. No particular attachment to anyone or rooting for anyone (except for Ezio ofc)\n+/- Awkward Color Pallete: The color pallete changes upon entering different districts of Rome. Only one of the filter looks great, the rest of the two look awkward and plain ugly.\nCons:\n-Tailing missions: For \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s sake can we please stop them. These are genuinely annoying and frustrating and have no other objective than to prolong the length of the section.\n-Optimization: I get awkward stuttering, although i can run a bunch of games easily at 60FPS. And the stuttering can be annoying.\n-Easy: The game can be genuinely easy at times.\n-Repetitive: Could get slightly repetitve at times as well.\nIn the end, the pros outweigh the cons. I highly recommend this to fans of the Assasin's Creed genre, and to everyone in general. It's an amazing experience; one that should not be missed.

Brotherhood continues the narrative of Ezio Auditore, the Master Assassin from Florence, introduced in Assassin's Creed II. As Ezio and his ally, Machiavelli are forced to relocate their guild to Roma (Rome) following persecution from the ruling party of Roma, the Borgia. Ezio continues his quest to secure the Apple of Eden and keep it from the hands of the Templars. Brotherhood has exhilirating combat, semi-fluent parkour, and a large basin of armour, melee and ranged weapons, equipment, and aesthetic colours to add to your ever-developing costume. Brotherhood introduced recruiting Assassins into the series, personally one of my favourite mechanics. Being able to send your comrades out on tasks for the Brotherhood, call them into battle to assist you, or have them rain arrows in defense of their mentor is quite appealing to the Assassin's Creed fan. You have the ability to increase your Assassin follower's armour levels by equipping them with sturdier armour upon leveling up, and equipping them with better weapons, all the while developing their skills as an Assassin. The game does encounter some relatively frequent graphical glitches and rare crash errors. Especially towards the late game, the cinematics will often not trigger or a required clause will not register as 'met', causing the need to revert to a checkpoint or restart a memory, which can sometimes be considered gamebreaking. In total, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic development in the Assassin's Creed series, which sets up the story for the fourth game, Assassin's Creed Revelations.", "hours": 24.7, "username": "Kylo Ren", "products": 182, "early_access": false}

I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, but found myself frustrated with the mechanics of this game on a regular basis. It is in many ways an improvement on ACII, the addition of assassin recruits that you can call to assist when fighting is awesome. The story is also solid, both animus and Desmond arcs, even if there aren't many targets for Ezio to kill (outside of the optional side quests). And the addition of parachutes is great as you don't nhave to worry about falling to your death when you accidently fall from the top of the Colloseum.\nHowever there in lies one of many things that are a niggle aboput this game. The movement is a back step from ACII. Oftenwhen trying to free run Ezio will either jump in the wrong direction, miss a leap of faith or sometimes just stop entirely and star hopping up and down on the spot. Add to this the you will often find that your weapon has been dissarmed and replaced with fists and in one of the Leonardo warmachine levels your vechicle stops responding to your input and this game becomes as frustrating as it is satisfying.\nI'm still going to reccomend this game as there are so many more games out there that are worse than Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which is full of redeeming qualities. That said I would advise against paying full price and look to get it when it's on sale.\n6.5/10", "hours": 75.6, "user_id": "76561198168661351", "username": "isbadiz", "products": 100, "early_access": false}

My lack of age is really showing right now, isn't it?\nYeah, I'll admit it, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an old favorite of mine. My first game for my PlayStation 3 was Assassin's Creed and this girl in my class let me borrow every subsequent AC release. I even asked her out. She said no. I'm a lonely man. Anyways, let's review this game!\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place exactly right after Assassin's Creed II, both in Desmond's and Ezio's storyline. Desmond is being hidden in a new location while the Templars keep hunting him and his Assassin gang down, while Ezio realizes the consequences of NOT killing the main villain of the last game and has to fight his much more evil and powerful son.\nThe story in Brotherhood is... alright. There are some highlights here and there like saving \"Jesus\" from being crucified, disguising yourself and your battalion as French soldiers to infiltrate a fort, and especially the final level in Spain are some real stand-outs. But the interweaving drama between these climactic moments is pretty dull. It's like Lifetime entertainment's take on what \"drama\" is. For some reason Claudia hates Ezio and La Volpe randomly doesn't trust Machiavelli. These subplots come out of nowhere and are so easily solved it makes you wonder why they were problems in the first place.\nWhile the story isn't A-grade material, what always attracted me to Brotherhood and had me replay it three times (yes, this is my third time playing this bloody game in 7 years), was Rome. This is, in my opinion, one of the best Assassin's Creed sandbox locations in their whole library. If anything even comes close to Rome, I'd say it's the Carribbean Sea from Black Flag, but that's a debate for another time and place. Rome has some real atmosphere to it.\nRome feels like a dead city with real culture that's had a new culture come by and forcibly build their own monuments and villages on top of it. The poor live in the ruins of Roman architecture while the wealthy live in their Italian villas within the main city. Rome feels very interconnected and the music that changes whenever you go to different sections of the map gives the sandbox a truly unique flow. This is one of the most alive sandboxes I've ever played in an open world game.\nOf course, a great sandbox doesn't carry a game. And, unfortunately, this is one of the greater faults of Brotherhood. As a sequel to Assassin's Creed II it doesn't do a whole lot to improve the gameplay as a new installment. You can ride horses inside cities, maintain your own brotherhood, and have a new plethera of gadgets and gizmos at your disposal... but the core gameplay isn't changed that much so the new features feel really tacked on and make the game a f***-ton easier.\nThe new counter system breaks any challenge in combat you could ever have in these games. It ranks weapons in stores like there's a difference between weight, power, and deflection but you can kill the same amount of guards in a fight with just your bare fists because of the counter system. If you kill one guard you can chain kills until everyone lies dead around you. Where's the challenge in that? Where's the fun?\nThe Brotherhood mechanic also takes away a lot of potential fun. You can now train assassins to go across the globe and perform various tasks... that you can't watch. And when they return you can have them kill your targets for you. But, again, where is the fun in that?\nThat being said, the micromanaging you do through Rome by maintaining your Brotherhood, buying out businesses and ruins, and going on various side-quests always managed to latch its talons deep into my brain. There's something about mindlessly running around and performing small tasks to accomplish a greater good that makes me forget about how mundane and terrible my own life is, and then I don't have to worry about the swirling abyss that is my inevitable death and I... oh god... no... NO! NOT AGAIN!\n*ahem* Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a precursor of what was to come to this franchise that has been slowly drained by Ubisoft to this day. They keep thinking that \"innovation\" is just \"adding some more sh** on top of the formula\" and it works in this game. Assassin's Creed II was more like the child in the front of the class that took notes and got a fair B for its great effort, while Brotherhood is sitting in the back and just follows its friend's lead by barely scraping away with a C. And that's pretty much was Brotherhood is. Good... but not as good as Assassin's Creed II. A decent experience that has lost its charm and magic it used to have over me as these years have passed. I'm giving Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood a 6/10.", "hours": 23.1, "username": "Double Uppercut", "products": 289, "found_funny": 9, "early_access": false}

AC:B organically develops both Desmond's and Ezio's arcs, introduces fresh villain (my favourite from the series), gives us new historical city to parkour in and even manages to introduce multiplayer, the first ever AC title to do that.\nEzio is now the Grand-Master of Assassins and wants to enjoy his vacation after practically single-handedly dismantling Firenze and Venice Templar cells, a journey that took 20 years of his life... all for revenge. Turns out that he\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off that ONE man he shouldn't have while doing it. Thus, series of unfortunate events will lead Ezio into the heart of once-great Roman Empire - Rome. A heart corrupted and totally under control by Templars and their new Headmaster - Cesare Borgia. But fear not, for Ezio is not alone in this fight, now he has support, manpower and resources of entire Assassin's Creed.\n+ Interesting story with unexpected turns right from the get-go\n+ More insight into Templar Order and their personal feuds\n+ Greatly improved combat (bad-*ss chain-executions, secondary weapons are finally useful mid-combat, new enemy types, crossbow - FINALLY (it was actually teased in the original AC, now we finally have it))\n+ I just have to point out the villain - Cesare Borgia (fearless, smart, cunning, has connections and has abolutely unquenchable thirst for power)\n+ Your very own team of new assassin recruits, that you can rely on when outnumbered or cornered (or when you do not desire to mess your own hands)\n+ Rome is beautiful and BIG (much bigger than Firenze and Venice combined!)\n+ MP, I guess? (not a fan of it, I like SP in my games, but it's fun and I recognize that)\n- Horse-riding could use polish\n- Tower-unlocking can get a bit tedious if done in one go (you have to assassinate district commandant in order to \"liberate\" a district)\n- Collectables might get quite overwhelming\nTo summarize, AC:B is one of the best AC games ever, with great optimization and even better graphics fidelity. Combat is a never-ending fun and stealth is sometimes hilariously easy with the crossbow and your team of assassins.

However, that is quickly shaken off and Brotherhood is a solid entry in the Ezio series. Playing as Ezio is as fun as always, possibly more so as he's got more gadgets than Batman.\nTheres quite a heavy emphasis on management, with rebuilding rome or recruiting your own assassins. I like this sort of thing, but if it doesnt set your world on fire you can pretty much ignore it once the training wheels are let loose. The graphics are good, especially considering this was released nearly 7 years ago.\nRome can sometimes feel overwhelming, with there literally being tons of stuff to do - hundreds of side objectives are available. And this is where I feel it has overstretched itself, content for the sake of content. The plot is quite thin and tends to jump around, with no real sense of flow, just a series of disconnected objectives.\nI hold my hands up and admit that I found Assasins Creed skull-crushing difficult at times, with Altair dying more times than I could count. Ezio seems almost overpowered in this game, and sometimes battles can feel a little too easy when you perform a 15-count execution streak.\nOverall, Brotherhood is an enjoyable game with possibly too much stuff in it, but saying that, I suspect I will lose a few more hours running around Rome before I'm finished with it.", "hours": 38.9, "user_id": "76561198077914319", "username": "WantedEye", "products": 112, "early_access": false}

It requires you to grind and loot and hunt for chests which takes away from the fun.\nI also didn't like the addition of random encounters, especially since they increase notoriety.

You don't mess with assassins, but you definitely don't mess with Juno.\nActual Review (no spoilers):\nAC: B improves on a lot from AC2. It's really fun, has an engaging story (with a few WTF moments), and the gameplay is MUCH better than AC2. The open world is GREAT. Worth the full price. Although I would start with AC2 because of the story.\nHaven't played the DLC (DaVinci's Dissapearance) yet, I'm planning to. Looking forward to beginning AC: Revelations and finishing AC: Black Flag!\nEDIT: Just finished the DLC (DaVinci) and before that, Revelations. The DLC was cool and had a fun addition of being able to run into people and not fall (like the later AC games). Check out my review for Revelations here:\n\nNote: I got this game for free, because I got it as a gift.\nNote 2: Some missions are annoying, but that is in all AC games and they don't really ruin the gameplay. If you're frustrated, just come back to the game in a couple of days and try that mission again with a fresh start! The game is worth finishing!\nNote 3: I wish people would start playing multiplayer again! Not this game in general, although it would be fun, but Assassin's Creed Multiplayer in general. These games include: AC: B, AC: Revelations, AC3, and AC: Black Flag. I'm not including AC: Unity, because people seem to think that that is the main multiplayer game of AC, so the rest should be ignored. That is not the case! Seriously, multiplayer deserves some respect! Otherwise, Ubisoft won't make multiplayer in their next game - AC: Empire (set in Ancient Egypt)!\nEDIT: Recently finished Revelations and I gotta say...Brotherhood is the BEST game out of the Ezio trilogy! Sure AC2 was great, but Brotherhood improved on so much and had multiplayer! Even if AC2 had the best story, it is really the blend of story, gameplay, graphics, music, etc. that makes the final cut as the best game and Brotherhood is it! Just do be sure to play AC2 for the story and gameplay, because even though it's an awesome game, you kind of won't want to go back to it after Brotherhood.\nSome people also complain that the ending (which was...WAIT I THOUGHT I TOLD MYSELF TO NOT GIVE AWAY SPOILERS? aww, but the ending is so great!!!) is a bit rushed. I'd say it seems that way, but it is much better than the ending of the previous game(s).", "hours": 87.5, "compensation": "Product received for free", "user_id": "76561198121358136", "username": "Moonstrike", "products": 68, "early_access": false}

So this thumbs down is because my laptop has an I7-4720HQ, GTX 960M 4GB, and 16GB of ram and this game has a hard time running even with all the graphical settings turned down. So poor optomization is my rationale for this rating. Both of the other games on the Ezio trilogy are running well at high-ultra settings  quite well. Even AC Rogue worked on my old laptop that had an R7 M260DX in it. So yeah, good game, tough time with the gameplay a lot of the time. Still on the lower end of playable most of the time.

Some missions have a requisite of, for exemple, not being detected by guards to achieve 100% sync and that's ok, but sometimes after a cutscene the game repositions you and puts you right in the middle of 75 guards all looking at you. Kinda hard not to be detected. I also experienced a few graphical glitches (things like a part of the roof or peoples' clothes disappearing), but I can't really say these graphical glitches were a problem to my experience playing the game.\nI've also come across a glitch in one of the last missions where the cutscene wouldn't start after I got where the game told me to go.

Riding through town, fast-travel points within the city, kill streaks, brutal new animations and mission-replayability are some of its many improvements, fixing a few negativities I found in the previous game.\nInstead of just rebuilding his family villa, Ezio is tasked with liberating a Borgia-oppressed Rome and bringing it to its former glory, with the help of not only a few old friends, but of a new Brotherhood as well. Assist citizens in need and watch them rise through your ranks, ultimately shaping Master Assassins to aid you in your quest. The main antagonist is ambitious, vicious and ruthless, stopping at nothing to achieve his goals, which, in turn, make his every appearance exciting.\nUnlike former entries, Brotherhood offers a wide variety of interesting side quests, such as excellent tombs to explore, advanced war machines to destroy and templar agents to silence, even though they mask the rather short length of the main story. Rome is filled with great sights, which help make every area feel distinct from the last, and, for the avid completionists, accomplishing eveything didn't feel as great a chore as Assassin's Creed 2 did, although the reasons for that may vary according to each player.", "hours": 35.6, "username": "Ez win", "products": 49, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It does get better with every new AC game however.\n- The player's interaction with the city has been improved a lot since AC2. Rome in ACB is a massive playground full of opportunities.\nCons:\n- There was a few glitches here and there (be sure to turn on V-Sync to fix most of them if you have a 60Hz monitor, if not, set your RR to 60Hz or cap your FPS at 60. The worst of the glitches is in Sequence 9 where you can't start a particular cutscene unless you go and ingage the guards (don't kill them) and then run past them into the objective marker. If you don't do that you can't start the next part.\n- Slightly buggy.\n- The game literally introduces stealth missions, but has either no, little or bad (and I mean atrocious) stealth mechanics. I am excellent in Splinter Cell, Thief and Hitman, because the game's mechanics allow me to be. The detection system is illogial and the AI badly programmed, considering the fact that 2005's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory had better stealth AI and it's also made by Ubisoft. The game also lacks a cover system and the ability to use diversionary tactics, such as whisling or throwing a bomb to cause a distraction.

It improves on a lot of things from AC 2 and it is overall a masterpiece in design and execution but I personally prefer AC 2 because I think the story was slightly better and I preferred Venice and Florence over Rome for the setting but I still really love Rome in this game. Just like AC 2 the recreation of the city really makes the world feel real and the attention to detail is just outstanding. The combat is much improved from AC 2 with the kill streak mechanic they added and it overall just feels more natural and free flowing. The animations are so fluid and on point it\u2019s great to look at. The way Ezio dodges each attack when he counters with the hidden blade and then just going seamlessly between enemy to enemy is masterfully done. The combat in this game is the best in the series and it slowly started going downhill after this game to the point where I started to dislike the combat by the time AC Black Flag came out. Soundtrack is beautiful and just as good as AC 2\u2019s. They added so many new little features and tweaks to the overall gameplay and design (just like AC2 did from AC1) that it feels like a whole new experience and not more of the same like the franchise ended up being called out for later.

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 60, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-10-04", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio Auditore in a single huge city (Rome) that is dotted with hills, ruins, narrow streets and platforming opportunities aplenty. The twin stories of Ezio and Desmond are some of the most effective in the Ezio trilogy. Marred by some poor keyboard & mouse platforming controls and bad implementation of v-sync, but there is controller support. If you\u2019ve enjoyed other Assassin\u2019s Creed games, this is a must-own.\nUplay is required.\nYou can\n.\nTotal size on my hard drive: 11GB\nNote: If you are new to Assassin\u2019s Creed games and wondering where to start, I\u2019d recommend Assassin\u2019s Creed II, not Brotherhood.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood picks up right where Assassin\u2019s Creed II left off: Ezio is in Rome, having just fought the previous game\u2019s final boss, and Desmond et. al. are on the run after having their hideout crashed by Abstergo. Having completed the battle in Rome, Ezio returns to Monteriggioni to have sexy times with Catarina Sforza, only to have the idyll interrupted by Cesare Borgia laying siege to the fortress. After it falls, Ezio and his family flee to Rome, determined to destroy the Borgia\u2019s near-complete control of the city\u2019s districts, and rebuild the Assassins (and Rome) in the process. Several popular characters return; Catarina as previously mentioned, Leonardo, Claudia and Maria Auditore, and Machiavelli. Rodrigo Borgia has a few brief scenes as well, but the primary antagonist is Rodrigo\u2019s son, Cesare.\nNow, instead of only upgrading your headquarters, Ezio is buying and refurbishing shops (and landmarks) all over Rome. Completing all the \u201cSons of Romulus\u201d lairs unlocks a special dagger and armor. Completing memories with full synchronization unlocks hidden (\u201crepressed\u201d) Ezio memories of Cristina Vespucci\u2019s fate. Leonardo is a minor character in the main game, but gets an entire DLC to himself (which is included). The Copernicus DLC is also included in the game files, but isn\u2019t accessible to PC players without a mod (search the Steam forums). Add in the huge amount of loot found throughout the game which is used to unlock unique items at shops, the Animus \u201ctraining mode\u201d which is an arcade for honing your combat skills, and there is a wealth of content in Assassin\u2019s Creed Brotherhood.\nThe combat is the largest improvement to Brotherhood over the previous games. The addition of the chain-kill mechanic allows for the rapid dispatch of hordes of enemies. Combat in general flows quicker and smoother in the hands of a skilled player. A strange step backward, though, is the inability to use secondary weapons (like the pistol or crossbow) without selecting them in the weapon wheel first. Also, if you have a secondary weapon selected, doing a hand-focused act \u2013 like tearing down wanted posters \u2013 switches the weapon selection to unarmed. And the platforming was clearly designed for a controller. It\u2019s doable with a keyboard and mouse, but not always intuitive. Expect Ezio to occasionally leap to his death without explanation.\nThe graphics are among the best of the earlier Assassin\u2019s Creed games (Revelations\u2019 are better, but are also much more demanding). Maxing Brotherhood\u2019s graphics settings and hitting 120fps at 1080p proved an easy task (I have an R7 260X graphics card). Texture quality, detail, light, and reflections are the biggest advances over Assassin\u2019s Creed II. Brotherhood is marred, however, by the poor implementation of vertical-sync: turning it on results in horrific frame-rate micro-stutter. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a fix, other than not turning v-sync on. Setting v-sync on in the Radeon Crimson settings didn\u2019t help, either.\nThese are small drawbacks, though. With swift and deadly combat, tons of things to do, and great stories, Assassin\u2019s Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic second part of the \u201cEzio trilogy\u201d of games. A superb sequel and a great game in its own right. It discounts quite low, too, so if you\u2019re a fan of Ezio or Assassin\u2019s Creed in general, there is no reason not to get it.", "hours": 101.1, "username": "AbedsBrother", "products": 834, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

On top of that, every mission now has a secondary objective you can complete for 100% synchronisation, which adds a fun extra challenge. The gameworld is not as interesting, mainly since you only have one city instead of the 4 featured in AC2.\nAlso, in order to buy something at a shop, or unlock a fast travel location, you first have to liberate the district by lighting a heavily guarded tower on fire, and then buy the shop. You have to do this for EVERY shop in the game, which is incredibly annoying. This annoyance is however balanced out by the fact that you don't have to go all the way back to the villa every \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing time you want to deposit your feathers or collect your income.\nIn order to get the best items in the shop, you have to collect specific items of vendor trash that are dropped by enemies and are found in chests. Luckily this is completely optional, since just like in AC2 you get the best armor in the game for free by completing enough freerunning levels.\n(Aside, someone needs to find the guy who thought it was a good idea to have sudden switches to a fixed camera in the middle of timed jumping puzzles, and grant him a swift punch in the stomach)\nThe combat is a lot easier, since the window for counterattacking is a lot bigger and you can chain counterkills. There are also more ranged weapons and if you're lazy you can just press one button and let your assassins murder everyone for you while you sit on a bench nearby watching the fight while eating popcorn.\nAs for the story, there is a lot less character development for Ezio, but the game does have way more interesting villains,  and there is a fantastic subplot concerning a conflict between the assassins themselves about halfway through. Especially Bartholomeo, Machiavelli and La Volpe get some nice character development.\nOverall, the pros and cons compared to AC2 pretty much balance eachother out, and it is definately worth buying.", "hours": 20.2, "username": "QuarantineTarantula", "products": 303, "early_access": false}

An engine with ultra realistic climbing and combat animations.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 AC2 fixed every problem with the original, while at the same time making huge new additions to the series.  Ezio, currency, equipment, upgradable village, sidequests and more.\nfine tuned things even further, and added yet more content and features.  It was impressive, the pinnacle of the series, before AC lost it's writer and then transitioned to a new engine; 1shot1kill meaningful combat, dual hidden blades as a combat weapon, upgrade the entire world now, build a brotherhood, unlock guild perks, unlock gadgets with leo, parachutes, perfect openworld replayability with rewardingly sensible bonus mission objectives, tons of little touches like free jumping or poking out your hidden blades for vanity, and much more.  This game also added unique cat/mouse multiplayer, though I didn't much care for that.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 ACRevelations removed many features, added nothing meaningful, and had a blatant change in writers.  Not only had the tone and setting changed for the worse, but the previous games were practically ignored, even though ACB ended on multiple cliff hangers.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 AC3 moved to a new engine, while it was graphically superior, the gameplay became floaty and overly simplified, with practically none of the depthy features that made AC good, and climbing animations that looked as if they were captured by Twilight's laughable wire team.  The writing was also poor, with a seemingly motivationalless, unlikable, unrelatable, bipolar main character.  The ship combat, however, was amazing here, probably the best ship combat ever put into a video game, sadly only treated as a minigame.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 AC4; PIE RATS.  The story is a bit better here, the engine is a bit better here, the ship combat is a bit worse, but more integrated.  Overall an OK game.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ACRogue takes the best parts of AC3 and AC4 and mushes them into one game.  While it is slightly better than both of those offerings, it still isn't as good as ACB was, once upon a time ago.\n\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 ACU; A fantastic game, lost to an unplayable combat system, and more bugs than Early Access.  Ships have been removed.  Combat has been reduced to stat based button mashing.  However, it did attempt coop, and has decent graphics and customization.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 ACS; A step sideways from Unity, this time with poor performance, parkour has practially been removed, as you can simply zipline around the world.  You can no longer flourish your weapons, jump freely, interact with civilians, or even attack with your hidden blades.  I don't like the setting either, and the story wasn't good enough to keep me interested, even with (or especially because?) it attempts to tell you 5 stories at once.

I loved figuring out the Lairs of Romulus and liberating Rome one Borgia Tower at a time. They introduced assassin recruits which I found very enjoyable and super convenient--you can summon them around any guards or enemies. On occassion they stole the main kills which was a little more than irritating.\nAs usual, the game is visually gorgeous, but I expect no less from Ubisoft at this point. They simply don't put out ugly games, at least I've never seen one in recent years from them.\nI was hoping for more bromance with Leonardo but he wasn't nearly as relevant of a character this time around. His missions were completely optional and I haven't done them yet so I don't know if it leads to anything special when you do them all.\nBut that's another thing to love about AC:B. There is SO much to do. I spent hours not even paying attention to the campaign just wandering, causing trouble, doing side missions. I also enjoyed leaving the Animus too. I personally am very interested in the present-day stuff. It's all leading to something huge, and I'm looking forward to some heavy hitting games in the series the next couple of years.\nEzio is as loveable as always. And Claudia!! She's awesome and I wish there had been more of her. I feel that there was a whole lot more potential to her story than was given. It'd be so cool to see a spinoff just about her over the years, but the chance of that is next to nothing I'm sure.\nThe campaign was great, but the last two sequences were spectacular (nine in total). Sequence 7 had a BRUTAL tracking mission that I loathed entirely, but the payoff happened soon after and was very satisfying to play and to see--probably the most visually striking parts of the game were near the end.\nIt didn't hit me as emotionally as AC2 but they did a damn good job with Brotherhood.

After Ezio fails to assassinate the Borgia Pope, he receives the message for Desmond in the vault. Confused, he returns to Monteriggioni to live a life of peace. That is shortly disrupted when Cesare Borgia appears and lays siege to Monteriggioni in revenge for Ezio's attack on Rodrigo Borgia. Mario, Ezio's uncle, is killed, Ezio is injured, and he flees. Ezio wakes up in the suburbs of Rome, mysteriously healed, and given new Assassin gear. Ezio must now meet up with the Assassins (or what's left of them) in Rome and seek revenge. Not only does Ezio have to do this himself, he must rebuild the Assassin Order. To take on the Pope, you'll need more than just a single, skilled assassin.\nThe gameplay is very similar to AC2. Same type of missions, but with a few extras. Leondardo was forced to build weapons of war based off of some of his most famous drawings and Ezio has to go destroy them to prevent the Templars from using them for their nefarious means. The game also keeps everything in the extremely expansive city of Rome, which feels like it's a much closer scale replica than the other maps. The game even allows you to ride horses to help make the trip around Rome much shorter (although I ended up running or using the sewers instead). The game also introduces Borgia Towers, which prevent you from restoring various areas of the city and gaining income from it. You have to kill the captain in charge of the area and then climb the tower and destroy it. It's a nice little minigame, so many of the towers are blocked off by invisible walls (or basically the restriction of Ezio's memories) so you have to wait to be able to clear them all. The game also gives you another powerful set of armor to retrieve by going through and clearing the lairs of the Followers of Romulus, a pagan cult controlled by the Templars. So much of the gameplay is recycled from the previous game that it feels more like an expansion to AC2 rather than its own game. Building up the Brotherhood was not as exciting as it sounds since you basically rescue some random citizen in the city, they join the cause, and then you send them on missions around the Mediterranean to level up and become full-fledged Assassins. They can also play a role in fights, if you want them to, but I rarely used them, since it wasn't necessary most of the time.\nThe story is in the game is compelling, however, as the story shifts from Rodrigo Borgia, the Pope, to his son, Cesare. It is unclear if Cesare is really loyal to the Templar cause, however, and it kind also seems to distract from the primary Assassin vs. Templar showdown. In fact, that portion of the story doesn't advance very much and few new clues are given. The whole story revolves around Ezio regaining control over the Apple so it's not in the hands of the Templars or Cesare, who wants to use it for his own ends.\nBut Rome seriously makes up for the lackluster gameplay. The scenery was amazing, the landmarks recognizable, and just being in the Eternal City was great for a hobby historian like myself. You find yourself getting lost in the winding streets of the city and learning more about its place in the Renaissance world was fascinating.\nOverall, I think it's not as good as AC2, but if you liked AC2 you'll still enjoy Brotherhood. Enjoy your trip to Rome and continue Ezio's legacy!", "hours": 29.1, "user_id": "76561197993919345", "username": "Hobo McChicken\u00a9\u00ae\u2122", "products": 624, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 74, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-04-19", "text": "Assassin's Creed Brotherhood... its been 5 years since I played this game, I got it for christmas on my PS3 along with AC1,2 and Revelations. Its the 3rd instalment of the AC franchise and it follows the story of AC2. To this day its still known as one of the best AC games, if not the best AC game, if people don't find AC2 their favourite, they find ACB their favourite. As for me? well, lets see\nThe story starts with Ezio returning to Monteriggioni after meeting the goddess Minerva and defeating Rodrigo Borgia, although literally the next day, the Borgia army attacks Monteriggioni and kill Ezio's Uncle Mario and also capture Caterina Sforza, Ezio decides to go back to Rome to find Machiavelli, Ezio, wanting to rebuild the Assassin brotherhood, sets out to find La Volpe, who believes Machiavelli is a traitor and Bartolomeo D'Alviano, who is under attack from the Borgia and the French. Soon after, Ezio finds his mother and sister in Rome and they both want to help Ezio in his quest to stop the Borgia. With the courtesans, thieves and mercenaries on Ezio's side, they finally decide to rebuild Rome and free its people from the Borgia. Machiavelli orders Ezio to kill Cesare and Rodrigo in the Castel Sant'Angelo, however Ezio is determined to find Caterina and free her first. By doing this, Ezio ends up not being able to kill Cesare and Rodrigo is missing from the castle entirely. After being freed by Ezio, Caterina returns to Forli to fight off the Borgia there. Ezio then decides that the only way to defeat the Borgia is to rely on the people being oppressed by the Borgia and are willing to fight. Then the story sort of sits back for the gameplay for a bit, then after a while, La Volpe decides he's had enough of Machiavelli and attempts to kill him, however Ezio finds who the real traitor is in the Borgia and its revealed to be some person who helps you escape from Monteriggioni during the attack, Ezio rushes to La Volpe to stop him from killing Machiavelli, so... yeah that wasn't really a huge dramatic moment, in the mission that happens it goes by in like 3 minutes or so. Anyways, Ezio decides to go to the Castel Sant'Angelo one last time to kill Cesare and Rodrigo, he finds out that Cesare had taken control over the Borgia army and was the one who wanted to attack Monteriggioni so quickly, so Rodrigo poisons Cesare but is then killed by the power hungry Cesare, Ezio then races Cesare to find the Apple of Eden, Ezio ends up finding it and has Cesare on the run begging for back up and ordering for Ezio's execution, however Cesare becomes powerless and is eventually arrested for incest, murder and other crimes in the city. He tells Ezio that chains will not hold him forever, Ezio takes this warning seriously and uses the Apple to find out what exactly will happen to Cesare, he finds out that he will escape and that he must be stopped. So for one final time, Ezio fights Cesare in the flashback that you see at the start of the game. After a long fight, Ezio throws Cesare off the castle walls and returns to Rome to place the Apple of Eden in a temple under the colosseum. Which then Desmond will find it in the year 2012 and- oh.. I didn't talk about the modern day story did I?\nSo the modern day story also takes place after AC2, where Desmond, Lucy, Shaun and Rebecca are escaping from Abstergo and retreat to Monteriggioni, Desmond goes into the animus and y'know, welcome to AC Brotherhood, but after finding out where the Apple of Eden is, Desmond retrieves it but is frozen by the goddess Juno, who then steers Desmond into Lucy's direction, activates Desmond's hidden blade and stabs Lucy. As it turns out, Lucy was an Abstergo agent this whole time and was going to kill Desmond after being given the Apple, this isn't explained in Brotherhood, but you can find it out in the DLC of Revelations and its confirmed in Assassin's Creed 3. Overall, I love this story, its simple yet an amazing way to finish the fight between Ezio and the Borgia, which in only just 2 games, we've played through 30 years of Ezio's life. From when he was 17 to a 40 year old man. The modern day is also way better than how it was in AC1 or 2.\nThere's also the DLC 'The Da Vinci Disappearance' which takes place just after Brotherhood, there's nothing really important about it until you find a temple which has co-ordinates reading 43 39 19 N 75 27 42 W. Which actually leads to New York if you search for it on Google, which if you played AC3, it leads to the Grand Temple where Desmond will die, Ezio knows this isn't for him so he leaves it until Desmond will find the co-ordinates. Its a nice little tie in and stuff like this really makes you think, how long did Ubisoft have the AC story planned out for?\nSo now time for the gameplay... as Ezio, you can do everything you could in AC2 except its far more polished this time, counter attacks or attacks in general are a lot smoother, you can now kick opponents in the balls which is a lot of fun as its basically the most overpowered attack, because any enemy that you can't grab normally, well since they're concentrating on protecting their balls, you can just grab them and kill them, same goes for heavy guards who become so weak if you kill them with this method. Also counter attacks can kill just about anyone, its a shame you have to buy upgrades from Leonardo to use the higher jumps when climbing, but its not like its essential for anything, just an easier way of doing things. The buildings are all close to each other, a bit more like AC1 but the map is a lot easier to remember and you can now fast travel around the city! I never really use this feature since I enjoy running around the city and its relatively easy to get through, but its a good feature which comes in handy in future games. Throughout your journey you'll be fighting the Borgia, but to make sure they're wiped out, you will have to go to several Borgia towers, where you kill a captain and then burn down the tower they control. This frees up the area for you to buy buildings and stores, I love finding new ways on how to kill the Borgia captains and it never gets tiring. Graphically speaking, its a huge step up from AC2 and while its nothing spectacular, its a fantastic looking game for the PS3/Xbox 360. For a game developed in just 9 months, this game had a lot of effort put into it, in fact... Ubisoft were working on Revelations whilst making this game, and both games turned out great, Revelations ironically turned out to be the weaker game, but its also good. People don't like Brotherhood because it feels too much like AC2... but, really, its doing everything right. Taking stuff from the previous game and improving on it. Its not a huge change in gameplay style like AC3, 4 and every future instalment is, its just sticking to the AC1/AC2 formula which is a good thing. Its consistent, its fun and I can honestly say AC Brotherhood, after 5 years of replaying it, its still my favourite AC game.\nAlso the music is absolutely fantastic and its one of the best Assassin's Creed soundtracks ever, I mean yeah Ezio's family is re-used but at least it makes sense in this game, but the ambient music when going around the city, the fight music, the dramatic music when burning a Borgia tower, its great. Its kinda sad that Jesper Kyd doesn't make the AC soundtracks anymore, I mean don't get me wrong, AC3,4 and Origins soundtrack is great, but Rogue, Unity, Syndicate and most of Origins just has something missing. Hell even AC3/4 does.\nAnyways, if you're just getting into the series, start off with this game, you don't even need to be an Assassin's Creed fan to like this game, its just an amazing game which anyone could enjoy. Its easily one of the best games I've played. Good job Ubisoft. However, they should really return to this sort of level. 3 consistently amazing games... then after we had 2 great games with minor issues then the rest just had a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ton of issues...", "hours": 28.2, "username": "Alta\u00efr", "products": 59, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 78, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-03-14", "text": "AC:Brotherhood while a good game is a bit disappointing in a few ways.\nSo after the so called \u201cGods-Not-Gods\u201d you interact with at the end of AC 2, Brotherhood picks up shortly after that moment in what will become a tireless exercise for the series. The tireless exercise is that from this point on, Assassin\u2019s Creed drip feeds you it\u2019s story. If you thought the story was moving at a snail's pace, well AC:Brotherhood moves a heck of a lot slower which unfortunately becomes a common occurrence in the series. This is completely frustrating and really an unforgivable indictment on the series. In present time, a some plot threads from AC 2 are just dropped and forgotten. In AC 2 you learn that Desmond starts seeing things from the Animus in the real world, like glimpses or \u201cghosts\u201d of Acre, which then turns into a dream that controls much like an Animus session except without all the help of the Animus. In AC: Brotherhood, nothing like that ever happens. As a matter of fact it\u2019s a plot point that is dropped to never be returned to again. This strikes me as Ubisoft redacting certain story elements that would then converge into a new story that would allow them to drip feed the story from game to game. Also the present story is rendered moot, because there is almost zero emotional ties to what is happening. In AC2 you learn that Desmond is sorry for the way he treated Lucy at Abstergo and that Lucy believes in him. In AC Brotherhood you get none of that. Just exposition piled on exposition and it\u2019s quite unfortunate. Ultimately the only moment that moves our characters along in their respective arcs is the ending which tries to ape the crazy ending of AC2, but is a lot less successful. This ending doesn\u2019t help anything at all. All it does is raise questions and answers none of the ones that were raised last time. At this point, the more I think about the state of the present story, the more it pisses me off. Look, the present story in AC1 and 2 wasn\u2019t anything to write home about, but it did give us a hook to latch on to. We could empathize with the characters and hope that they would get out of this okay, but in Brotherhood and subsequent iterations  or at least in Brotherhood, there is nothing that moves their arcs in any direction and it\u2019s downright frustrating.\nWhen it comes to Ezio\u2019s story thankfully there\u2019s a lot less inconsistencies although they are still there. It\u2019s thoroughly enjoyable story that shows us the weakness\u2019 that the Assassins have. Ezio\u2019s in particular. You see that he cares about people in a way others just don\u2019t. It leads him to go out of his way to help his friends and comrades and make sure they make it out alright and he doesn\u2019t leave them to just die. It endeared me to the character and makes him much more relatable. Also there is a lot less exposition, which helps. Lastly the inconsistencies are few, but still present. Ezio\u2019s mother for example seems to have forgotten that half of her family has died. She is in a chipper mood and it just strikes me as unbelievable. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the game took place years after the second, but it doesn\u2019t it literally takes place right after the second. By the end of the second game, Ezio\u2019s mother was talking again, but only slightly she was still mourning. In this game we see none of that, and I\u2019m not saying that she should be completely depressed, but the fact that she is happy strikes me as odd. We are left to assume that she\u2019s just over it, like the death of her family \u201cis sooo last year\u201d. Okay you can see that it bothers me, but it\u2019s true.\nThe gameplay is where Assassin\u2019s Creed Brotherhood suffers the most. It\u2019s entirely playable, but it\u2019s much the same as AC 2. If that bothers you then you probably won\u2019t find much to like in this game beyond the story and environment. However, there\u2019s no criticism I can give that you haven\u2019t already heard a thousand times before, but what I can say is positive things. Yes, Positive! For one the A.I thankfully is far more consistent. In AC2 it felt like every other enemy I sneaked up to would turn around like I was making tons of noise. Now, for the most part they will only turn around if you are making a ruckus, now I said for the most part, unfortunately there are still times that enemies will turn around even if you sneak up to them and other times where they won\u2019t see you whatsoever. Now the game adds some mechanics that I thought were pretty fine, but some reviewers seemingly lambasted the game for. You eventually pick up a crossbow that shoots as fast and as far as a gun. This is great for the rooftop excursions where I just shoot a guard so it won\u2019t just start chasing me. Also there is the chain kill mechanic in where once you subdue a foe you can then kill others by just clicking the button which will turn into a one hit kill for each enemy until you are interrupted. All these things might take away from the challenge, but honestly if I got two more AC\u2019s with AC2 controls I don\u2019t care. It makes the game less frustrating and then more enjoyable. Now the last thing I want to touch on is optional objectives. Some people don\u2019t like them, but I never had any trouble with them, which makes me wonder why people are complaining in the first place. I loved them, because it forced me to actually be an assassin. It was awesome, even if it kinda forces you on a scripted path. I enjoyed them and I personally think they are a great addition to the series.\nNow  when it comes to environments, it\u2019s as always awesome. I have actually been to Rome once before and when I went to Coliseum in this game, it was cool just, how much it was like the real thing. That\u2019s pretty much it. Rome is a beautifully rendered environment and Nuff said.\nMy experience might be unique with my system, but if AC 2 gave you graphical performance issues then you are in for much of the same in AC Brotherhood. The game would drop frames out of nowhere and for one stretch was stuttering uncontrollably. It was incredibly annoying. So it pains me to say that AC Brotherhood is poorly optimized with the caveat, that it might be unique to my setup, maybe you might have more luck. On the plus side it never gets to the point where the game is just unplayable.\nAssassin\u2019s creed Brotherhood is a double edged sword. It\u2019s is technically a better game than AC2, but it also suffers from some of the same problems, but as well as some new ones. I do recommend the game and it is a good addition to the series, but not a great one.", "hours": 62.2, "username": "Neutron John", "products": 961, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I recommend the game because it's fun and entertaining and if that's what you're looking for then great but if you're a seasoned gamer then you probably want to avoid this; it's going to bore you.\nThe combat is so dumbed down and an example of this is countering. All you have to do is press the counter button at the right time and your guy will automatically position himself and rotate to take out the enemy. Large groups of enemies pose barely any threat as they basically wait their turn to attack you. \"I see you're attacking my friend there, no problem buddy I\u2019ll wait until you're finished before I start to attack you\". It's so easy, I haven't died once yet, and have barely lost any health. In fact I've lost more health from fall damage because he often wouldn't jump the direction I was pointing lol.\nThe game is also so planned out for you. So much hand holding. Sneak in without being detected by guards. There just happens to be a big pile of hay to jump down into, and the only guard in the vicinity just happens to be standing in front, with his back to you for an easy kill.\nHowever, the story in the game is well done and there is quite a lot of depth in this game which is awesome. For example you can invest in places or you can hire and send assassin recruits on missions and you can train them up to help you in battle. That's why I recommend this game. It may be a bit simple but the fact is the game is still entertaining and I'm having fun playing it.", "hours": 12.8, "username": "Holocene", "products": 171, "early_access": false}

The story was more convoluted and even harder to follow than in Assassins Creed 2, and had one of what I consider the laziest cliches where there's an enemy (who I still don't know what his name is) you have to kill but all he does is run away and is always just barely out of your grasp until the final fight. The final fight was pretty cool, but it was a little sad having to wait around 15 hours for that.\nLike Assassins Creed 2 there's some secret caves you can explore to unlock some cool armor, but unlike in Assassins Creed 2 by the time you get all these caves unlocked, the end of the game is just a few missions away. It's hardly worth using that awesome armor when you've already done everything in game. They also managed to make the menus even worse than the previous two games, and while Brotherhood definitely isn't as obvious of a console port as Assassins Creed 2 the horrendous map mechanics make me wish I was playing with the terrible console port controls of 2.\nAnd finally, the ending (while good) was totally ruined by 18 yes 18 minutes of unskippable credits. It doesn't count as you finishing the game unless you sit through all 18 minutes, but I don't care enough to see whatever post-credit scene there might be so I just closed the game after using my phone for 5 minutes and realizing the credits weren't going to end anytime soon.\nIt's sad that just minor things like this really downed my feelings on Brotherhood. It's ambitions compared to the last two and may even have more things to do in it than Assassins Creed 2, even if it's in a smaller world, but the all over the place story and honestly just the credits made me dislike this game in the end.

Still captivating, interesting, with lots of likable and not likable characters.\n- If AC I was repetitive and AC II not so much, AC II Brotherhood is a mixture of the two, but in a positive way. If you like grinding (like I do, especially in beautiful Roman surroundings), there is a lot of it  (A LOT). And somehow it didn't bore me. On a contrary: additional quests were interesting, many of them different, only some of them felt lazy. Flags are back, and of course feathers and treasure chests.\n- Game gives you option to either buy maps which point to all the hidden stuff, but you don't have to buy them. You can grind them by yourself. Options are always a good thing.\n- Environment, architecture, Rome, graphics, music: sometimes you just want to ride around Colosseum with no purpose other then admire stuff around you and in distant perspective.\n- Eagle vision is still useful!\n- Leonardo's war machines quest line was one hell of a ride.\n- You will be able to rebuild assassins brotherhood, recruit your own people, train them and use their help should you choose so. This is a blast. One completely new instalment and it is awesome.\nCons:\n- So many weapons, and majority of it still serves only as collection trophies.\n- I remember that throwing knives were useful in AC I. Somehow they are not useful here (as they weren't in AC II).\n- Combat is as it was. I think I got used to it, but it has not been improved. Oh, wait, you can kick people now to break their guard.\n- Freakin camera angle almost made me pull my hair out during few missions.\n- There is this new stuff I don't recall from before: full synch. To fully synchronize you are required to finish the memory in given way. Sometimes it will demand from you to take no damage (really? Where's fun in taking no damage?), sometimes it requires you to complete memory in few minutes (forcing you to get back to the location for full discovery which can take three times that long). The only synch requirements I liked were the ones that enforced stealth play (aka. not being detected). But I guess it's a matter of taste.\n- I don't remember any outstanding bug. Oh, but it's a cons section. I guess I expected them as a \"fun\" part of the game. Ubisoft is bending perspectives ;)\nOverall:\nI love this game.

Fortunately I own a mac and a pc, and while I literally cannot log into uplay without it crashing on pc, it worked okay (not great, but okay) on my macbook. So while uplay is a massive pain, I'll try to stick to reviewing the actual game.\nThe most important part of a game in my opinion is the gameplay, and that is definitely the best part of AC: Brotherhood. Freerunning around Rome, climbing all over mysterious ruins, and generally exploring and getting around the map, even outside of missions, is a lot of fun. Solving the various puzzles within the levels is also a blast. The combat is definitely too easy, and I could confidently take on dozens of enemies at once, as they just stand around yelling at me, attacking one by one. I understand why it is like this, where's the fun in realistically being beaten to death by dozens of guards at once, however fights with large numbers of enemies happens regularly, and it is extremely noticeable. As to plot, AC: Brotherhood has a decent story going for it, but I found it a bit over the top a lot of the time, kinda melodramatic, then again it's a videogame, and that's par for the course, almost required. The plot is definitely a good length, not cutting off too abruptly or dragging on forever, and outside of the story missions there is a lot to do. It's difficult to say how long the plot is, since my game time is not displaying properly. I've actually played through the game twice, and played a significant amount of the multiplayer, which isn't terribly active these days, but can be an absolute blast if you find a time where enough people are playing. There is some replayability to the game, but not tons. Going back through the memories and replaying specific missions that you enjoyed is a nice feature, so that you don't have to replay the entire game, can just enjoy the 'highlight reel'.\nOverall, I think the game is worth playing, and is one of the stronger entries to the series, but would Ubisoft please just kill uplay with fire already?

Ah, the memories of jumping out at the purse snatcher and jamming the butter knife directly into his ribcage..  The sweat dripping off my bald head, my heart pounding.. my face hitting the ground as I realized I'm not Enzio and the man I just jammed in the stomach is 6'3 and close to 300 pounds.. After a nice nap, I woke up in the hospital.. Not one to feel discouraged, I vowed to get revenge on that over sized Neanderthal.  After all he had knocked out my front tooth..\nEnough about that..  It's time to talk about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, or as I like to call it Assassin's Creed 2.5.\nThe Story:  Brotherhood picks up the story after the second game.  Enzio returns to Monteriggioni after he successful retrieved the Apple.  He returns to a hero's welcome, and numerous offers of \"ahem\" favors from the local town woman.  Our resident playboy settles for a night with Caterina Sforza.  All is going well for Enzio, he's a hero, he's gotten his revenge, he's got himself a sexy MILF, he's going to live happily ever after...  Since this is a game, we all figured out this wasn't going to happen..  Que the music...   (puts on Hammer Time by MC Hammer)  After some vigorous relations with Caterina Monteriggioni is attacked by a new Atagonist Cesare Borgia.  Needless to say the attack left Mario dead and Monteriggioni in shambles..  Guess a relocation is in order.\nLeft with nothing Enzio is tasked with rebuilding the Assassin Brotherhood, while at the same time getting justice against the Borgia clan and reclaiming the apple once more..  This time around the game takes place in Roma.. better known as Rome, a very large and vibrant city.  You'll meet numerous people in your travels and back yet again is everyone's favorite painter and cheapskate Leonardo Di Vinci,\nThe Gameplay:  If you've played Assassin's Creed 2, you know fully what to expect in Brotherhood, the few additions to take note of..  Money serves a fair larger role in Brotherhood, gone is the building of a city, now you are tasked with rebuilding an entire City-State.  You gain revenue from the various businesses and landmarks that you purchase.  A new feature are the Borgia Towers, which have replaced many of the view points.  You need to kill the Guard Captain, then make your way up the Borgia tower to set it ablaze.  As you take out Borgia towers you reduce the Borgia's power and open up new businesses and landmarks that you can buy.  Another awesome idea is building of the Assassin Brotherhood, you can recruit assassins..  The more Borgia towers you control the more assassins you can own..  I believe the max is 10.  Also this time around various guilds exist which allow you to climb their ranks (although aside from dropping the price to hire the various helpers (courtesans, mercenaries or thieves I didn't notice any other benefits).   You can send your Assassins away on contracts of various difficulties, these earn the assassins experience, and money for you.  Occasionally you'll be rewarded with items as well.\nThe Combat:  Not much has been changed from the second game. The few changes are as follows.. You gain access to a crossbow!!!  A nice ranged weapon which allows you to silently kill enemies from afar.  Unlike the gun which makes noise and attracts attention, the Crossbow is silent and quite deadly.  Unarmed combat includes a few new animations for unarmed kills, such as a curb stomp, and neck breaking.  You can also chain kill this time around, which is very useful for those times when you are surrounded by 8 or 9 enemies, after you execute the first enemy, you can immediately focus and execute another without the need to fight them, repeat this as much as possibly until you need to counter attack.  The biggest change over all is the ability to call your Assassins into combat, or order them to take out guards.  Instead of having to get your hands dirty and risk tipping off the guards, you send in your crew, they clean up the guards then run off..   This is the single biggest game changer about brother hood..  Nothing beats having an army of 7 - 8 buffed up assassins at the ready for any of those large scale battles (although only about 3 - 4 of these battles exist unfortunately)\nThe conclusion... If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed 2, you'll enjoy Brotherhood.  While the game itself feels like a rather large expansion, it has enough meat and potatoes to stand on it's own.  So buy it, enjoy it..", "hours": 21.8, "username": "Orge Lambart", "products": 10532, "found_funny": 23, "early_access": false}

While AC2 felt like a huge step from AC1, in this case the changes are not that big. Ubisoft left the basics from what made AC2 great and added a whole bunch of extra stuff. This time it is just one city - Rome, that is divided into 4 districts. Still present is a really good storyline where Ezio is already established but builds up his brotherhood of assassins. The game is still fun and has lots of side missions to keep you occupied for hours. However, some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are just plain annoying. But I guess this is to counteract the fact that once you have you assassins that you can call upon the game goes into easy mode. So the only real challenge comes from the artificial requirements of the 100% completion system. The combat is the same as in AC2. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. This time we see more of the Desmond timeline of which I am a fan. Some flaws are funky camera placement in some cases and sometimes weird AI. I would complain about uPlay but you all know what playing Ubisoft games is like. You simply need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is awesome and while slightly worse than AC2 it still is worth your money.

I did notice a new day/night lighting cycle, and greater variety in character models around the city.\nHowever, the gameplay has been tuned significantly. I found the free-running much smoother in this game; I spent less time jumping accidentally against walls that I didn't mean to climb. Brotherhood seems to know where I want to go much better than AC2 did.\nBut mechanics aside, it's the new mission structure that really impressed me. Brotherhood takes a lesson from the Grand Theft Auto series -- the city of Rome is huge, and there's always something nearby that you can get involved with. The major missions come more naturally; you don't feel funneled towards them in Brotherhood like you do in AC2. You can take them on early, or muck around in the city for a long while before addressing the major story.\nAnd - the story. The Assassin's Creed storyline is still wonderful, and improves in Brotherhood. The cut scenes are well-balanced so they don't dominate gameplay. The body models are expressive and evocative, and the voice acting is excellent. I find that I really care about these characters and what's happening in the story. Also, Brotherhood really improves Desmond's meta-story.\nLast comment - Assassin's Creed has the best cities in video games, hands down. Brotherhood takes place almost exclusively in Rome during the renaissance. The city and nearby countryside is massive! But the attention to detail is remarkable.

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 92, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-02", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood follows the same system as the previous title, just slightly improved, more beautiful, not as big as AC2, but equally concrete when it comes to gameplay and mechanics.\nWe continue the adventures of Ezio, immediately after AC2 ends, not even 10 minutes pass before being violently attacked by the Borgias, who come after the Piece of Eden in our possession, Ezio\u2019s decision on AC2 has direct consequences that bring death and destruction, everything we struggled for has vanished, wounded and with no clue what to do, Ezio follows a small trail to Roma, where our new adventure takes place.\nIt happens that Roma suffers under the Borgias regime, people feel oppressed and it\u2019s up to the Creed to liberate it. Ezio gets in touch with old friends and assassins that will help him rebuild the Brotherhood and start looking for the Piece of Eden and destroy once and for all the greed that suffocates the population and the city. Along with his friends, the assassins start recruiting new members and start creating a vast net of contacts that will support every decision we make, get resources and new tools for the task at hand.\nAC:B takes what was presented on AC2 and improves it, combat feels more fluid and concise, fighting multiple enemies is now easier while the kill streaks are simple and demand no that much of a tactical approach, we count with new gadgets, thanks to our friend Leonardo da Vinci, who helps us once again, but under different circumstances. Now we have more chances to kill silently from a distance with poison darts fired from our hidden blade, which come in handy every time you want to sneak into a place or to have fun with the guards as they \u201cdance\u201d to the poison\u2019s effect, the pistol reacts faster now and can be also used while engaging into combos to eliminate your enemies in a faster way. The rest of the weapons do not vary that much from the previous title, however it\u2019s up to you if you want to buy them as you can collect them just like before.\nFree-running follows the same structure, but it feels slightly better, there are not many new things regarding this aspect, it\u2019s the same old system with not many variations, it works better at times and some other times it just doesn\u2019t, something that AC has been struggling with since the first title.\nAs for new ideas, AC:B introduces an investment system, trading has been revamped and feels great to be able to repair old structures and buy buildings. Every time you buy a store you can revive the trading system which allows you to invest some money that every 20 minutes pays off with a certain amount of income which can be withdrawn from the bank so you can repair, buy and invest once again, nice idea here, this makes you feel that the city is constantly under a lively trading system. Tailors, blacksmiths, art dealers, doctors are part of the system, as well as new choices like stables, banks, an underground system that connects various locations in Roma, faction buildings (thieves, courtesans and mercenaries) or simply buildings and famous creations that look exactly like the real ones.\nThe recruitment system is also a great improvement, every time you liberate a zone from Borgia occupation, you can aid citizens and once you help them they offer they support to join the Brotherhood, then it comes the training, for this a new idea comes up, for them to improve and become a true assassin, they can be sent to different parts of Europe to perform missions and collect resources, once they deal with a mission they get XP that helps them to level up and get a new title. Once they are done and reach max level, they are ready to get the title of Assassin. When they are not away on a mission, they can help you fight if you feel you are overwhelmed by enemies or you can simply activate the Arrow Storm option, which eliminates a certain number of foes in a second, this new idea is excellent, it gives you the feel of being always supported and empowered.\nThey haven\u2019t improved that much, though, some textures look smoother and it\u2019s quite different to AC2, because we are most of the time on the same place, which is Roma, on AC2 we travelled to several cities which differentiate from each other, although the city looks great, the old structures that are depicted in detail are great, the Coliseum being the more attractive esthetically, there are some muddy textures here and there, but they do not have a deep impact on the whole concept of Roma, the water still looks stagnated and static, but as we are not on a diving game, it tends to be just a simple decoration for the city, it still looks ugly, though. The skies look clearer, the moon always shines above us at night, clouds look much more real, something that AC2 lacked. Overall, graphics do not stand out that much, but it remains a beautiful game nonetheless.\nThe music has always been important in AC games, especially when we started with Ezio\u2019s adventures, every tune fits perfectly the diverse situations that we face in every mission, the feeling of being sneaky or just face to face with multiple enemies, or every time we explore a catacomb or some underground temple, it enriches the sense of adventure and mystery that surrounds the AC games, the overall sound effects are great, there is not much to add here, the sound fulfills the expectations for an AC game, it stands out on its own.\nWhile not being that terrible, AC:B suffers from the same problems that AC2 did, sometimes actions you perform tend to have a different outcome when fighting or free-running, this is sometimes really annoying when trying to escape from a fight or when you just want to go incognito, many times I found myself climbing the opposite direction or attacking civilians because it happened the selection attack found that particular citizen right next to me, if killing civilians is forbidden for assassins, why not just make them a non-target option?, especially in a fight, which mostly happens in the middle of the city crowded with nonmilitary population. Another annoying aspect of these games is the tailing missions, they are already the worst kind of mission in AC games and they tend to be repetitive, long and dull, with few strategic options other than staying hidden or incognito.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood surely does not disappoint, it follows the same principles as the previous title, it has all the elements of a fictional/historical storyline, many real characters appear here as well, which adds veracity and a sense of realism few games have, and it also keeps us following the steps of our hero, one we watched being born, growing up, becoming an assassin and now mentor of the Italian Brotherhood, Ezio is older, yes, but wiser and not just that, he also shows many improvements as character, he has accepted his fate as an assassin, one that came with pain and suffering, however this only gives him the strength to continue struggling.", "hours": 83.2, "username": "PandaFraHelvete", "products": 312, "early_access": false}

Also, once you enter a battle, you can't leave, there no no such option as running away, even though the entire first mission is comprised of you running away. This is a complete piece of sht.

No new notable characters have been introduced, additions to gameplay are minor and differences to the script similarly so: you essentially lose everything from Assassin's Creed 2 during the prologue and spend the rest of the game trying to build back your base of operation. Meaning, don't begin your Assassin's Creed experience from this title onwards because you start\nas Assassin's Creed 2 drops off; so yes, spoilers.\nSecondly, one of the defining aspects of the game (specifically, the brotherhood of assassins whom you recruit) works entirely by a time-passage mechanic.  If Assassin's Creed 2 allowed you to cheat the system by waiting so as to gain additional income, Brotherhood sends your assassin recruits away on missions where success is based entirely on a percentage, with no involvement on your part.\nThird, although I love how your missions now have additional challenges, autosaving on your failures and the inability to skip cutscenes are just artificial obstacles that any game producer respectful of their customers would've removed already. Neither can you skip the end credits, and the game won't acknowledge you've finished the story until the whole 20 minute thing has passed. Alt-tabbing pauses the credits.\nProduction was so lazy, it warped the whole story stupid.

No new notable characters have been introduced, additions to gameplay are minor and differences to the script similarly so: you essentially lose everything from Assassin's Creed 2 during the prologue and spend the rest of the game trying to build back your base of operation. Meaning, don't begin your Assassin's Creed experience from this title onwards because you start\nas Assassin's Creed 2 drops off; so yes, spoilers.\nSecondly, one of the defining aspects of the game (specifically, the brotherhood of assassins whom you recruit) works entirely by a time-passage mechanic.  If Assassin's Creed 2 allowed you to cheat the system by waiting so as to gain additional income, Brotherhood sends your assassin recruits away on missions where success is based entirely on a percentage, with no involvement on your part.\nThird, although I love how your missions now have additional challenges, autosaving on your failures and the inability to skip cutscenes are just artificial obstacles that any game producer respectful of their customers would've removed already. Neither can you skip the end credits, and the game won't acknowledge you've finished the story until the whole 20 minute thing has passed. Alt-tabbing pauses the credits.\nProduction was so lazy, it warped the whole story stupid.

It is more or less the same thing in terms of mechanics, with some additional weapons and the option to summon assassins to eliminate targets for you. You also get to head the assassin's guild which allows you to recruit new assassins, send them on missions and stuff. The world is, like in the previous game, amazingly crafted, with lots of areas to explore and rooftops to parkour on. Parkouring is fun, although you'll sometimes fly off a wall because the camera spazzed out or you were moving too fast to direct your character adequately etc. When this happens it breaks the flow and can feel quite frustrating. While assassinating targets remains fun (pulling them to their deaths when hanging off ledges or dropping on them from above etc), the combat is still awful (guards stand around you in a circle, waiting for their turn to attack), and the voice acting is just as atrocious as in the previous game, with a bunch of North American voice actors continuing to do an awful job at faking Italian accents... I suggest turning on Italian audio, it improves the immersion anyway.", "hours": 29.7, "username": "gwwtbg", "products": 216, "early_access": false}

However, this time he is 40 years old, not 17-40 like in the AC2. This is overall a great game. The climbing is just as good as AC2 and AC1. That being said there are some minor problems in the map. We'll get into the pros and cons later, now we will talk about the story.\nAt the beggining of the game you begin right where you left of in AC2. For those of you that like a game because of the story, buy AC2 first it will make the story more clear. After leaving the vault you reunite with Uncle Mario. After returning back to the Villa you are greeted by the beautiful Catarina Sforza, whom you bang that night. Afterwards the villa is attacked my Ceasere Borgia, The pope's \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 son. He takes back the apple of eden and kills Mario. :( Ezio then goes to Rome seeking revenege and the Apple. After reuniting with the other Assassin's, Ezio liberates Rome and gives it back to the people.\nPros\n- Great Gameplay\n- Goodish Story\n- Climbing is still good\n- Corteseans are still good looking\n- There's a sex scene!\n- Plenty of side missions\nCons\n- Rome's map is all over the place. Some buildings are high above others and you cant climb them without stopping and going around.\n- The master armor looks more like a winter jacket than an Assassin's hood.\n- Money is scarce and buildings are too expensive\n- Character develpment is limited\nVerdict\nACBH is good game with lots to do. However, the story just isn't as good as AC2. Ezio doesn't seem to grow as much as he did in AC2. Which does make sense but it would be better if he connected with his sister more instead of just feeling bad about not being behind her for 25 years. The climbing would be way better if the map wasn't so messed up. Anyway, this game is fun but if you are looking for story rich, fast paced game. Play AC2 or Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. If you want a fun, open-world game with some stealth and some loud pound this is the game for you. I give it a 7.5/10.", "hours": 13.8, "user_id": "76561198137248613", "username": "Spacy Jaguar", "products": 45, "early_access": false}

The combat has become quicker and better with sequenced executions and  you get a ton of opportunities to fully exercise these new skills throughout the game. Added on is the fact that you can recruit other assassins and manage a guild, which I found an interesting element of gameplay. The storyline is somewhat more predictable than in Assassin's Creed 2, but it nonetheless carries through just fine. Aside from that, multiplayer is good, but rather basic.

The map is shorter than all the combined maps of the previous game, but Rome feels more cohesive and alive, because the crowds are more dynamic and diversified. The combat is mostly the same, except for a new \"kill streak\" that makes it easier but more fluid. The stealth sections are also unchanged, but a new crossbow also makes it easier. This game also introduced a replay mission feature, optional objectives, and your own assassin's guild, making combat and stealth even easier, but it's a nice addition.

Being able to use a parachute glide anywhere is quite a nice feature, but I didn't find it useful very often. The best bit is being able to recruit and call-in your own assassins to take out whoever you like.\nUnfortunately, it's all let down by the implementation and design being inexcusably sloppy in places. I found quite a number of bugs which made me lose progress (although in most cases the check-points are quite frequent so I didn't lose much time overall). I also had almost constant controller problems. I'm not sure if this is specific to using the Xbox 360 controller, but it was very hard to make Ezio actually go where I wanted during climbing/free-running. He frequently leapt in the wrong direction.\nThe worst part though is the mission design. A ridiculous number of them assumed you'd do things in a specific way which wasn't obvious at all. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why mission events didn't trigger and so on. In addition, the tasks were often very repetitive and dull. Way too many \"follow this person\" objectives.\nHaving completed the story now, I wish I hadn't bothered with this game. The plot is quite weak and un-engaging.

Uplay is completely stable these days and hasn't given me a single problem in about a year.\nWhenever I hear somebody say Assassin's Creed II is the best game of the series, I just want to tell them to replay it. It's glitchy and controls terribly, especially after being used to the updated control refinements that AC:III and Black Flag introduced. That being said, This game doesn't control as well as the aforementioned two games, but the controls are tighter and, overall, the intuitive nature of the parkour/jumping algorithms are significantly improved.\nThe graphics, while not a drastic overhaul from its predecessor, are quite good and there seems to be more attention to detail in the texture work within the environment. Also the lighting is noticably superior.\nI would say the only thing that may be worse in this game than it's predecessor is the story.

The writing and facial animation seems just a little bit more believable and better overall, the sandbox gameplay is enhanced with the addition of new mechanics like upgrading shops and managing assassins, and the mission design manages to be less frustrating and, in general, less bug-ridden than AC2. Also, the combat feels a lot more fun and interesting than AC2 - they've added mechanics so you can effectively deal with all enemy types without resorting to just hitting them over and over again (which I felt was all I could do in the previous game - if there were other techniques I was having a hard time figuring them out), and added an insta-kill mechanic that keeps things moving along more quickly. This is a big thing for this game - in my opinion, the combat was one of the things that made me really not like AC2. The actual story and characters involved in the story feel more fleshed out due to the better voice acting, direction, animation, and writing. Finally, the length feels a bit better, or, even if the expected clear-time was around the same, felt more justified. AC2 felt like it dragged on without adding anything interesting.\nThere's still some stuff that might've been better. The variety in voice clips from enemies and civilians seems pretty much unchanged from AC2. It gets somewhat immersion breaking hearing the same voices from all of the same enemies, as if you're always just fighting an army of clones. The parkour/traversal sections feel like a bit of a slow, boring slog, because there's really not much to do other than slowly climb your way through the only route forward, and if you mess up, re-do the slow climbing. Being able to move faster through those sections would have been nice, as well as maybe adding some variety or challenge so it doesn't just feel like you're \"going through the motions\". I just wanted those sections (like the optional temples of Romulus) to be over. The levels and the way you move through them are interesting and clearly a lot of thought and attention to detail went into them, but they just manage to be kind of boring. The only time they end up being challenging is when Ezio ends up not doing what you thought he was going to do or what you wanted him to do, and you have to re-do a boring climbing section.\nOverall, a fun sandbox / open world action game.

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 106, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-09-12", "text": "With due respect, I'm humbly representing my thoughts about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood in my own point of view. Tell you what, This is one of the crown jewels of Assassin's Creed series. It gives you the most masterful experience about a true Assassin. Like you are gonna be legendary mentor, Ezio Auditore with iconic skills and master plans. Now let me share my thoughts about it in very few options.\nStory is one of the momentous things about this title. As always, the story has been affiliated with historical theme and beliefs. The story tells about how Ezio Auditore takes his revenge and finds justice between roguish warriors. It's story has been continued from Assassin's Creed II. You'll get yourself in an immersive adventure as Ezio Auditore. Will take you through some of the very complex events to reach conclusion. I would say the story is really well tailored. Like what should be your story when your everything has been destroyed and taken. As an assassin, your judgement and plans must be wise and masterful, not like simple person. So this is how his adventure begins. Ezio liberates a beautiful city called Roma edgewise he fights for his revenge. Every story sequences went up to it's closure altogether and explained all the things. Narrative of the whole story's very wise and aristocratic.\nGameplay is another momentous feature of this title. Like it's very focused and noted. I would like to talk about skills of a true Assassin first. So I could see all the true skills of a masterful assassin in this. Just like flawless and compact. This is what makes the combat more winsome. If you teach yourself to use Ezio Auditore's combat skills throughly then you'll be able to inflict flawless execution which would take your combat experience into elegant echelon. About antagonists, you can't kill all the hostiles spontaneously. There are some difference like skill levels. Some hostiles like Brutes, they are very skillful and complex to be eliminated. So some combat situations will be hard for you though. By the way, you can recruit some distressful citizens to your cause through saving them from attackers. Then you can make your own brotherhood. You can use your guild in any combat. You'll be able to recruit over fifteen citizens. Even there are skill ranks for them. Summon them in your conflict and let them aid you with ther skills. So they can uprank and reach the highest rank which is called Assassin.\nAbout map and locations, you'll enjoy wandering around Roma. Because it has been created with very astute minds. Looks so beautiful and detailed than before. Also that's pretty big for you to travel the whole map even with horse rides. In game situations would want you to act more effective to get collectible things around the map. Some of them hidden and some of them kind of visible. This is what gonna keep you busy most of the times.\nAbout outfits and purchasable things, you'll be rewarded with some outfits for completing some actions like getting full synchronization and other events. Some of the outfits you can purchase from Uplay like Ezio's noble attire, Altair's robes and more. With in game currency, you can buy different colored clothes and other swords, daggers, crossbow and more. Even you can upgrade your armor through Leonardo Da Vinci, just like before.\nVisuals are good and decent as this title was released 7 years ago. So don't expect it to be like realistic and intensive. But you'll love it. About characters, facial expressions and moves are improved than before like what we have seen in Assassin's Creed II. About environment, looks rad at night and dazzling at day time.\nDefinitely, this has some fascinating background scores like Echoes of Roman Ruins. Makes you feel like you're back to historical moments. Echoes of Roman Ruins has been given for some peaceful moments like when you're wandering around and having some moments with environments. Besides, all the other musics are perfectly matched with their given situations.\nHaving outstanding performance without any kind of deficiency. Didn't face any bugs, crashes nor any errors till now. I'm playing on Intel Core i7 7700K, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram and getting tenecious 60 FPS with max presets. So for me, it has flawless performance.\nSo guys, I'm genuinely recommending it to all of you. If you love immersive adventures then don't be dummy and let it lift your spirits. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is requisite for all Assassin's Creed lovers. I personally guarantee you that you won't be disappointed if you try this out.", "hours": 45.0, "username": "T'Challa", "products": 69, "early_access": false}

The story behind this game is exceptionally done. Here, Ezio is not as young and naive as in AC II. Although the combat system tends to be uninspiring, since one can beat an entire crowd if they just hold the block button and counter at the right moment, some missions can be extremely difficult. For example, expect to make several attempts at Da Vinci\u2019s missions, as it\u2019s not uncommon to take damage in the arena where the tanks are fighting, rendering 100% synchronization impossible. Furthermore, the player is not able to restart a mission from the last checkpoint. All in all, I found this game to be quite enjoyable, and I believe you will, too.", "hours": 45.5, "user_id": "76561198114612951", "username": "1Danstone1", "products": 168, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "48190", "page": 106, "page_order": 8, "recommended": false, "date": "2015-09-06", "text": "Here ends my personal journey with Assassin's Creed, having completed the trilogy and now Brotherhood.  And what a beast of a game, a series.  Was it worth my time, you ask?  Let's start at the beginning.\nSpace expanded rapidly.  Particles gathered into hydrogen atoms, stars and planets were formed, and Assassin's Creed was made.  I played that game and loved it.  It was impressive technically and visually, on a level that only millions of dollars could produce, and perhaps more astonishing was the total commitment to their freerunning system.  Ubisoft promised players could freely climb and scale virtually any solid object in the game, and I say they knocked it out-of-the-park on their first go.  Not everyone agrees with me.  A lot of folks complained that it was too repetitive (a peeve of mine, but that's another tale).\nCue the sequels and I'm utterly baffled.  You see, freerunning is the CORE of Assassin's Creed, its bread and butter, its heart and soul.  Almost everything you do somehow involves climbing on things.  Taking the original game as a successful prototype, with the primary complaint being that people want more of it, the natural path is to focus on the one thing that defines the game and use it to springboard to something more.  But every game in the series has taken bizarre 90-degree turns that don't add up to anything.  Consider:\n\"There's a rad freerunning system and now you can construct a brothel in your villa!\"\n\"There's a rad freerunning system and now there's a simulated economy!\"\n\"There's a rad freerunning system and now you can play bocce ball with George Washington!\"\n...And the games are praised to high heavens.  Is this what people really want?  It's a crying shame that the core gameplay remains constant while getting buried under a mountain of crap.  Are layered mechanics not more interesting than disconnected ones?  Meanwhile, almost every activity can be reduced to \"go to the waypoint marker and/or beat up some guys\".  The problem is the freerunning, and to some extent the combat, really carries the game.  Your fun is absolutely dependent on whether these two things are compelling enough on their own.\nAnd therein lies the crux of why I think the Assassin's Creed series as a whole, stinks, because they can boiled down to nothing.  \"Go here\" involves holding two buttons and pointing the stick toward the waypoint.  \"Beating up guys\" involves repeatedly pressing attack and occasionally pressing block as an enemy strikes.  Following this strategy will get you through most of the game.  Perhaps one could say the game is just too easy.  I used the stock hidden blades throughout the whole game, and never felt the need to purchase any weapons, upgrades, or gadgets (except for DaVinci's climbing gloves, bless his heart).\nOccassionally you will sense that Assassin's Creed wants to be a stealth game, and I think it could be an outstanding one, except it bungles this as well.  The game falls into the very unforgiving trap of instant failure if you are detected at all, even if you stab a guy through the throat as he glimpses you upon his dying breath.  More perplexing design decisions abound.  Don't get caught freerunning or the Roman Rooftop Gestapo will get you!  Why punish players for climbing and exploring?\nOf course the story context is a monster in itself.  Apparently Ubisoft was so wowed by their own material that they felt it acceptable to ram the story down players' throats.  The sheer quantity and length of cutscenes is unreal.  Now I ain't no literary scholar, but I think the writing throughout the Assassin's Creed series is abysmal.  You spend so much time watching one-dimensional characters standing around yakking endlessly about some garbage you don't care about.  Every other line of dialogue is contrived to get you to \"go\" and \"kill\", and there just isn't a story being told, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't constantly interrupt the game.  You can hardly pick your nose without it bookended by boring cinematics.\nThe main conflict feels equally contrived.  Antagonists are either ridiculously villanous or guilty by association.  Of course you hardly ever see any of the alleged wrongdoing -- you're just told that person X is \"corrupt\" for vague reasons and they have an unfriendly disposition when you meet them in person.  I also can't get past the grand irony of the evil Templars condemned by the rightous \"Assassins\".  They fight back by murdering hundreds of people.  Other moments of brilliance are wasted.  Fallen foes, in their dying moments, try to get you to understand their motivation, their ideology.  But Ezio doesn't care.  He doesn't reflect upon or question his choices.  There's no personal growth; the story takes no risks.  It's just... flat.  The overarching sci-fi plot is actually quite interesting but so sparse that it hardly matters.\nI probably ought to explain my beef with cutscenes.  They never sit right with me, but they are the most obvious way to tell a story.  The nature of authorship is such that it conflicts with input from the audience.  The more input, the less control the author has.  Thus, taking control away from players is the most direct approach.  I'm fine with this, but I begin to take issue when cutscenes are used as a crutch for sloppy game design.\nThere's a depressing trend among modern games to take the mechanics and tease out narrow, compartmentalized segments of gameplay, which are then shuffled throughout the experience.  The result is a game which is ultimately simpler, more predictable, and presumably easier to develop.  The first example that comes to mind is the Tomb Raider reboot, and the game suffers for it.  You are either climbing things or shooting things, but never both.  However, Tomb Raider is somewhat forgiven because it smoothly transitions between gameplay segments with smart level design, pacing, context, etc.  Assassin's Creed, on the other hand, glues together disjointed segments of gameplay with cutscenes, jerking you all over the place.  Cutscene - CHASE - cutscene - KILL - cutscene - FOLLOW - cutscene - KILL... I hate this.  It's like Warioware without the creativity (or fun).  This is how you can tell a game's design is oversimplified.\nIf you've never played an Assassin's Creed game, it may be too late for you.  There was a day when the freerunning was cutting-edge and the sci-fi story was a surprise.  My advice is to play the original because it's the most \"pure\" experience and the medival setting really fits.  Otherwise, ask yourself \"can the freerunning carry my enjoyment for another 10-20 hours?\".  Gamers will always mentally strip away a game's fluff and reduce its moving parts to an abstract model, and at this point Assassin's Creed immediately goes stale.  It just doesn't have enough complexity to last beyond the initial novelty.  Sure, the game is punctuated by interesting moments in its enormous story, but these moments are mere hydrogen atoms in the vastness of space.", "hours": 10.4, "username": "Firetiger", "products": 255, "early_access": false}

A Clearer picture, constant 60 FPS, and almost no game crashes has been so far my best experience on PC with an Ubisoft game that I've played outside of South Park: The Stick of Truth.\nGraphics: They are a step up from ACII, with more colors, a clearer picture, and more detail on everything from buildings and architecture to character models. Some common citizens as well as the new assassin recruits/their faces, however, look a little too low poly and low rez as far as the game world is around them, but this is just a minor concern. The game, for the most part, makes Rome look stunning, even by 2015 standards (if you have an open mind for older titles, anyway). I did have a weird problem with citizens/guards popping in right in front of me, as they took longer to load, and they scared the heck outta me when that happened, but this didn't take away much from my experience.\nStory/Plot/Setting: It picks up right where ACII leaves up and continues to be compelling and engaging. Ezio is still ever the charming personality. The people he interacts with are, for the most part, well written and interesting. Ezio continues to learn and grow as a character. The new assassin recruits make for an interesting side game as well as a great story mechanic. The side missions expand on the story even further, especially the Christina Memories. You spend more time as Desmond in this game than you did in ACII, but not enough to take away from the experience as Ezio. The ending is an interesting plot device to push the story even further and ends on an outrageous cliffhanger.\nGameplay: It's the AC gameplay we all knew and loved from the 2nd game, with better platforming and new side missions. The Assassin recruits are simple to handle, though not very engaging. A lot of the side missions that you may or may not have loved, like contracts, races, the like, have returned. Collectibles have also returned. However there is a lack of the puzzles you did in ACII. The Romulus missions work similar to the Assassin Tombs in ACII, which I loved! I beat the game in 26 hours, about 4 hours shy of the time I spent in ACII, but if you're a completionist or enjoyed a lot of the side stuff that ACII had to offer you could easily spend more time than that with this game. There is also the \"investments\" in stores outside of buying them, but considering that the community has moved on to the newer titles, they don't really matter much.\nI did not play Multiplayer so I am not sure how well this game has retained a community but keep in mind this game was released in 2011.\nBut I highly recommend playing this version if you have not played the series before.

If you are new to the series, I suggest to play with Assassin's Creed\u2122: Director's Cut Edition first because of the story.\nWhere to begin... History is playground.\nThis game is one of the most enjoyable game I've ever played. The music is a masterpiece, I will buy the OST on Google Play. The cities are full of life, the environment and graphics feels real. It is now impossible for me to go outside without mentally assessing climbing routes and synchronization points over all the buildings in the historical downtown of my city.\nBrotherhood only gives a small extra to Assassin's Creed 2. I often felt this is AC2, but thanks to the small extras this is a step forward.\nEzio is probably one of the best and well-written characters in gaming history, I was a little disappointed in AC2 last mission. After perfectly built large cities Ubisoft made a mistake to let Ezio go to \"Rome\", which was only a limited wall, a tiny part of the Vatican.\nLuckily Ubisoft finished what they begun, and we got a beautiful ancient Rome.\nThis is not just a game. The cities has historical buildings, events, and people. In the game you can access information about the characters' life, the story of the place you are. You can find hidden signs to explore \"the truth\". You can access side missions, and you can collect and purchase items.\nAll things considered this game is probably one of the best of the Assassin's Creed games, I highly recommend to buy it.

The gameplay in Brotherhood is nigh identical to that of Assassin's Creed 2, and that sadly also means that they did not bother fixing some of the flaws that that game had.\nA core part of what makes the Assassin's Creed games is the parkour system. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop can be a real joy, and many of the missions also have lengthy parkour elements. The system is not without its flaws though, the game sometimes has a hard time telling where you want to jump, and decides to jump to something to the side rather than straight ahead, resulting in some embarrassing deaths. It's at least not as bad as it was in Assassin's Creed 1, but there is still a lot of room for improvement here. The game designers also decided to lock the camera at some points during these parkour segments, but as movement is relative to the camera, when the camera locks at an awkward angle (and it always does), jumping in the right direction becomes harder than it should be.\nOne flaw that seem to have become bigger with the introduction of some new elements is the problem with the inconsistent controls. Most games would simply have a \"use\" key that you would press when using levers, opening doors, talking to people, looting bodies  and opening chests, but Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has 3 different keys that is being used here. E, Shift and the dreaded \"any key\" (which can be a hassle if you're close to the object and intend to run in any direction). And it's not entirely consistent about which key you're supposed to use at any given moment. This is made even more annoying by the fact that tutorial message that tell you very basic things keep popping up through the entire game, which covers the button prompts. Attacking is also a bit inconsistent.  For most attacks, the left mouse button is used, like in any other game, but when using cannons (and other more exotic mounted weapons), it's suddenly the right mouse button that is used instead. This inconsistency makes no sense, as the left mouse button is not used at all during these segments. When mounting or dismounting things (boats, horses & cannons) there is again an inconsistency in regards to what button you're supposed to press. Shift, space and the left mouse button are all used for this. Finally, when using the crossbow or pistol you suddenly aim with WASD and can't control the camera at all, which makes those weapons really awkward to use.\nThe story is for the most part quite nice, for an action game. What's going on makes sense within the confines of the universe and most of the characters also behave in a relatively believable way. The voice actors that voice the major characters do a good job at portraying them. Sadly the later parts of the game feel rushed and the story end up feeling a bit disjointed towards the end, jumping from place to place with no logical transition. It felt like I missed several cutscenes during the final 2 hours of the game. The level design of these parts also show signs of being rushed, as I found 3 spots where I got stuck (without looking for them) during chapter 7 alone. Getting stuck in the level geometry is generally a sign of lack of playtesting.\nFinally, the economy system is just as broken in Brotherhood as it was in Assassin's Creed 2. The game showers you with money as soon as you've started to make a few investments, and money ends up being a non-issue, to the point where it might as well not be there in the first place.\nIn closing, I find it very hard to actually recommend Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to anyone. While it has its share of good elements, it also has quite a few problems that make what otherwise would have been a good action game a so-so one. There are just too many better games out there for Brotherhood to be worth playing, unless you're just playing it to get the complete Assassin's Creed story.", "hours": 19.4, "username": "Fnord", "products": 3511, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 114, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-06-30", "text": "Like its predecessor, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a better game than its predecessor. It too, has numerous flaws and many shortcomings. While there is one game in this series that really stands out, this one, again, isn't it.\nWhat you have here is polished, prettier Assassin's Creed II. I'm not really sure how I logged 117 hours on it. I think some of it was me trying to convince myself that there was more to this game than there really is.\nIn contrast to ACII's sprawling-conspiracy-web story spanned across several cities and decades, here we get a more tension-based story based in one city over about 5 years.\nThat change is for the better, though the story doesn't improve -- we still get the same absurd plans.\nBefriend the courtesans then use them to acquire an outfit to follow a chest of money back to a party to kill 'The Banker' to cut off Cesare's funds to stop his war effort? What? Get a key to the Castello di Sant'Angelo by befriending the thieves so you can steal outfits to a play so you can sneak into the play so you can save an actor Cesare wants dead so the actor can give you the key? Again, what? The plot is nonsense.\nFight Cesare to the death of his neck armor. His neck armor is endless.\nParticularly painful, and Assassin's Creed as a series is often guilty of this, are the missions where you are assigned the task of killing the primary antagonists early in the game. It is so obvious that you will not succeed in this task and that it will turn into a 'mission-gone wrong' situation that it's painful.\nClumsily extending 1 memory in 1 sequence into 5 memories to make the game seem longer than it really is -- pretty common for this game.\nThe soundtrack, while it does use some of AC2's great tracks, develops its own style. This style is sort of a lower, thumping, tension-building sort of music. It works, the game succeeds at developing its own atmosphere apart from AC2.\nVisually, the game is still gorgeous. The beautiful color saturation and the way the whites and reds stand out in this 1500s depiction of Rome really add to the atmosphere and feel of the game. Rome is great to look at.\nThere is plenty of side content, most of it fun. Christina missions fill in some blank spaces about Ezio's past with Christina in AC2. Leonardo's war machines are entertaining but ridiculous -- destroy Leonardo's machine gun, tank, and air-cannon to stop the Borgia from using them. The followers of Romulus missions are similar to the crypt-exploration missions from AC2. There are also many thief, courtesan, and assassin contracts to undertake.\nSo there is definitely plenty to do. I should warn that most of these things simply have little replay value. The novelty and enjoyment of completing these tasks wears off the first time you do them.\nThe reason for this is that the game is incredibly easy and there is not much way of making it harder. Assassin's Creed has always lacked difficulty settings. In Brotherhood, especially, they would be appreciated.\nThe simple addition of chain kills makes the game so ridiculously easy that some form of higher difficulty is really needed to justify playing through this game again. This is even without using your assassin recruits.\nHowever, higher difficulties often involves taking different strategies, new approaches, rethinking how you play the game. Clearly, every task in this game was designed for there to be 1 way to complete it. It's not really all that open in what approach you take.\nSo, in the end, what we have here is a beautiful expansion pack to Assassin's Creed II that outdoes Assassin's Creed II in nearly every way. One can excuse it's horrible story because, well, every game in this series prior to this one also has a horrible story! What did you expect? Pick it up for $10 or less for a good time.", "hours": 117.9, "user_id": "76561198015641338", "username": "JUB JUB", "products": 215, "early_access": false}

The recruits provide a lot of help during combat and I sometimes think that  they are better assasins than me.

This is very different from the trailer where Ezio have different looking recruits holding different weapons on his side. The main storyline is pretty short compared to that of AC2. In order to compensate this, ACB has a ridicuously large amount of side missions for players to experience, although some are not that fun to play. Assasinating in ACB is easier compared to AC2 as players can easily use the crossbow and hidden balde poison to kill targets from distance without being detected.

But I cannot recommend this installment in the series like I did its predecessor.\nThe real shame here is that Rome has none of the charm of AC2's brilliant levels. Where Florence was towering and beautiful, Venice labyrinthine and mysterious, and Tuscany open and warm, Rome is just a dissapointment. It feels lifeless and indistinct, even small at times.\nAdding to the problem is AssCreeBro's story. AC2 got it right, by telling a straightforward story about the protagonist's journey from simple vengeance to deciphering his role in a larger mystery. AssCreeBro falters, picking up immediately after the admitedly weak finale of AC2 and going nowhere slowly. After the Borgia launch a counter attack that an idiot should have seen coming a mile away, Ezio heads to Rome to regain the Apple and thwart his enemies. The plan includes rebuilding the Assassin order, which plays out in a profoundly boring way. You meet bland, faceless citizens who are under attack, save them, then recruit them to your cause, where they become bland, faceless assassins who do nothing of plot significance. You'll slowly \"liberate\" Rome by climbing towers (and setting them on fire for some reason), and then buying all the shops in the area.\nAssCreeBro adds a few features (like the Assassin recruits). The disappointing part is that most of those new features are bland or unnecessary. The investment minigame seems to exist only to fuel itself. The missions you send your recruits on earn a tiny amount of gold and do nothing for the plot. New \"full syncronization\" challenges have been added to every mission, further restricting the way you experience this open world adventure (usually in arbitrary ways that don't make any sense and often with bugs).\nWithout the charm of the setting or story, issues that have plagued Assassin's Creed gameplay since the original begin to take center stage. The controls are atrocious. On PC, the stronger option is to use an Xbox controller rather than wrestle with the horrible keyboard/mouse options. On the controller, one must hold the left trigger to perform all the most common actions. The X and A buttons on the controller are each map to dozens of different (often contradictory) context sensitive commands, and other buttons are under-utilized or outright ignored. Keep in mind, none of these issues is new to AssCreeBro, its just that without the distractions these issues swiftly come to dominate the experience.\nIts not that AssCreeBro is bad - its just not good enough to overlook the flaws.

the Ezio we see at the beginning to the game is still the same old Ezio we see when the credits roll.\u00a0 Admittedly it would have been a tall order for Brotherhood to raise the stakes for Ezio relative to the events in AC2.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately this leaves the events that transpire in Brotherhood feeling a bit like an epilogue to the 'main story' occurring in AC2.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn Brotherhood we once again find ourselves fighting the Borgias although these particular members of the family seemingly pop up from nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0From a historical perspective it makes sense that these Borgias would have been a threat to the fictional world of Ezio, but in terms of gameplay it would have been nice to at least have some reference to these folks in AC2, so as to maintain series continuity (granted I do understand this sort of series planning doesn't often happen that far in advance).\u00a0 The main Borgia from AC2 does makes an appearance in Brotherhood as well, but it\u2019s only slightly more than a couple of cameos.\u00a0 After all the time spent in AC2 tracking this man down, Ezio actually has very little to do with how that thread resolves itself.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a bit disappointing.\u00a0 As it is the newly introduced Borgias wind up feeling like the \"bad guys du jour\".\u00a0\u00a0The motivation for fighting them is provided clearly enough; it's just the enemies themselves seem to be randomly inserted into the mythos (unless you were already acquainted with the history of the Borgias in which case, yes I suppose this decision makes total sense.)\n\u00a0\nSo let's talk about gameplay, because for the most part it is absolutely brilliant in Brotherhood.\u00a0\u00a0Once again we are treated to the delightfully smooth responsiveness we saw in AC2, and maybe it's just me, but I feel like general mechanics and responsiveness have been even further improved upon here.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have nearly as many moments in which I felt Ezio jumped in completely unexpected directions.\u00a0\u00a0Wall jumps are smoother and easier to execute reliably.\u00a0\u00a0Not only that but the new gameplay elements introduced in Brotherhood, make the game all that much more enjoyable.\u00a0\u00a0Horseback combat is the best that it\u2019s ever been in the series, and horseback assassinations feel extremely satisfying.\u00a0\u00a0The introduction of kill streaks makes standard combat even more dynamic and interesting.\u00a0\u00a0The crossbow is a fantastic addition for stealth kills at a distance.\u00a0And then of course there is the titular Brotherhood itself.\u00a0\u00a0The 'game within the game' of building and managing a stable of Assassin's under your command is enjoyable and well executed.\u00a0\u00a0Once you have a few talented assassins at your beck and call, it simultaneously introduces some game breaking elements and counterintuitively an undeniable feeling of exhilaration that comes with having a badass ninja posse at your disposal.\u00a0You'd rather not deal with the gate guards in your way?\u00a0\u00a0Just whistle for your homeboys to jump in with blades flashing and smoke bombs flying.\u00a0\u00a0Don't feel like slugging it out with charging cavalry?\u00a0\u00a0Call in an arrow storm.\u00a0\u00a0The brotherhood introduces a really fun mechanic to play around with, which actually does help to further the narrative of Ezio transitioning from rank and file soldier to master assassin within the order.\n\u00a0\nSo while there is an overwhelming amount of good involved in terms of gameplay, there's also a dash of the questionable.\u00a0\u00a0This is the first game in the series to introduce the concept of 'memory synchronization'.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially this means that you have to play missions in a certain way, or meet certain objectives during the mission, to reach full synchronization (read: full completion percentage).\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the full synchronization criterion makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0\"Kill only the main target\" or \"Kill your target with the hidden blade\" for example.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, that all sounds reasonably assassin-ish, and I can buy in to that.\u00a0\u00a0But sometimes the goals feel tacked on and arbitrary at best (\"Kill at least three enemy types with their own weapon \", \" Kick your target\"), and at worst they introduce an artificial sense of difficulty that would not exist otherwise (\"Do not take damage while in the tank. \" \u2026 a tank which happens to be an unresponsive heap of fetid frustration.\u00a0\u00a0That's right Leonardo, if you're reading this; your tank is more worthless than a bag of farts at the bank).\u00a0\u00a0While the Order of Assassin's preaches that, \"Nothing is True,\u00a0\n, the game itself tells you in no uncertain terms that, \"No in fact you're\npermitted to accomplish this objective in one specific prescribed way\".\u00a0\u00a0It's not that memory synchronization is game breaking or anything, but it does take some getting used to (or potentially a\n\u00a0of getting used to if you\u2019re going for 100% completion).\n\u00a0\nLastly be aware that there is\u00a0\n\u00a0to do in this game.\u00a0\u00a0This can be good or bad depending on how you feel about \"artificially extending the experience\".\u00a0\u00a0So you've finished the story?\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t think so partner, go help Leonardo with this whole War Machine thing.\u00a0\u00a0You're done with that?\u00a0\u00a0Better figure out what the Cult of Romulus is up to!\u00a0\u00a0Romulus is in remission?\u00a0\u00a0Better go help some courtesans now!\u00a0\u00a0Whoa, don't forget about those regression memories with Maria!\u00a0\u00a0Have you completed any guild challenges?\u00a0\u00a0Well get on it!\u00a0\u00a0Don't forget to explore modern day Monteriggioni!\u00a0\u00a0No wait, where are you going?!\u00a0 You need to find and solve the Mystery of the Glyphs!\u00a0\u00a0And on and on \u2026\u00a0Personally I don't mind this sort of thing.\u00a0\u00a0AC: Brotherhood is a fun world, and it's fun to just goof around while completing some missions at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, if you feel like the description above sounds like a grinding slog tacked on purely for the purpose of lengthening the game, well you might have a bad time in Brotherhood (unless you opt to ignore side missions completely which is also perfectly valid)\n\u00a0\nOverall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood effectively expands and builds upon the Assassin's Creed universe with some really great gameplay choices.\u00a0\u00a0While the story lacks some of the overarching grandeur we saw in AC2, it is still a nice expansion upon the story of Ezio and his exploits in Rome.", "hours": 67.7, "username": "nullPointer", "products": 573, "early_access": false}

Set in Rome several years after the events in AC:II, Brotherhood expands on the story surrounding the Borgia and their attempt to take the city (and then the entirety of Italy).\nPersonally, I found the storyline uninteresting and failed to drive me to move forward in the game compared to II where I was riveted the whole way through. I think this is in part marred by the introduction of the extra feats you need to complete to achieve a '100% Sync%' on missions, you find yourself concentrating more on some of the (sometimes ridiculous) extra criteria that have been set for you rather than the mission and it's impact on Ezio, Rome and the larger world.\nRome itself is quite possibly one of the dullest settings in an Assassin's Creed game, players were spoilt with the multiple venues of II and if you move onto Revelations, Constantinople has more character and charm about it than Rome does. The Lairs of Romulus add in an extra spark to an otherwise boring landscape, but again the 100% sync challenges may mean you want to speed through these locations instead of taking them in fully.\nCombat hasn't really evolved from the second game, you'll find a majority of fights easy and with the added bonus of being able to call upon your own team of assassin's, any fight where your seriously outnumbered can be evened out in a matter of moments. The fact that you are recruiting assassin's and sending them out on varying missions really does help you feel that you are being instrumental in helping to establish a proper order in Italy and will leave a legacy in Ezio's name.\nBrotherhood can be considered a low point in the series, the game feels like they've tried to cram too much into it in a short space of time, not really developing the new features fully, making the experience a somewhat stop/start affair. There is still plenty to keep die hard Assassin's Creed fans occupied and there is enough lore here to warrant playing through the game to keep abreast of the whole arcing storyline that runs through the AC series. Worth picking up when on offer, just don't expect it to light up your life.\n(Ignore the 230 hrs played, there was a glitch in the matrix that added 180hrs to my play time.)", "hours": 230.4, "username": "DeeFunct", "products": 546, "early_access": false}

Gaining control over the city actually feels like something that matters, as opposed to this vague assassins vs templars thing that has lasted for three straight games and still never gets anywhere.\n+ Made horses more important and can now ride inside city.  Can assassinate while jumping from a horse for example.\n+ Rome is huge and there are plenty of things to see and do.  Some side missions take you to other areas of Italy for a nice change of pace once and a while.\n- Trying to execute certain moves is messy sometimes.  For example, trying to do an assassination mid air will sometimes just cause you to open your parachute and screw everything up.  Or from a horse you may just end up falling on them without a kill.  I think it boils down to too many 'moves' and not enough buttons for them all.  Stuff like this is rare but it happens enough that it will cause you to fail a mission more than once.\n- Constant prompts reminding you how to execute certain moves/jumps and tell you what to do next.  This was borderline too hand-holdy in ACII, but in Brotherhood it goes far beyond that line.\n- The modern day story is still shallow, confusing, and poorly written.\n- The events in the last hour or so of the game.  It doesn't even feel fair to use the whole \"to say it was rushed would be an understatement\" cliche, because wow.\n- Exclusive DLC STILL only availible on PS3 after 4 years. Go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourself, Ubisoft.\nOther thoughts:\nI do like the recuit system but it would be nice to have more interaction with them.  Ezio is rebuilding the brotherhood, and is training and fighting alongside these recruits for years.  It'd be nice to see some sort of bond or something forming between them.  They end up feeling like just another button to press.\nHaving treasure maps that help find some of the scattered collectibles is nice.  Normally I wouldn't bother with them, but if I'm in an area and notice one is nearby, I'll feel more impelled to look for it.  Although, from what I noticed, they are still meaningless.  I collected 10 feathers, which are important enough to have their own drop off point (and are important to the family which is brought up in ACII), and when I got them all?  Nothing.\nIt sounds like a contradiction: how can a game have so much stuff to do, but end up feeling so repetitive?  Not repetitive in the AC1 way; that was literally the same 4 tasks over and over.  The missions in ACII and Brotherhood do feel varied, but after a couple hundred or so missions of sneaking and/or stabbing, you start getting the thousand yard stare.  You always have plenty to do but it wears thin. I'm sure the new direction Black Flag took helped freshen things up, but that's two whole games from now.  Woof.\nAll in all AC:Brotherhood was an enjoyable game and I think it's easy enough to recommend for anyone to play.  I just think I'll be taking a nice long break before even considering playing AC:Revelations.", "hours": 40.1, "user_id": "76561197992684539", "username": "smooks", "products": 643, "early_access": false}

I did notice a new day/night lighting cycle, and greater variety in character models around the city.\nHowever, the gameplay has been tuned significantly. I found the free-running much smoother in this game; I spent less time jumping accidentally against walls that I didn't mean to climb. Brotherhood seems to know where I want to go much better than AC2 did.\nBut mechanics aside, it's the new mission structure that really impressed me. Brotherhood takes a lesson from the Grand Theft Auto series -- the city of Rome is huge, and there's always something nearby that you can get involved with. The major missions come more naturally; you don't feel funneled towards them in Brotherhood like you do in AC2. You can take them on early, or muck around in the city for a long while before addressing the major story.\nAnd - the story. The Assassin's Creed storyline is still wonderful, and improves in Brotherhood. The cut scenes are well-balanced so they don't dominate gameplay. The body models are expressive and evocative, and the voice acting is excellent. I find that I really care about these characters and what's happening in the story. Also, Brotherhood really improves Desmond's meta-story.\nLast comment - Assassin's Creed has the best cities in video games, hands down. Brotherhood takes place almost exclusively in Rome during the renaissance. The city and nearby countryside is massive! But the attention to detail is remarkable. You see different NPC character models in different parts of the city, and they change between night and day. People mill about in a realistic fashion; some have places to be, others chat in the shade. The ambient noise is fantastic. And never a loading screen as you move about.\nSo... Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is over 4 years old as I write this, so I doubt I'll convince anyone to play it who hasn't already. But it looks great, plays great on PC with a controller, and really delivers a satisfying experience. It's definitely worth your time.", "hours": 36.2, "username": "7grain", "products": 355, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Takes everything good from the previous games and just improves upon it, with perfected details and stunning graphics & environments. The combat is excellent, fluid, and has been given more complexity and variety - even the story is incredible. There is so much nuance, and a ton of humor and clever lines to boot. Especially due to the last level of the game, I have gained so much more interest in Desmond's story. Excellent game, the best of the first three in the series.\nIt still has a few minor flaws and some unnecessary/pointless game components, like the purchasing of buildings (which made completionist status take SO MANY HOURS LONGER >:(  ) but that barely damages it, compared to how much they have done right and improved upon. The new character customization options are nice touches, although largely cosmetic and pointless. There are some sweet easter eggs in this game as well - like a Raiden costume from Metal Gear Solid. Why in the world did they include that? Lol.\nThe story is much better, clearer, and more relatable than the previous ones; it is better paced and much more cinematic. The best parts of the game are, yet again, the Truth puzzles hidden throughout the game - they are so intriguing, so complex, so mysterious and revealing simultaneously, and sometimes crazily challenging. I loved that part of the game the most. It was also my favorite part from ACII, so I am surprised that the devs were able to outdo themselves and make an even better set of puzzles than before.\nSadly, the multiplayer community is dying, and it remained a bit difficult to find even a single match - I waited for 10 minutes just searching for a match. But when I got to play, it was a ton of hectic, fast-paced, heart-pounding fun. The only other big negative is the UPlay software requirement and overlay, but it's not too much of a bother to me. Except for when it kept my game from EVER LAUNCHING. I had to run the game in compatibility mode for Windows 98 to get it to work - I have no idea why it would work in \"Windows 98\" but not Windows 8.

You can upgrade local buisinesses in the world, take out guard outposts and burn them to the ground, and  run a local assassin guild you build from the ground up. Among many other things. The game is also noticeably harder and basically expects that you already played through AC2 before this one. It also features V/R missions like Metal Gear Solid so you can test your skills in the combat and stealth challenges.

I'm not a fan of the lengthy escorts or tailing missions of which there seemed to be too many. There was also too much trial & error, in part due to the absence of mission critical info,  which led to IMHO unnecessary repetition due to the console checkpoint save system.\nI liked the 15th/16th century depiction of Rome though.

When you lock on an NPC, or PC in multiplayer, it actually LOCKS. This was the only gripe I had with AC2's gameplay and it's been remedied.\nYou might have noticed that I've logged almost 500 hours in this game. The continuing story is great but it doesn't have THAT much replay value. No, that time was mostly spent in Wanted mode multiplayer (MP). And what a multiplayer it was/is. I've never played anything like it. This game's MP changed my view on something. I once read a review of Mass Effect 3 in which the writer stated that he loved ME3 multiplayer but didn't care about the story at all. I was somehow annoyed by this. Even if you hated the ending (I didn't) how can you play a Mass Effect game at all without caring about the story?! That game's world building was on an epic scale! But then I started playing AC:B's MP. And I understood. I actually started because I saw my brother playing Wanted mode and I thought it looked cool. I was still on AC2 storyline at the time so I skipped Story Mode at first and went straight to MP. I logged a cool hundred hours of that before completing AC2 and moving into AC:B. I played one hundred hours of this game's MP before even touching it's single player story.\nAnyway, the MP player base is still active to this day but you won't find me there. A Ubisoft bug wiped my XP progress and skill unlocks on my MP profile one day so I'd have to start from the bottom. This doesn't appeal to me one bit. Silver lining though, this gave me the impetus to uninstall this game and move on to the rest of my library.\nTL;DR If you get a chance, try to play some MP Wanted mode.

It's not terribly worse, but it doesn't really add anything. It continues the adventures of Ezio Auditore: the renaissance-y murder specialist and Desmond. Desmond deserves no description as he is blander than wet graham crackers. This might sound like I'm jumping on the Hate-Desmond bandwagon. I am because said bandwagon is warm and has free wifi and is GENERALLY CORRECT.\nThis game is good if your a fan of the series and curious to see what happens to Ezio, but it doesn't do anything that interesting or new.\nAs usual it adds some new weapons and a new setting. They have replaced the two fairly large cities of Florence and Venice with the pretty large city of Rome. You went to Rome briefly in the last game for an oddly linear mission, but it's back and fleshed out into a totally new map.\nRome is neat, considering it has it's fair share of cool landmarks. The Colosseum comes to mind. Rome is one of the only things that is new though. You still follow the same group of modern day people: Lucy (who falls a bit deep into the uncanny valley), the british guy and the other woman. You still follow Ezio (now a bit older, with a beard, but still as spritely as ever.) The bad guys are still the Borgias and you still take down key members of the family in a quite brutal game of Family Feud.\nMoney is back too. This time you have to renovate all of Rome, which leads me to ask how the f*ck does Ezio have permission to fix the goddamn Colosseum.\nAnyway, the game's pretty good. If you plan on playing the Assassin's Creed series then I suggest picking this one up, at least to fill in the story holes. It's pretty fun, but doesn't do much. The name is a key indicator. It's not Assassin's Creed III (that's a different game). It's not a straight sequel. It's more of a time occupier.\nHowever, it's pretty good.", "hours": 30.3, "user_id": "76561198080021055", "username": "Neon Jesus", "products": 290, "early_access": false}

So here we go:\nI love the Assassin's Creed series. I played the first AC about seven years ago, and I played it nonstop. The basic idea of AC is that you are and assassin, and you have a city as your assassination-playground, usually multiple locations. You start the game as Desmond, a guy who uses a machine called the Animus to shoot back in time to his ancestors' history. This is accomplished from the Animus being able to use his mind as a channel for those ancestors' memories.\nThen, you are his ancestor, an assassin. and you have to kill things. The story is usually deep and intriguing, and it brings you along, and the gameplay of it is awesome too. And then you can just do random things as sidequests, usually pickpocketing, or another assassination target, stuff like that.\nYou have two profiles: Low profile, where you don't draw attention, and just push past people, or walk. Then High profile, by holding right trigger, where then you start running and you can parkour, fight, shove through people, and sprint.\nThe combat is fun, and the sneaky-assassinating is satisfying.

If you have not played Assassin\u2019s Creed II, I highly recommend that you start there, as Brotherhood and Revelations are direct continuations of Ubisoft\u2019s 2009 predecessor. While Brotherhood is a sequel of a sequel, it continues to bring multiple quality elements to the table. This game is, without a doubt, my personal favourite in the series. Like the original installment, Brotherhood is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. One that you will not be disappointed in.\nBrotherhood follows Assassin\u2019s Creed II nicely, and cleanly picks up where the last left off. Desmond flees the scene of the latest Templar attack, and follows his team to Monteriggioni: their new hideout. Desperate to locate the Apple of Eden, in hopes of preventing a global disaster that had been predicted to happen later on in the year, Desmond rushes back into his genetic memory.\nFor Ezio, it is 1499, and he still cannot explain what he had seen inside the vault. Unfortunately, he is not given much time to mull it over before the actions of the Templars push him back into action. He spends most of the game struggling to cripple the Borgia influence in the capital, and then begins the process of training other Assassin\u2019s to aid him.\nAllow me to start off this section of the review by stating that Brotherhood is a huge game, offering more content than Assassin's Creed II. There are a lot of places to explore, both above and below ground. While some players share the mindset that \"more isn't always better\", I am a firm believer that the fans of the beloved assassin Ezio Auditore will have a blast checking out this game... Especially taking into consideration that there is a huge pool of returning characters, including Leonardo DaVinci and Machiavelli.\nThere are a number of recognizable, yet staple mechanics worth mentioning, that have been recycled in Brotherhood: The original (if not improved) free-running system, eagle-vision, hidden messages, looting, buying, and investing. Furthermore, Brotherhood keeps the modernized and improved quest system from its predecessor, which permits Ezio to hire courtesans, thieves or mercenaries.\nThe combat aspects of Brotherhood are mostly recognizable from Assassin's Creed II. You can still cycle through your weapons, and choose whether or not you want to execute a clumbsy public chase, or a stealthy and well-planned kill. Combat aesthetics are gorgeous, and make just about any fight seem brutal and bloody. Like it's predecessor, weapons and armor can be both obtained and repaired at blacksmith shops - Each offering their own selection of kill animations.\nHowever, there are also new aspects of combat. For instance, mounted combat is possible. While running through crowds and across rooftops is entirely possible, Brotherhood now offers the option of horseback riding through cities (once the stables have been purchased), permitting the player to jump from a horse, and straight into an assassination.\nLeonardo DaVinci has a bigger role in this game, along with optional DLC. In fact, he offers stand-alone quests that require Ezio to go after his four war machines in order to lessen the Borgia's military strength. While getting to each of Leonardo's inventions might seem a bit repetitive at times, the objective following locating the machine is always exceptionally diverse. No two missions to destroy Leonardo's inventions are the same.\nFinally, I  saved the best implementation for last. The Assassin's Guild. Ezio is eventually able to recruit civilians, and train them up by sending them on their own quests, to become assassins. Once they have been obtained, they can be called upon to assist Ezio in combat so long as they are not deployed on a mission. While they are extremely powerful, I thought it was a lot of fun to recruit and train them, and I guarantee that you will likely feel the same.\nIf I am not mistaken, the controls are entirely identical to the setup in Assassin\u2019s Creed II. You still cannot re-arrange your buttons, though I guarantee that playing with a gamepad will be much more friendly than playing with a mouse and keyboard.\nLike the previous establishments, Brotherhoods targeting remains a bit on the tricky side. You can\u2019t ever be 100% certain that you will hit your target, but it is something that can still be worked around. However, from time to time you might still end up changing your camera angle, and inadvertently kill a civilian or something, oops!\nBrotherhood offers beautiful graphics that focus heavily on its environment. Virtually every area has been polished to reflect the games atmosphere. I\u2019ve said it a million times before, and I\u2019ll say it again: It is really hard to nit-pick this aspect of the game, because the visuals are so fine-tuned.\nHaving played II, Brotherhood, and Revelations - It is my firm opinion that Brotherhood offers the best of music and voice tracks. Ubisoft continues to uphold the tradition of combining dramatic scores of music to assassinations, making the experience more enjoyable for the player. Subtitles are still an option, and a huge help when it comes to fully understanding what is being said - I encourage you to use them for your own benefit. As always, the sounds only add to the atmosphere of the game, and in the case of Brotherhood: It is extremely well done.\nIn my own opinion, Brotherhood has the highest replay value in the entire series. It introduces so many miscellaneous objectives, that the game never truly feels boring. While replay value is entirely dependent on the player, I am confident enough to say that any fan of Assassin\u2019s Creed will want to play this one again.", "hours": 59.3, "username": "Foreverlore", "products": 148, "found_funny": 5, "early_access": false}

I was in it for the story for the most part, so I tried to beat the story missions as in order as possible. The combat is pretty much identical to AC2 but with much cleaner mechanics. I didn't play around with the weapons much and mostly just stuck with the hidden blades. The combos are always satisfying when they connect especially when landing an execution chain on multiple enemies.\nAs usual, the voice acting and dialogue is excellent as AC goes . The cutscenes and scenery in general is awesome, with great attentions to detail in reconstructing the textures and landscapes. It really feels like being in the renaissance! The maps were very detailed and well put together so you rarely take the same paths twice, if ever. The ability to call and ride horses instantly everywhere makes getting around on roads and sidewalks a breeze no matter how many npc's are walking around.\nThere's still a lot of repetition in mission events, go here, go there, stab someone, run away, hide etc. That aside, it's definitely a game series worth playing and I'm gonna get on AC Revelations tonight!\nAssassins Creed Brotherhood Prof Points: 8.2741", "hours": 40.7, "username": "(-WA-) Prof. Pocket \u2122", "products": 508, "early_access": false}

Ezio is driven away from his home Monteriggioni vila, and travels to the Rome to stop the Templars. When he infiltrates Rome he quickly finds himself in difficult possition as the assassin brotherhood is weakened and the usual suspects refuse to help him. Ezio regains influence for assassins, rebuilds weakened assassin brotherhood and becomes the Grand Master of the brotherhood. Your quest might seem simple, to regain stolen Eden's Apple from vicious templar Cesare Borgia, but it's never that easy, especially when your enemy is a templar. You get to see city of Rome, lots of memorable locations, and immerse yourself in another incredible chapter of Ezio's life.\nThe gameplay doesn't seem like it was improved whole lot, like transition from first game to second, however you're given few new tools to dispose of your enemies. You now have crossbow so you can assassinate your targets 2 rooftops away quickly and silently. What I really wanted since 2nd game was carry an axe for fights, even though it's not elegant weapon for an assassin. The biggest improvement in this installment was the intern system. The intern-assassins can do your assassinations for you, that gives them experience and eventually they graduate from assassin school and become real assassins. The gameplay didn't change much from 2nd game but it's not a bad thing considering it did pretty good job improving rough angles.  The one thing that's worth mentioning is execution system, where you can go on endless kill streak after successful counter attack. This thing was so fun I couldn't stop doing it till the very end of the game. Overally gameplay is smoother version of the 2nd installment which works really well.\nWhat I really disliked about the game was 3rd party DRM system called Uplay.

The added Economics allows for lots of money to be made and spent in Roma. This just builds on the ability in the previous game to earn and spend money and puts that to work on a grander scale.\nThe added abilities, weapons, and use of the syncing percentage really shine in this game. I found myself using the crossbow alot more than I thought I would and not just out of neccesity but actual enjoyment. Leveling up you own assassins within your guild and using them in various ways allowed for more interesting encounters with enemies and missions. Having missions have an optional objectives/constraints to get a sync percentage made had me retrying missions all the time to achieve that percentage.

It plays very similar, but there are some excellent improvements; visually and in regards to the gameplay.\nAll the Assassin's Creed games had one major positive aspect: They look beautiful. You feel immersed and part of the environment and getting to a high point that allows you to overlook the entire city/area is truly a 'wow' moment. As far as the gameplay is concerned, I particularly like the fact that you can actually call a horse and ride it within the confines of the city, and the new weapons you can use; particularly the crossbow. Very cool, and foremost helpful if you're free-running and have to quick eliminate guards.\nLater on you get additional help once the brotherhood forms, but I won't say all too much here, because that is something that should be experienced!\nThe somewhat different economy system makes sense and works, as it provides you a fairly steady source of income right from the get go which definitely helps with upgrades and repairs. So far the missions are diversive, the envrionment feels lively and challenging and it's definitely a good addition to the series. Basically have, so far, never really felt bored.\nAs I said before, Rome certainly looks beautiful and in particular the recreation of the Colosseum is impressive. In general you have very recognizable landmarks. The entire area in which the game takes place is also huge, much bigger than you'd think when you get started. It grows very subtle, and suddenly you think, 'hold on, how did I get here?\" It is true that certain areas being \"unavailable\" in a certain memory sequence is a little annoying at times, but I guess, since AC is a very story and narrative based franchise, despite the free roaming, it makes sense to move the story along.\nThe world does evolve with you though. The only other game series that ever did this to a certain extend was GTA, but not with the same kind of subtlety and style Assassin's Creed does it; that is something that was there right from the start of th series, but it certainly evolved with each subsequent game.\nIf you liked the Assassin's Creed series up until this point, you will not be disappointed by \"Brotherhood\".", "hours": 42.9, "username": "jssrfx", "products": 402, "early_access": false}

Me, I stopped there after a while. Here's a few reasons why (it's basically the same reason all over, but it gets so annoying it's unbearable):\n1) You see a lookout on the map and try to reach it. However, you quickly realize that you can not access it just because you see it on the map. Because \"this memory is not available\".\n2) You want to return to a place you've been before, perhaps to get money from the bank or repair your armor? You'll notice that, other than in every other Assassin's Creed before, areas you've been to will not necessarily stay available. Suddenly these areas are \"not available\" anymore.\n3) I feel like I'm squeezed into a relatively narrow tunnel of \"available memory\", with only a bit of space opening before me, while it closes again behind me. Everytime I stray form the path a little, I can't continue because \"this area is not available\". Like the game is trying to get me through the missions and areas in a most linear way. Not the Assassin's Creed experience I came to know and love.\n4) I would like to repair a building to get a lookout point. I can reach the building. However, the building is controlled by a tower. I need to destroy the tower. However, the tower is in an area that is \"not available\". WTF?!?\nAt this point I was so\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665that I actually stopped playing, because I felt mucked.\nSeriously, it's a great game.

Ezio pulls together the 3 factions to defat a common enemy, and ends with a decent addition to the lore.  Graphics look good.  Combat is the same as usual.  Entertaining but frustrating.  Running through streets will enevitibly result in you running up a wall you didn't intend to, or hoping up on a barrel killing your progress in timed missions.  The camera will hide behind a tree during a battle with multiple enemies.  If Ubisoft could solve these issues this series would be a 9 or a 10 for me, but as of AC 4, they are still present.

Ubisoft got this game, the second one featuring Ezio Auditore as the protagonist, out in March 2011, three and a halve years ago. Having played it relatively soon after the original\n, I feel it natural to compare the two games to each other. This makes even more sense since the story of AC II really coninues in\n: not only do the same characters appear in both games, chronologically too they follow nicely upon each other.\nBrotherhood starts off splendidly, with a recapture of the final sequences of AC II which flows naturally into the new twists which the well-known story of the struggle between Assassins and Templars about world-changing artefacts takes. After the initial (short) part of the game that functions as a tutorial, I was taken straight into the city where almost all of the action takes place: Rome. The fact that there is only one major city here, compared to the two (Firenze and Venice) and the countryside of the original game, makes for a huge difference. Rome of around 1500 comes to live in\nin the most fantastic imaginable way. First of all, the map is HUGE: there are 12 districts (including the Vatican and some outer area's which have a rural sense about them), and running from one side of the city to the other would cost you at least ten-fifteen minutes (happily, horses are allowed in the city and there is a well-thought-off fast-travel system). Secondly, the development team has obviously taken the utmost care in analyzing how Rome anno 1500 looked like - and that's really quite different from modern-day Rome. During the first ten (!!) hours or so in-game, I mostly just walked around, discovering the city, marvelling at all the details in the buildings and eagerly reading the information provided for almost every single church, Roman building or other landmark. During my entire playthrough, I felt like being a tourist catapulted 500 years back to a place I love so much. That's quite some accomplishment, and I would even go so far as to call Rome the main character of the game, not Ezio.\nThat's not only because of the painstaking detail with which the \"Cit\u00e0 Eterna\" is being depicted, but it's also due to some problems with the concept of the game. Not only is the world almost entirely accessible from the start of the game, the number of side-missions is daunting, certainly compared to the main-story missions. Since I am a curious gamer, I tried some of these, than more of those missions, mixing it all up with the main storyline. Wrong! Almost every mission gives even more options afterwards, unlocking new factions or side-story lines, and they are of course all indicated on a over-cluttered map (which I had to zoom in really close to be able to read every sign on it). After a further ten hours or so into the game, I started feeling overwhelmed: there was SO much to do, to explore, to try, and it could all be done at my own initiative. Now this open-world concept may appeal to many gamers, but I like more of a narrative element, or at least a good backbone of a main story. And this exactly where\ntends to falter at times. Only by following the main story mission after mission (which I started doing after quite some time), did I refind the feeling of actually being Ezio Auditore, a feeling that had been so strong in AC II. Once I really plunged into it, the main storyline proved to be quite good, though not so compelling as the one in the previous game, and certainly much shorter (although this is more than made up for the number of side-missions and -excursions).\nIn all other departments than the identification with Ezio and the overdose of side-activities,\ndoes shine, just as I had hoped for. The walking/climbing/jumping and whatever more of Ezio is so fluent, that I actually felt becoming \"good\" at it, but as with the other AC games, using an Xbox 360 controller really is a must. Combat has been greatly improved upon alreay in AC II, and this game even adds more possibilities, all very natural. The biggest change is the addition of the Brotherhood: a group of Assassin's I could train by giving them missions abroad, and whose help I could call for when needed. Graphically, the game still is a gem, also after a couple of years. Only musically things could have been better: the music could have used a bit more variety.\nAll things put together,\nis a worthy successor to AC II, but it is flawed by trying to do too much, and all of that at once. It's not on the same steallr height as its predecessor, but it's still a very, very good game. Buy it if you tried and liked AC I and/or II, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first dive into the realm of the Assassins.\nGameplay: 24/30 (would have been higher with a tighter storyline)\nGraphics: 18/20\nSound: 7/10\nTechnical: 8/10 (I don't like Uplay as an extra \"shell\", but that's just how it is, and otherwise it's very stable)\nLongelivety: 9/10 (there is some MP which is mostly out of use, but SP alone gives you dozens of hours of gameplay)\nSteam-integration: 5/10 (as with almost all other Ubisoft titles: they try to promote Uplay...)\nPersonal appreciation: 9/10\nOverall: 80/100\n\nThis game contains one critical flaw and that is...the towns people don't like me much as whenever i am in a crowd i seem to steal everyones money...makes it really tough to sneak but i get plenty of cash!\n\nBest game of the series, although I have not played Blackflag yet.\n\nanother\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ass\u2642in game,what can you say,just one question don't you think that's weird that he speaking spanish?\n\nUplay crashes EVERYTIME so I cant play, thanks for taking anoth 5 dollars.

The customisation is more varied than AC2 aswell, but still sticking with some of the AC2 patterns, like Wetlands Ebony and some of the Florence colors.

Set between 1499-1509 Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring the 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and on his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family.\nIntersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to also prevent the 2012 apocalypse.\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood introduces rectruabile Assassins to the game. Ezio can now recruit new members to the Assassin Order by destroying any of the twelve \"Borgia towers\" around Rome where the papal troops are stationed, then by rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from the harassing guards.\nThere are new enemy archetypes in addition to those that were seen in AC II such as the horsemen, arquebusiers, the papal guards and others. Horses now also have a much larger role in AC Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport, but also as a component of different acrobatic sequences and also so much more advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them.\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood is also the first game in the whole Assassin's Creed Franchise to feature multiplayer which consists of three game modes, Free for All, Co-Op and Team. This game is just full of amazing detail in every aspect; The story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and much more.\nI really recommend this for the mere fact that it's just always fun to play, and there is just so much things that you can do in the game.

There are new gadgets (crossbow, poison darts, parachute to name a few) that make Ezio's arsenal finally feel complete (I'm not sure why it took so long to get the crossbow though, Altair had one in the intro movie for the first game). The ability to call assassin's is great fun and actually makes you feel like part of the brotherhood instead of just a lone wolf. In many ways Ezio is just completely overpowered (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so when I see a group of guards it's a question of how do I want to kill them as opposed to what is the most effective way to kill them since all the methods are effective. The Leonardo missions are also fun (Ezio gets to drive a tank in one).\nThat said, this game feels like it really should have been an expansion pack for AC2 instead of a sequel. There isn't much to the story and what is there is drawn out longer than it should have been. Ideally the best placement for this game would have been right before the final act of AC2 so Ezio builds up to finally confronting his arch rival.

With the sequel, Ubisoft managed to monumentally improve virtually every aspect of the series, giving us a tightly wound narrative, a charismatic lead, and refined mechanics that came together for one of the best games of the last few years.\nFollowing up this achievement is Brotherhood, arriving barely a year after the first and on the surface seeming little more than a retread of what we already saw, and an easy cash grab before a full fledged sequel can be made. In some ways this is accurate, as Brotherhood in many ways is incredibly similar to its predecessors, but to call it anything less than an entire new experience would be a disservice, as for how short a time it had in the oven it's just as large and engrossing as the games that came before it, while also adding an assortment of excellent new mechanics that push the game forward even when it occasionally stumbles in the wake of critical acclaim.\nBeing a direct sequel, Brotherhood picks up mere moments after the end of II, with the surprising (arguably convoluted) events that transpired still fresh in Ezio's mind though it would appear he has finally arrived at a moment of peace after all his struggles. Of course nothing good ever lasts long, and it doesn't take long for his enemies to catch up with him, kill yet more of what little family he has left, and send Italy tumbling into chaos, leaving you to pick up the pieces (though for once you aren't alone).\nAfter the fantastic birth to assassin story of II, Brotherhood's more traditional tail of revenge mixed with some incomprehensible supernatural elements never quite manages to achieve the same level of intrigue and pacing. Though perfectly solid and enough to drive the experience, aside from the first and last few hours it meanders through much of its plot, spiraling off into dozens of disconnected tangents that feel more like side missions than an overarching narrative which left me feeling rather disengaged with everything that was happening. By the end I had lost the investment I previously had in these characters, and simply wanted it all to wrap up in a way that somehow made it all pull together, which again it unfortunately failed to. This isn't to say that Brotherhood isn't entertaining, or that the story is terrible, but it lacked the sense of urgency and tightness that exuded from every moment of II and came off a tad rushed.\nThankfully, Brotherhood plays incredibly well, taking everything that worked with II and adding in enough fresh elements and interesting mission types to be just as engaging. The most readily apparent change is that of the scenery, moving away from Venice and into the sprawling city of Rome. It's a far larger environment, that feels more alive than ever thanks in part to the expanded town building system which now encompasses the whole of the city, allowing you to renovate shops and tunnels to provide income, more areas to purchase items, and fast travel across the map. It also makes it easier to feel invested in the city as you see it build up around you with each new renovation. It's a huge world to explore, yet every inch of it is packed with an enormous amount of things to do, leaving little idle space and a never ending stream of missions the vast majority of which are surprisingly fleshed out and enjoyable.\nAs the name implies, Brotherhood no longer sees you fighting alone but instead building up an army of assassins which you can then send on contracts and call in when you need aid. It's a tad underdeveloped in its current state, but it nonetheless greatly changes how you can approach an encounter, as often times calling in assassins which can pop out of anywhere is far less risky than attempting to get close to a target yourself. They also work as convenient distractions, and add a layer to encounters that feels especially needed when the combat is still trapped in a fairly dull design that despite numerous cool kill animations never became very fun and was best avoided whenever possible.\nOther minor tweaks in takedowns, platforming, and general movement add some noticeable refinement to the series core gameplay, though there are still moments when the camera will freak out or the free running system will send you jumping randomly completely in the wrong direction. Animations in particular continue to stick out to me as incredibly well done, with Ezio in particular moving with as much grace and fluidity as you'd expect from an assassin. Lastly Jasper Kyd's original score is utterly gorgeous and sets the mode strikingly well at every moment, as if his music is deeply tied into the world and speaking to you as you traverse it.\nDespite its narrative shortcomings, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is by no means the sloppily churned out annualized rubbish it very well could be, instead a brilliant successor to what I would consider an utter masterpiece, and a remarkably well crafted game on its own measures. If you've yet to touch the series this certainly isn't the place to jump in, but if you were left wanting more after II, Brotherhood will certainly satisfy and then some.", "hours": 19.0, "username": "MrNinjaSquirrel", "products": 1732, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Or, for long distances traveling - if one doesn't want to use sewers system the horse is only choice. But not in tight streeets of Rome, you can get really hard times with your horse stucked somewhere on the corner etc ;)).\n- there is no more killing from back of your horse with your sword possibility. You just can't draw your sword while being on horse. Which looks strage, but to be honest - it gave too much overpower to Ezio. Ezio was almost immortal with sword being on horse back. It was fun for a while, but with that were some parts of game too much easy. Specially liberating Borgia towers was like \"one finger in my nose, second hand on my mouse\", i just took a horse, draw my sword and even hardes Borgia towers were cleaned of Borgia soldier within minute with no need to use of medicine.\nCons:\n- as i play third AC in row (started with ACII, then AC:B, now i play AC:Reveletaions) i start thinking there should be difficulty setting, i fell very often like as guards are totally blinded or def\n- parachutes from Leonardo! Worst thing ever, for what is it if you can't use it as primary tool for escaping some fight/battle which gone wrong? I was unable to use parachute almost everytime i was \"known, seeked and chased\". In time of peace i had no problem to deploy parachute.\nConclusion:\nWho loved AC and loved ACII will enjoy AC:B. And i have no problem with strictly continuity of Ezio story (so one needs to know ACII before playing AC:B and needs to know AC:B before playing AR:Revelations).", "hours": 57.0, "user_id": "76561198076587335", "username": "bujablaster", "products": 167, "early_access": false}

I'm not even sure if I can put my finger on why that is either.  Perhaps less flag/feather gathering.  I'm a bit of a completionist so that drove me insane in AC2.  Though admittedly I didn't gather everything in this entry either.  For those without AC experience, there are flags and other items to \"collect\" scattered around the game.  Some are in hard to reach places or locked areas that open up as you progress.  For the most part I enjoyed the \"jumping puzzle\" and added challenge of figuring out how to get to them.  Some may not...for some reason in AC2 I was at my wit's end due to the size of the game and high number/variety of items. The feeling of \"missing something\" was constantly there and it became tedious trying to figure out what I may have overlooked.\nOne of the bigger changes in Brotherhood in regard to missions, was that every single one had an added challenge in order for you to get 100% synchronization for a memory.  At first, I found this extremely frustrating especially since I hadn't mastered some of the combat mechanics (like kill streaks, though once I figured that out it, my game changed dramatically).  But eventually I ended up finding that the missions were a lot more fun with the added challenge.  Granted, there were times I was cursing how clumsy I was with the controls. This did eliminate some freedom in how you decided to complete a mission.  That was my biggest lament over this feature...but for me, it wasn't a terrible thing.\nThe acrobatics in this installment are as you'd expect them.  Perhaps it was my imagination, but it felt more responsive than the previous games and  traversing the rooftops felt more fluid than ever.  As much as I'd expect to get tired of it, just jumping from rooftop to rooftop, is a good time.\nIt's no wonder flabby gamers everywhere love the AC series because it lets you become the ultimate acrobatic badass as you hang from a ledge by one hand flashing your 12 pack abs to the ladies below. Those courtesans may sleep with everyone else in the game, but let's face it, they all want you (Ezio).\nI have to give props to the music in the game.  The perfect track always started when you were jumping through ruins, fighting 20 guards or racing the clock.  It always felt right.\nI liked the storyline this time around.  I had to recap what happened in AC2 before I played Brotherhood. But I'll be starting Revelations knowing exactly what happened in Brotherhood. No shortage of intrigue and I have to give the writers credit, I love the whole premise of visiting a time period hundreds of years ago while progressing a sci fi story in the present/future. It's brilliant from a sequel standpoint, especially considering the fact that I'm 3 games behind the current release (with a new one on the way).\nI hope Revelations is as satisfying as Brotherhood. I know AC2 was a fan favorite, after reading reviews and comments about it.  I can understand why some loved AC2 over AC1 due to AC1's repetitiveness but I didn't get much out of the crazy amount of side quests and collecting in AC2.  I also felt like AC1 was stronger from a storytelling perspective (with the ending being an exception perhaps). Ezio was very difficult to like at first too. Perhaps that's why Brotherhood won me over.  It took all of AC2 and Brotherhood for me to warm up to him.", "hours": 55.7, "username": "Reece", "products": 427, "early_access": false}

It's expansive, has a TON of collectibles of all kinds, a massive map that's genuinely interesting and fun to explore, not to mention a handful of additional areas outside of Rome. Rome is a spawling, living, breathing city that really comes to life with purpose and function, both helping and hindering you depending on how careful you are. The social stealth is still in strong and the extent to which you can customize your appearance is also nice.\nThe new features in the climbing and combat are welcome, making things more fluid and tactical. I liked the 'boss battles' that don't repeat themselves or rely on simply being strong enough, instead weave story into their encounters. The story, by the way, is fantastic. The voices, both in english and Italian are also amazing. Characters are great, lovable, amusing, visuals hold up well... etc. The pluses go on.\nThat being said... I did have a few small critiques. Not that they affect my rating, but you may have trouble associating which way is \"forward\" during some fixed-camera sequences, as well as some inconsistent behaviour by the AI and engine in general, such as guards detecting you immediately when they normally don't, or even glitching to appear out of thin air. It wasn't often enough to ruin my experience, but it's not a perfect game because of these, and the sometimes frustrating requirements for 100% completion.\nAll in all, a fantastic title and well worth playing AC2 for, I look forward to playing Revelations greatly.

You continue following Desmond and he continues reliving Ezio's life. The game made a few improvements over 2, although not as big of a jump as it was from 1. The entire story takes place in Roma and only a few of the mechanics are changed. There are a few new weapons, a few new moves, a few new ways to get around buildings, and a few new vehicles. Before you can use shops, you're going to have to rennovate them yourself which cost money but increases the value of the city. I found the economy to be much more steady in this game than the previous game.\nOne of the most satisfying parts of this game was destroying the Borgia's towers. In every area, before you can rennovate shops and buy buildings, you have to eliminate the Borgia's influence. To do this, you need to assassinate a leader near their tower and then set the tower on fire. What makes this so satisfying is because this is completely open. You don't have to \"start\" the side quest like you have to with others. You can just go there, sneak in, and kill the leader however you want. If you are discovered, some leaders will come fight you while others will hide in the tower (forcing you to wait until the next dusk/dawn for them to return).\nAlso, about halfway through the game (maybe a little earlier) you can begin recruiting people to the brotherhood. When you rescue a citizen, they start training to become assassins. You can send them on missions to increase their level and upgrade their weapons and armor or you can use them to fight for you. Sometimes it's not worth getting your hands dirty so just lock onto your target, hit the appropriate key and your recruits will jump out of the shadows and assassinate for you. If you have enough recruits, you can also arrow storm which will eliminate a group of guards.\nThe only thing I didn't like about this game was Uplay. It's not so much that I don't like signing up for Uplay or that I feel annoyed my game is forever attached to my Uplay account (after all, that's basically the same as Steam). But what frustrated me was that Uplay would open every time I exited the game.

If you can be ok with a ton of repitition, other wise avoid or take caution.\nBrotherhood is probably one of the more boring games i've played, which is dissapointing considering I thought Assassin's Creed 2 was quite good. All the story missions are the same thing over and over game, kill that thing, go here, don't get caught, and of course FOLLOW MISSIONS, which are one of the worst mission types for any sandbox game ever considering the stealth in this game is shoddy.\nIn comparison to Assassin's Creed 2 it is staggering how much quality has been lost.\nOptimization: Assassin's Creed 2 was nicely optomized for pc, it ran well and I don't recall many issues. For ACB the game is laggy, it looks kinda bleh at times, and the video settings keep going to their defaults every single time you re-enter the game, and I found no way to fix this.\nGameplay: Already covered above; story mission too repetitive, and not really varied. Nothing memorable here.\nSetting: Rome is dull. The landscape is bland and honestly uninteresting. We wen't from the streets of Venice to the open grass lands of...Well Rome. I don't know if it might suit someone else's tastes, but I find it uninteresting.\nThis is honestly a pretty weak game in my opinion, not bad persay, but following Assassin's Creed 2 it just doesn't hold up as well, considering its more of the same plus it being incredibly boring and repetative at times.

I love the ability to call assassins at any time during the game. There's only one city to explore, but Rome is absolutely big and varied, and full of things to do. It's a great and geographically varied setting, ranging from rural areas to densely populated city areas. There's also some additional levels outside the city (Leonardo's war machines missions) and some nice surprises along the way. The secret locations from AC2 also make a return as fantastically designed Lairs of Romulus - these are some great platforming levels and completing them is a real pleasure.\nBrotherhood has a great cast of characters and the overall story is interesting. My only gripe is lack of character development for side characters later in the game - Claudia, Maria and Leonardo all suffer from this, leaving their stories a bit incomplete. What's great about Brotherhood is also the modern day bit of the story. It's fantastic - and you actually get to do things as Desmond.\nThis Assassin's Creed outing has also introduced multiplayer for the first time in the series.

Gameplay speaking, this Assassin's Creed \"2.5\" adds more mechanics for playability, you can recruit assassins to join the Assassins' cause.\nBrotherhood continues the trilogy story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and now focus solely on Rome. The city is big, really big to explore. Although, even if it is quite big, I much preferred the different locations in AC2 than \"only being in Rome\". There is a tons of collectibles in this game... too many for my taste. 101 Borgia Flags does unlock you the Borgia Cape, which sets the notoriety permanently at none. Same effects occurs if you completely rebuild Rome with renovations, you unlock the Auditore Cape. I had the Auditore Cape on my PlayStation 3 playthrough and it was satisfactory to go on a rampage without being chased by guards all the time. But you're more than likely to unlock that cape quite late in the game which makes it almost pointless.\nPROS:\n+Strong narrative, both in the present with Desmond Miles and in the Animus, Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\n+Graphically improved compared to AC2 albeit contains visual glitches at times.\n+Soundtrack is excellent and again, composed by Jesper Kyd.\n+Same as AC2, the voice acting is solid.\n+Improved combat system.\n+More weapons and you can now carry heavy weapons.\n+Recruiting and using assassins on targets.\n+Multiplayer ain't my fort\u00e9 in the AC franchise, but it is very original nonetheless.\n+Ability to replay missions.\n+High replay value.\nCONS:\n-Uplay DRM.\n-Horrendous WASD keyboard + mouse scheme. Play this game with a gamepad! (I played Brotherhood with the Xbox One controller and it worked without any issues).\n-AC: Brotherhood feels like a big filler and not a proper sequel or expansion.\n-Silly timer on pretty much every assassination missions. Very irritating!\n-Some stupid requirements during missions like to not be seen or it causes desynchronisation.\n-Draw distance in this game seems broken at times, especially when you see guards appearing right in front of you, i.e.\n-Rome pretty much looks like the same anywhere you go in Italy.\n-Steep learning curve for the Multiplayer mode.\n-The cliffhanger ending is very irritating.\n-Too many collectibles... however, once seen in Eagle Vision, it sticks on your map for later acquisition.\n-Annoying \"Full synchronisation\" on missions / side-missions that don't do anything except unlock Trophies (PS3) or Achievements.\nOVERALL:\nBrotherhood ain't perfect for sure. But if you loved previous AC games, you'll enjoy this game very much. If you're a newcomer in the AC franchise, you could love this game a lot as well but you're gonna feel lost in the story. My best advice, you better play the previous games or at least, get informed by reading / watching wikia and videos online or you're gonna feel completely off the track!\nThis game adds a few great mechanics which is always welcomed. Although, I felt this game to be more of a filler than a sequel / expansion. It is a good filler that is well paced... right until the very end scene which leaves you in a cliffhanger!\nRECOMMENDATION:\nYes, I highly recommend this game for anyone loving this playstyle. The story is very interesting and you feel quite engaged with it as much as the past and the future events. My favorite AC game so far is still AC2 but Brotherhood continues on the same premise so you won't feel lost when playing it.\nRATING:\n8.0 / 10\nAnd now, going to revisit AC: Revelations...", "hours": 26.3, "username": "LIKEUCARE", "products": 1534, "early_access": false}

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third installment to the series leaving off where Assassin's Creed 2 left off. The game feels very much like the second in many ways but the most notable is that the main character is still the assassin named Ezio, honestly most of the time I think of this more as an expansion pack instead of a standalone. Even with that being said many new features were brought into the game, most of these changes are still in the most recent release Black Flag.\nThe game takes the gameplay of the second and enhances upon it, for example now you can equip the hidden gun with the sword or the dagger with throwing knives. Combat is far less time consuming with the introduction of the kill streaks, although this is useful it takes much of the difficulty out of the game. This is also the game that introduces assassin recruits, although it feels less refined than revalations they are still a very welcome addition to the game. Also the game adds some replayablity by allowing you to revisit missions unlike the second game, it even goes as far as to give you a reason to go back with extra objectives in a mission to accomplish what is known as \"full sync\". Full synchronization is nice for those who are completionists and want more out of the game but sometimes they get frustrating. Last but not least the controls are still a little touchy at times you may jump the completely wrong way, this can get very annoying especially when you jump off cliffs.\nSorry about the rambling there, honestly this may not be mechanically my favorite of the series but it is still one of my favorites from the series. The game introduces many mechanics that would later be some of my favorite aspects to the series after they were refined. This game definitely has my approval for anyone thinking of purchasing.", "hours": 51.3, "username": "johnbenston", "products": 194, "early_access": false}

Ezio needs to liberate each sector in the city of Roma by destroying the Borgia towers. Doing so will free the sector and let Ezio rebuild the sector, such as reopening blacksmith shops, doctor shops or banks, gaining income in the process. The game also let Ezio to recruit Assassins by helping troubled civilians who can then help him to fight guards or kill his mission target.

Part of this weirdness feeling is good: Ezio \u201cfeels\u201d older \u2013 he should be. The patchy beard, the slight comments from NPC\u2019s here and there, the louder noise he makes when he drops from a height, it all adds to the feeling that the character you have played with since his teenage days in Firenze is now close to or in his  40\u2019s \u2013 but don\u2019t worry; he can still do all the good stuff. This, ageing, is not an easy thing to convey in a game and many developers will not do it at all, keeping their character closer to a young aged audience, but for a story like AC it is both needed and, in this case, well executed.\nThe other part of the weirdness is perhaps not so good. AC Brotherhood needs time. In the beginning you feel a bit thrown into the game world without much to go on, no real idea where to begin. Perhaps that is a good thing. Ultimately, the small pieces of your \u201cwork\u201d here and there begin to consolidate the picture and you start to tread on more solid ground. One point of complaint is the map and menu navigation which Ubisoft for some reason messed with from the previous game, with not so good results.\nUltimately, Brotherhood continues the story from ACII nicely, deepens the plot, creates more questions but is all in all enjoyable. The recruitment of assassins adds a nice touch to the feeling that you are part of something larger and eventually \u2013 at its head.", "hours": 77.5, "user_id": "76561198057575998", "username": "Pandelis", "products": 37, "early_access": false}

Many times the camera will change and make you miss a jump or something else. Made me rage quit sometimes. Really annoying.\nIn the end, it is a good game.

Also probably gonna ignore multiplayer for this game and all other AC's so forgive me.\nWARNING:Contains Spoilers\nSTORY:Again you assume the role of Desmond Miles as he,Lucy,Rebecca,and Shaun head to Ezio's villa to escape Abstergo. You find the room where Ezio had attained Altair's armour and set up shop here but not without doing a little mission. After that you assume Ezio once again going into his final memorie where he fought the main antagonist of the game Cesare Borgia but Desmond is locked out of the memory. Just like AC1 he must go through the earlier memories before he can go back to the final one. This story honestly is one of the best, second to AC2 and better than Revelations it's gone it's own deaths, accomplishes, twists and turns. Again it wasn't as good as AC2's story but at least it was better than Revelation's story.\n7.9/10\nGRAPHICS: The graphics here are better than AC2, cleaner textures, better frames, ect. It's great for it's age (2010) and still in my opinion hasn't dated yet.9/10\nGAMEPLAY:Oh boy here we go where do I even start.......the gameplay was okay? If I just spill it out this game made me ragequit it multiple times, not for the main missions but for the side missions. The tank mission was horrible, one hit and you were done you couldn't get hit once or your full sync would fail. The young at heart sucked too, and those side missions where you only had 6 minutes to complete the mission or no full sync. Also to clarify, full sync is supposed to represent how Ezio did completed his missions and side missions but honestely Ubisoft shouldn't have integrated this yet because there was extreme difficulty issues in some missions. Yeah it would be a breeze for normal fans, but full sync fans would learn that the levels did not suit for full sync, they had to find that out the hard way and it was a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Sorry for the rant but the other gameplay elements are at least better than this, with you calling out Assassin's and taking out your enemies like a boss you truly feel like a grandmaster assassin also mentioning finding items to get armor, fast poison ect was stupid on Ubisoft's part too.6.5/10\nCONCLUSION: AC:B was honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There was too difficult side missions, finding ridiculus items to get other items, and full sync. But it balances this by putting in a good story, calling assassins and new gear and weapons but I still can't forgive it's frustratingness and hopefully I won't play this game again.\nBUY RANK:1-2 (Putting this in because the game is like 20 bucks)", "hours": 37.9, "user_id": "76561198028032411", "username": "Claylex", "products": 248, "early_access": false}

Sometimes there are weird camera angles, making it hard for trick jumps where they are required and controls get a bit mixed up with the camera angle as it is. Dying clothes and capes requires money, which wasn't required in the previous game. You can now have execution streaks which are always dead useful when you're surrounded, counters are now 100% guaranteed to work everytime. Some of the viewpoints are at the top of the Borgia Towers (makes sense) but Borgia Towers that are lv5 will have Captains that will run, which was a pain to catch. Lastly, the Armor of Brutus (the best armor in the game) just doesn't look very nice to me, Altair's Armor had been swag, but Armor of Brutus....eh.

Unfotunately one mission couldn't be solved (the flying mission) because the controlls stopped working. After that my motivation to take on other missions or try multiplayer was gone and I tried to end the game as fast as possible.\nSome of the bugs are well known to Ubisoft, but they never provided patches as I've learned on some message boards.\nUPlay worked on my playthrough (others weren't as lucky), but I still don't understand the need for a double DRM. Being forced to make an account for playing offline really got on my nerves.\nThis game was also very prone to crashes and Alt-Tabbing out of it was completely out of the question.\nWhereas in AC 2 you visit different cities, in this game you just remain in Rome. This and the repetitive missions killed most of the replay value.\nAll in all I'd give this game 3 out of 10 points mainly for the story and the whole climbing and stealth mechanics - if that's also what you love about the AC series I'd reccomend you to buy AC 1 and leave it at that.\nThis game was a total waste of money.

Buy it now! // 31st of December 13\nI have decided to re-make this review since, originally, I just wrote it because I saw a negative review of this game. So here goes!\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place just where the second game ends, making it a direct sequel. In this game you still relive the memories of your ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. In the real world however, things change a bit. Desmond and the crew have moved the entire operation to Monteriggioni, the town that Ezio's family had earlier lived in. This means that you can, at any given time, exit out of the Animus and wander around in the real world. This is a nice edition, but is sadly not that well made as there are little to none things to do.\nThe gameplay of this installment has been improved from the previous games. The fighting is well made and you will feel a sense of progression as enemies will be easier to defeat as your skill goes up. Also combos have been introduced, making fighting 2+ enemies will not feel as rubish anymore.\nBut fighting is only have the game, of cource the climbing has been improved. This is not as noticable though, as it was good in the older games aswell.\nThis game features alot of quests, aside from the main storyline, that are well fitted into the story and helps you get a better understanding on how Ezio was as a person. The most well made once were the once featuring no one else that your friend, Leonardo da Vinci. He is back with long, well made mission for you to complete. But not only that, he also sells you items that will spice up the gameplay, giving you tons of new options on how to do thing.\nGeneraly speaking this game is a masterpiece in the Assassin's Creed series. The story is great, you will come to care about the characters, the gameplay mechanics are improved, still same stunning visuals as the last game. Basically a worthy sequel that was not made to cash in on the Assassin's Creed name.", "hours": 45.3, "username": "\ua9c1\ua9c2", "products": 143, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "48190", "page": 208, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-12-17", "text": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues right where Assassin's Creed II finished, so if you haven't played Assassin's Creed II I'd highly recommend playing that game first. Not only was it a good game, but it's almost essential at this point to play it so you can understand the story. This may not seem important, but for me the story is the most intriguing element to the entire franchise.\nThe gameplay continues to improve game-on-game, but it's pretty much the same mechanic we've seen since the first Assassin's Creed game. Sure they've removed the terribly rigid design to the missions where you MUST scale this tower before you can do anything else, and I'm personally grateful they did this. However, overall the gameplay isn't that amazing. It's fun, sure, but at the same time it's played it's course now. Don't get me wrong, you can still scale the towers to remove the fog of war, but now it's optional.\nIn fact it works well within what is slowly becoming a very sandbox style world, and this is another area of the game I'm starting to enjoy with each Assassin's Creed game. Ubisoft seem to be aware of what people enjoyed from Assassin's Creed II and disliked from Assassin's Creed and have done a good job of doing more of the same, and removing the offending elements of gameplay.\nGone are the insane amount of collectibles, and instead we have more Tombs/Lairs to explore, Glyphs to discover and solve and an entire city to manage. While these elements aren't essential to complete the game, and at times they don't seem to to do much to the story at all (and I personally found the city management side of the game to be over before it begun), it's nice to see that there are options there for people who wish to slow things down and invest into the Assassin's Creed world.\nIt's not all roses though, there are a few elements to Brotherhood that confused me. I'm hooked into the story, I want to know more, I want it to expand and progress, and sadly Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood never truly felt like it got going. It felt that it was one long prelude into Assassin's Creed: Revelations, with most of the Memory Segments feeling more like tutorials for the new gameplay mechanics or refreshing into franchise staple gameplay mechanics (most of which any Assassin's Creed fan would hopefully already be aware of). It's a minor fault, and if anything it's something of a Ubisoft Trademark to have excessive gameplay hints/tips/tutorials throughout the game.\nIt doesn't really distract from the game, but it does slow down the buzz and adrenaline that has built up after the huge climax to Assassin's Creed II. Now that I've finished the game, I'm not too concerned about the lull as I can fool myself enough to believe it was perhaps intentional pacing to bring you backdown to build you back up for Brotherhood's ending (which was decent).\nYet, I'm still left feeling 'what really happened' during Ezio's memory segments. I know who the main target was within the story, but you have so little interaction with them directly that you don't really focus on them (unlike in Assassin's Creed II where The Spaniard is referenced and featured in most segments).\nSadly there is one element to the game that is lagging behind Assassin's Creed II and that's the soundtrack. I was convinced it was a new composer as it just felt alien compared to the previous work of Jasper Kydd. I just couldn't connect to it.\nAlso, once again the character modles have changed ever so slightly but strangely noticably. A minor point of annoyance.\nOverall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a fun game, and somewhat fast paced (almost to the point where it feels like it's over before it even begun). If you're hooked into the series by this point I'd recommend buying Brotherhood as it continues the story in an easy fun game. If you didn't really enjoy Assassin's Creed II, I think it's best you bow out of the series now and leave Brotherhood, as it's more of the same.\nThe characters are slowly developing, and the plot is thickening. I also know that some people don't enjoy the 'future tech' side of the game, namely the areas outside of Ezio (such as being Desmond and the whole Animus side of world). I personally enjoy the mix of history and Sci-Fi within the game, so I don't find this to be a problem; however for those who do find it a problem there is a somewhat large/significant portion of Brotherhood that centres around the 'adventures of Desmond', so again it might be best to avoid Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.", "hours": 20.7, "username": "Chris", "products": 1901, "early_access": false}

Everything's cool yeah? No conflict? Ezio can move on with his life? THINK AGAIN. A raid on the Auditore Villa from an incest spoiled backstabbing murdering brat of a bad guy and the death of his Uncle Mario leads Ezio and the assassins to Rome. The place he just came back from. With everything lost, Ezio must build the assassins up like no one else, save Masyaf, has done in years.\nThis game was hard to tell if it is worthy to get and play. On the one hand, the new multiplayer mode is very weak. I'd like to meet the person who thought a stealth action single player needed a team deathmatch multiplayer... and thought it was a good idea because they kept doing it. The story was nice, the bad guy was compelling in the sense he would not stop \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing and I wanted to stab him in the neck. That was the point, right? AC:II left a major question as to what's worse then templars and doesn't seem to stop with that. Finally, Desmond suffers a mild break down after being controlled by the apple to kill off one of the crew. WHO WILL IT BE? It seems to be ubisoft hell bent goal to ground the AC series as a present day action and certianly not the lives of Ezio's Ancestors. Because starting out a game where it's in the past and you know history as a little bit differently is very restricting in the drama department. I mean, it's not like you can nuke greece and say \"Well, it wasn't in the history books, but our games should get great ratings now.\"\nThe bad taste to this game is Multiplayer and Optional objectives. In order for 100% sync, you no long have to collected treasure, feathers, and flags. Oh wait, no, you do. But you also have to finish each memory, except for a few, with optional objectives. \"Ezio's a bad\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and took no damage in this fight. You should too\" was probably the most annoying one. Actually, no, the \"Finish this wolf pack temple in 8 minutes or less\" was probably more annoying. Even if you knew the layout, it was rare that this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665was possible. It doesn't stop you from finishing the game but does not make it fun to know the game is saying \"Your way is nice but you could have done better.\"\nMuiltiplayer. Seriously, who looks at stealth action and says \"This needs more people playing together! Let't make everyone feel like ninjas.\" It gets worse as the series continues, as they've added Multiplayer actions in rewards to Ubisoft's Uplay DRM- I mean Steam Client- I mean \"Play and Win\" system that certianly has not been added to a majority of new games for the securROM feature that you can use to buy games, rewards, and snacks from. This game has no uplay action and everything can be completed within single player itself, but Revalation, III, and Black Flag does and I'm going to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 uncontrollable about that when the time comes to review them. In the mean time...\nWould I recommend getting this game? AC:II tied it off nice and neat. If you've got to find a reason to kill more things with your hidden blade, O.P. hidden gun, or poison dart, I suppose you can get this game. Just don't say no one warned you about the multiplayer.\nP.S. Oh, I almost forgot. Pre-rendered trailer at the start of the first assassin's creed?

Ezio has most of his weapons from the beginning with a few slight tweaks including stronger poison, parachute, poison darts (which are a lot of fun to shoot at the enemies by the way), a crossbow and a heavy sheath that allows you to carry larger weapons instead of having to pick them up and drop them. The game is still a free running action adventure sandbox game, but there is no more emphasis on the guilds and a new mechanic in which allows Ezio to train new assassins that he can call and use whenever, with a limit of course.\nWhen you destroy the Borgia towers, I will explain the Borgia later, you can train one assassin per tower for a total of 13 assassins. The player can then send these assassins on missions in order to level them up to what this game calls master assassins. A nice aspect of this is that when there are a lot of enemies you can call in some assassin\u2019s and they easily can take care of the them, take note, it was a whole lot of fun calling in all 7 that I could at a time.\nOne more change between these two iterations is the combo and fighting system. In Brotherhood you can now dual wield allowing a lot more options during a fight. They have added a whole bunch of new finishing moves and combos to your combat repertoire. There is a lot less bugs in this game as well though I was playing it long after the release so they could have easily patched it by now.\n\nThe story continues where AC2 left off. Ezio returns home and decides that his days as an assassin are done and wonders if he should have killed  Pope Rodrigo Borgia. Shortly after, Monteriggioni is attacked by Cesare(pronounced Ches \u2013 er \u2013 \u00e1) Borgia (Son of the Pope) and Mario Auditore is killed in the process. Ezio decides to return to Rome and rebuild the Assassin\u2019s Guild/Brotherhood (hey look the name of the game) and take down the Borgia threat. Eventually after about 4 years of destroying Borgia strongholds, resources, and the like, he takes them out of power and discovers the location of the Apple of Eden that was taken from Leonardo da Vinci.\nThe whole reason for Desmund to follow this time period of Ezio\u2019s life is in order to find the location of the Apple of Eden themselves and the Grand Temple. The characters in this game are a lot stronger than in the AC2; in fact the Pope\u2019s kids even have an incestuous relationship that drives Cesare in trying to conquer all of Italy. These characters were all based on actual historic people which makes the story even more compelling.\n\nI didn\u2019t talk much about controls in the last review so I figured I should make a mention of how this game is played on PC. A lot of the controls rely on a mix of  4 or 5 different keys. While in combat and locked onto an enemy, if you hold the right mouse button down you will parry an attack. However right after you parry, if you click the left mouse button you proceed to do a counter attack which (unless the enemy is especially good at defending against) will do a finishing move that will kill that enemy.\nIf immediately after your finishing move you click the left mouse button again and a direction, you can do another finishing move that will continue until you either miss or run out of enemies you can perform the move on, this is called a chain attack.  Also, using \u2018Q\u2019  allows you to change your weapons and pressing spacebar while holding the right mouse button will kick your enemies. When you are in free run mode, right mouse does a sort of fast run and holding space allows you to scale walls and move faster up said walls. The shift key allows you to drop while climbing and if you are falling, it also allows you to catch a ledge and stop. These are most of the standard controls apart from \u2018wasd\u2019 to move around and mouse to look around.\n\nAs for the graphics they are still very nice, even for a 2-3 year old game and are a slight improvement over the second game. On top of that, the architecture of the buildings and the design of Rome was very well done and close to that of what Rome might have been like in the early 16th century. The sound and voice acting is still top notch and is over looked in a game like this where the voice actors have to try and use strong accents and mix the languages between English, Old Italian and French.\nOverall this is a much improved game, however it felt to me like the story just didn\u2019t stick with me as well as AC2 or Revelations (which was my favorite out of the trilogy).\n\u2022\tStory  - 4 out of 5\n\u2022\tGameplay \u2013 4 out of 5\n\u2022\tGraphics \u2013 5 out of 5\n\u2022\tSound  - 5 out of 5\n\u2022\tFun \u2013 5 out of 5\nOverall a total score of 4.6 out of 5", "hours": 51.9, "username": "Freelancer", "products": 1493, "early_access": false}

Any normal player would think that makes sense so we can preserve the tank, keep it undamaged to use later.  HA!  FOOLED YOU!  This is bad game design, no lets make the mission ungodly difficult, then after you beat the mission, lets have th player jump out of the tank and blow it up!\n*Bonus bad design:  Make it a looOOoooong mission, where if you get damaged in the tank, instead of going back to a checkpoint, you need to restart the entire mission.\nNext chapter in Bad Game Design:  Build open world, imagine a big world you can explore, gamers would like that!  That isnt how its done in this game, thanks to more bad game design there are stupid white walls everywhere that just kill you if you touch them.  There is no excuse for this, I found it altered none of the story if you could just go to different places.  How that would ruin any game is just beyond me.\nMultiple endings:  Games that offer different ways of achieving a goal through creative thoughtful strategy is often rewarded.  Not in AC brotherhood, most missions if someone looks at you, you just die and have to restart.  Suddenly everyone of the bad guys in Italy are medusas, and if they look at you apparently you die.\nPlaying this I often picture the developers, who are in their corporate headquarters on a hill as the sky grows dark lightning crashes around it.  They sit in a meeting room making lists of how to make the game worse.

A beautiful city filled with the good things in life: wine, women, neck-stabbings... Following up on the much acclaimed Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood's single player campaign tells the story of an older Ezio Auditore, a master assassin who's home is attacked by the powerful Borgia family, forcing him to relocate to Rome in pursuit of people to pay loving steel retribution to. While you're on your revenge tour, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers you the opportunity to train your own army of assassins, raising them from street urchins to your own private army of conspicuously dressed murderers.\nWhile many aspects of the game, such as the free-running system central to the game's mechanics or the counterattack-based combat, have received slight refinement if any real changes at all, the package as a whole feels well-put together. That's not to say no changes have been made, as there are portions of the game which have received noticeable improvements, primarily the visuals. Assassin's Creed II, while a detailed protrayal of Renaissance Italy, suffered from a color palette that at times could be described as downright dreary and washed out. With the move to Rome, AC:B has given Ezio a much brighter environment to commit murder in. Colors are more vibrant, the sun actually shines, and the setting benefits greatly from it. Running around in Rome became a pleasure, not an occasional chore. Characters and character animations have also been improved, and it doesn't always feel as if Ezio spends his time talking with snappily dressed mannequins.\nPerhaps the best and most noticeable improvement to the Assassin's Creed formula, however, stems from the new multiplayer mode. Pitting players against each other in a battle of cunning and stabbings in a variety of game modes, AC: B's multiplayer offering you the chance to test your assassin skills against live opponents tests you in a way few other multiplayer games do. While there are several game types to choose from, the highlight for many players will be the Wanted mode. It helps that this mode is the best suited for showing off the potential of the multiplayer component. In this mode, players are made to pursue a designated target around an environment populated with NPCs while they themselves are hunted by another player in one circle of cat and mouse. It's extremely exciting to pull off a perfectly stealthed kill on an unsuspecting opponent, and for this reason alone I could recommend Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.\nWhile this review may seem to some to be universally glowing, Brotherhood does have issues a prospective purchaser may wish to keep in mind. First, this game was reviewed on the Mac port. While the game has the potential to run just fine, Macs running OS versions Lion and onwards may encounter major technical issues with getting the game to run. The multiplayer component is also barren of players, leading to matchmaking taking very long periods of time to find matches, if one can be found at all.\nNote: Portions of this game were played in Steam's Offline mode.

AC2 was good, so in this game they copy AC2 and just add more distractions. And the game after this one does it again, but with even MORE distractions!\nI'll expect you know at least a little about AC's gameplay from one of the five games. And that's all there is, in this game. It's just... More Assassin's Creed. It's never boring though.\nThe story revolves around Ezio's fight with the Borgia. The underlying, hugely boring and complicated story about Desmond as well, but to be honest, no-one pays any attention to that. No-one has more than a vague understanding of it anyway. And considering it'll take 5+ games to reach the end of that boring and vague connecting story, why bother?\nSo is this game fun? Yes. If you've played AC2, and you're looking for more, this'll give you just that. If you're completely new to the AC franchise, get AC2 instead.\nThe free Da Vinci DLC is fun but not worth interrupting the main story for. My advice is: pick a few side quest storylines to follow, then do the main story. If you still want more by the time you've finished it, do the other stuff too.\nThe Good: Still fun, Assassin buddies are very useful, does what AC does well.\nThe Bad: More of the same, freerunning can occasionally feel really slow and clumsy, far too much\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to do, Subject 16 puzzles get mathy and really hard with little to no payoff in the end, UPLAY.\n6,5/10", "hours": 37.8, "username": "Coraz\u00f3n Esqueleto", "products": 134, "early_access": false}

Mostly due to this game having more actual \"game\" in it. Gamification is above all present in the missions that sport an additional requirement for 100%ing it. Sometimes it gives real challenge like time trial, sometimes it actually limits your choices to specific weapons or angles of approach but sort of works to keep things varied. And the whole sandboxy aspect is also what I liked.\n'Cause yeah lack of challenge, mostly in the fights (guards actually hit harder now and there's more of them, but conversely you get more efficient ways of killing them so it's still too easy), and feel of an interactive movie instead or something, is a beef I have with the series. I guess I embraced it though by now and even started to somewhat enjoy those overpowered fights. Still missing focus on stealth, but I don't mind it either anymore (I adjusted my expectations, eh? :D some missions ask you to remain undetected but stealth never seems to be the focus, really, you just charge head on or literally flick your fingers to kill every enemy on screen)\nYou still gotta love the parkour, rooftop jumping aspect, raiding tombs is fun too, there's a dash of puzzling involved tho not much, and story continuing present day and Ezio's day affairs still enjoyable, even though it doesn't really touch me deep on an emotional level.\nAbout the story... The side missions don't directly connect to the main arc of retrieving the \"magic apple\", they have more to do with Ezio going all \"I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I'm gonna bring the whole f*n' diseased, corrupt temple down on your head\" on the Borgias or, rather, living in denial that he fudged up royally and instead explaining to everyone that you gotta have more systemic approach rather than playing the cutting-down-hydra's-heads game. Hence all the Rome rebuilding, winning minds of various factions and citizens etc.\nSo the main story may feel somewhat diluted and I guess people mostly enjoying the story aspect may be bit underwhelmed. Like I said, I personally didn't mind and actually like the game more even though it seems actually less focused on whole assassin's creed ordeal.\nOh, and Desmond Miles in present day finally gets some of focus and action, after all ac2 was supposed to prepare him for some parkouring in the present day so yeah, he gets some :3", "hours": 84.8, "username": "Blue Award", "products": 857, "early_access": false}

The story picks up exactly where the last one left off (both in the past and the present), and the game mechanics are more or less identical. In some ways, the need for this game to exist seems a bit unnecessary (i.e. it feels more like the result of a corporate mandate to make an annual franchise than a creative decision). That said, it\u2019s forgivable if only for the fact that it\u2019s just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Part of what feels forced is the contrived story revolving around Ezio losing his Apple of Eden and having to retrieve it. But there you go... it is what it is - basically, a flimsy excuse to move to a new setting and do more cool things with a well-loved character.\nThe game takes place in the early 1500s, almost entirely in Rome. While that may sound like a reduced scope in setting from the prior games, it\u2019s actually not. Rome is huge. Like, really huge. There are also a few other places that you get to explore in some of the main story missions as well, so there is plenty of variety in the environments. As usual, it\u2019s a lot of fun just to explore the city and discover its secrets. Brotherhood also greatly expands the role of horses (you can ride them pretty much anywhere), and there are some fun combat mechanics added as well. The missions in the game are similar to those from AC2, so nothing major has changed on that front. The other primary mechanics introduced in AC2 (notoriety, blending, etc) all return here as well and are also just as good.\nThe main addition this game brings to the series is the titular Brotherhood. Ezio can now recruit citizens to the Assassin Brotherhood. As you progress through the game, more recruit slots are unlocked. Once recruited, you can call your Assassins to assist in combat or send them on missions in a sort of optional sub-game. Doing either of these things awards XP to the recruits and eventually they level up and become more powerful. Though hardly revelatory by any means, it\u2019s a fun new aspect to the game and is a welcome addition.\nWhile Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood doesn\u2019t really do anything groundbreaking or expand on the established formula in any major way, it is still worth playing if you enjoyed AC2. While it is essentially more of the same, at least it\u2019s a *good* more of the same.\nGrade: A-\nNote: I don\u2019t recommend playing any of the Assassin\u2019s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad).

A matured Ezio is becoming the driving force behind the goals of the Assassins, and will later on be able to command a handful of his own trainees. This forms a new method of approaching a problem. You'll have assassin signals assigned to you, which you can use to send one of your apprentices out of hiding, and attack your target.\nOr, when you have enough signals saved up with enough aprentices, you can launch an arrow storm attack, killing almost all hostile in the vicinity.

The first game was a solid start, but the missions got repetitive after a while. AC II blew me away with the number of things they added; a compelling plot and characters that felt authentic, interesting platforming sequences, and a real sense of humor!\nI just finished the story campaign of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and I can't decide whether I liked it better than Assassin's Creed II or not.\nGraphically Brotherhood is obviously better, but it is not as big a difference as the change from AC to AC II. Also, 3D gaming is really useful while freerunning around Renaissance Italy because depth perception helps me to know whether I can make a jump or not.\nI think I preferred the story of AC II because it was an epic narrative of Ezio's journey over several decades to train and grow from a rather self-centered lady-killer young adult to a mature assassin (still a lady-killer). AC Brotherhood was much more limited in scope, as it takes place over the course of a few years in the city of Rome. Don't get me wrong, it was epic, but I liked the tangible progression that Ezio went through in AC II.\nHowever, I definitely preferred the gameplay of Brotherhood. They improved on a few of the things that had been iffy in the previous games (like horses!) and they added some really great things as well. The big one of course is recruiting assassins to help you out. I felt like a total badass whenever I walked by a group of guards, raised my hand and whistled, and a moment later they were dead. I also became rather attached to the recruits, and it made me very proud when they gained enough experience to become full-fledged assassins. Losing recruits didn't have quite as big an emotional impact as losing people in The Walking Dead did, but when I accidentally killed one it came pretty close.\nThe endings of these games keep getting more and more mind-blowing; I have heard that Revelations raises the bar once again, and I can't wait to get there. One thing that definitely gave me the chills was the date that the finale takes place on. Ubisoft has intentionally been converging all events on December 21, 2012 and the final scenes of Brotherhood take place 72 days before that.\nSo if you were to ask me which Assassin's Creed games you should play, I would say all of them.
