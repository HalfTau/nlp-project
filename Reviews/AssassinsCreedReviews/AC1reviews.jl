The story focuses on an assassin named Altair who, after breaking the creed's rules, has to regain the trust & respect of his fellow assassins by taking out various targets, each with a different reason to be killed. As the game goes on, taking out targets gives Altair access to new & more powerful equipment, helping him be more effective in different situations.\nThe world presented in AC is very detailed and there are lots of little things to be noticed if you pay attention. For example, sometimes if a beggar is harassing you and you try to get away by climbing a building, they will pick up a rock and throw it at you to knock you off. Little things like this make the game feel much more alive.\nThe combat is good for the most part, feeling pretty responsive. You can counter attacks made by enemies, though sometimes it can be hard to time it right, resulting in you getting hit when you feel like you shouldn't have. If you become \"wanted\" and need to escape the guards, it can also be a little frustrating at times, since they seem to be just as agile and skilled at free running as you are.\nThe graphics are good, especially when you consider this game is 10 years old. There are some annoying colour filters throughout most of the game (think the blue filter in Battlefield 3, only different colours for different locations), but this can be overlooked. The game doesn't seem to have a full screen option, which is really odd. Though this can be resolved by using 'ALT + ENTER' on your keyboard. There were also several occasions where the game crashed, one of which was at a really inconvenient time for me. I would imagine this is because the game is a bit old now, and Windows 10  might not get along with it too well.\nOverall I was very satisfied with AC, and look forward to playing the second one. At \u00a38 I would say it's already worth it, but on a sale it's definitely worth purchasing if you enjoy stealth and/or combat/action games!\n7.5/10", "hours": 15.0, "username": "\u611b Poodwaddle", "products": 357, "early_access": false}

So your task is to sneak, climb, jump, fight and murder your way through some beautiful old cities in order to uncover and destroy an evil conspiracy. All of it from a first-person perspective.\nI bought it as I heard Assassin's Creed 2 was really good and I thought I'd make sure to catch up on the story first. I wish I hadn't.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThe game is gorgeous. The buildings are beautifully rendered, even though the human characters look very aged. (And they clearly didn't have fabric softener back in those days. Those capes - urgh.)  The \"Leap of Faith\" action is nearly(!) worth the price of admission in itself.\n\nSound: 6/10\nThe music is pretty good. Not amazing to the point where you stop to listen to it, but it's decent. The voice acting is all over the place. Some of the arabians speak english with an arabian accent. Fine, I can cope with that. English with an american accent, fine, we're used to it. English with an english accent? Yeah, makes sense, especially during the crusades. But seriously, an australian accent??? During the crusades? I'm sorry, but I just can't suspend disbelief that far. Maybe it's me.\nStory: 3/10\nSo there is a story in it. It gets fleshed out the tiniest bit once every half hour of playing. Essentially because there really isn't that much story in it to go around. The characters are OK, but it just feels like an excuse to show off the graphics abilities of the console it was ported from.\nFun: 2/10\nOh, boy. Where to start? It starts off pretty OK. You go to a pretty city and lo and behold, a lady in distress. Fie, evildoers! I chase off 4 minions with my sword and save her. What's around the next corner, I wonder? Another lady in distress? OK, right, I'll chase off those 4 minions again. No problem. What will the game bring next. \"Help me, please!\" Wait, seriously?\nThe first half an hour of the game is fine. After that it ceases being a game and starts being a chore instead. The missions just aren't that varied and more time is spent moving from place to place anyway.\nYou may have heard people complain that the boss fights are just more of the same minions, but this is only partly true. There is one boss so evil and heinious, it is nearly impossible to defeat. This villain is the person who designed the controls for this game. Running from a lynch crowd who want to stabby-stab you to death uses the same button as jumping up on a rock, waving your arms and shouting \"Hey, look at me! I'm a gargoyle!\" So when you're running, better stay away from rocks or you will get stabbed.\nAnd then there is the pleasure of wishing to do a mission on the far side of the map. After sneaking, stabbing & running through town to get there, you start the mission. Then halfway through, the game crashes and you have to start over from the other side of town and do it again. FFS.\nOur hero jumps, spins and dances. Occasionally also in the direction you want him to. The combat system is atrocious. You don't really have a reliable way of selecting a target which becomes particularly tedious near the end, where your hero kills 9 minions, jumps towards the 10th, and oops, lands outside the playable area. You have died. Start again.\nOh, and not to mention the menu at the top shows that \"right\" means drop. And you push it and push it and your hero is just standing and grabbing open air becaause seemingly right meant grab here even if it says \"drop\". Oh, and let's not forget about him attacking walls when you push the \"attack\" button while surrounded by enemies. This game is really really bad.\nIt gets one point for the leap of faith, and one for the gleeful feeling of running from a horde of soldiers, jumping into a hideout and seeing them all running past you.\nPenalties: -3/-10\nBad controls. Game crashing bugs. And what the heck is it with that logging out procedure? In order to stop the game and exit to windows, I have to pause the game. Leave the simulation in the game. Pause the game again. Select exit. Select my profile. Push a button. And then I get the chance to exit to Windows.\nOn the plus side, I haven't had any DRM issues with it.\nIt is beautiful and the cities are built with love and care for details. I really wish I could recommend it. But I can't. The game stinks. Playing it is a downright frustrating experience. Might have been better on console, I don't know. Gonna try Assassin's Creed 2 now.

Freerunning should be the main way of travelling in game, but it rapidly becomes frustating enough to just choose to just walk or run like a normal person.\nThe combat system is too stupid, every enemy has a specific tecnique they're weak to, there's no skill involved, no finesse, no acrobatics, no use of the enviroment, enemies don't adapt to your tactics and it all becomes boring too fast.\nStealth mechanics are the same, just a repetition of the same set of simple challenges over and over.\nThe story is very poor, characters are flat and their voice acting is just plain stereotyped and racist. There's no real story progression up till the very end of the game, because there's no real story to tell, just a bunch of nonsense conspiracy theory that you would find in a creepypasta.\nAnd all those colectibles, challenges and side missions are pointless, pointless as in there's no actual value in them, no reason to do them, they are not fun, they don't really add nothing to the storytelling, just more useless grind.", "hours": 21.9, "username": "War Wizard", "products": 1002, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Go to a city, unlock a new section of the city to explore, unlock all viewpoints, save citizens, do the missions to learn about your target, kill target. Repeat this about 9 different times and that's most of the game. The ending though was honesty a shocker for me (as cheesy as it is) and really raps up the story and makes me want to see more!\nI liked what they tried to do in here though. They make you like an actual assassin, learning from many different ways about your target. Becids the, \"im too lazy to kill these guys...can you kill them for me?\" missions, I liked them.\nThe guards must also be spoken about in this game. THEY GET REALLY ANNOYING! You nearly bump into them... then the whole city gard seems to be running in to attack you. What makes it more annoying is that the combat is a lot more slower paced (taking extra time when more guards seem to respawn around every corner). It is more challenging, giving you combos to take them down easily, but I found it difficult trying to do them with my keyboard.\nOptimization seemed to be another problem with this game. This game suffers in window mode!! The mouse on your computer will still be moving around and clicking during game play. In other words, as you will be playing the game looking around, you can accidentally left click, and close the game!! I had many times where I moved the screen by accident, or paused the screen during a tense fight because of my my mouse right clicking on the tab!\nI also had a problem launching the game from steam, as the game kept crashing during the logo of ubisoft came up during launch (pretty ironic if you ask me).\nI only had gotten this game to run in full screen once(I have no idea how). When I tabbed out to check something on discord, the game entered window mode and could never be changed.\nThere is no achievements to go for in this game, so there is little to no replayability in this game. There is extra...stuff to collect after the story, like to collect hidden flags or kill hidden templars, but no reward after it.\n*IN CONCLUSION* The story is the only redeeming factor in this game.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 6, "page_order": 7, "recommended": false, "date": "2018-01-07", "text": "First time Assassin's Creed player here:\n\n5/10 - I can see why somebody might really like this game but personally I found it almost exactly the same amount of annoying as I did find it fun, almost everything about the game starts fun and then gets annoying. Ultimately there isn't enough story to justify it.\n\n1. Climbing and running (6/10)\n2. Combat (7/10)\n\nClimbing is fun for a while but when you're in a rush you start to notice the detection is not great sometimes, certain surfaces you scale too slowly and your character will sit there and stare at something that's right in front of him instead of climbing it. Generally bug free and smooth. He doesn't do well on boats.\n\nI really liked the combat here. You're rewarded for fighting properly but it's still easy at the same time. I find it irritating that you don't attack when you block a grab attempt and for some reason he only kicks the bigger characters instead of cutting them when he should. Also it's irritating if he loses his footing slightly during a fight he'll just wobble off the edge of a building like a drunk old lady and will refuse to correct himself until the animation is finished. Fun and satisfying but annoying at times.\n\n\n1. Assassination Mini-Games (6/10) - Mostly well done.\n2. Flag collecting time trial (5/10) - It's collecting flags...\n3. Sitting on a bench and listening to people... (4/10) - A nothing quest but it's over quickly.\n4. Following a public speaker around to beat them (4/10) - Tiresome.\n5. Climbing towers (4/10) - Tiresome.\n6. Saving Civilians (5/10) - Good because it's combat and bad because you get stuck in dialogue.\n7. Using people to smash market stools... (2/10) - A f**king s**t mini-game. Only saving grace is killing civilians.\n8. Get to person time trial (4/10) - It's a time trial.\n9. Escort person (6/10) - Suprisingly not annoying. They focus on you and don't run past you like some games.\n\n10. Then a larger story assassination quest (6/10) - The main point of each area. You collect information about how to kill your target through the minigames. Even if nobody sees you the alarm will magically go off by itself.\n\nI didn't mind doing these activities mostly... but they are tiresome after a while. By far the biggest problem is the game locks you into small cutscenes with NPCs that always say and show you the exact same things; you get the message after the 2nd time you interact with them, by the 50th time it really it annoying, especially when you being forced to listen to the NPCs tell you what you've heard 50 times gets you in trouble as a guard hits you in the back. The market stool quests are the worst, I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing hate them.\n\n\nBased upon historical locations, everything looks very nice. The atmosphere is almost ruined by the sounds people saying the same two paragraphs of speech over and over again. Also there are beggers who are like little Ubisoft executives, aggressively begging you for money. Luckily, when you beat the beggers to death the guards don't care unless you're in trouble anyway. JUST A FEW COINS PLEAAAAASE!!!!!??!? SHUT UP *smacK* HELP HE TRIED TO *SMACK SMACK SMACK SMACK*\n\nVery cool idea although it only shows up like twice a year for like a second and then it's gone again like my Father. About one page worth of story spread over 20 hours.\n\nThe silver lining is, if you don't want to play this game then you can just read up the story on a Wiki and start with the second game. It won't take you long to catch up.\n\nOverall this game is not a bad game but it got on my nerves as it does too much wrong and doesn't give you enough of a reward for your work. It's mostly competent where it needs to be and you might have some fun so long as you don't play it for too long.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 7, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-01-06", "text": "Here we are with the game that started it all. Assassin's Creed is an action adventure game where you play as two characters simultaniously. The first main character, Desmond Miles, awakes to find he has been kidnapped by the company \"Abstergo\" and only knows they want a memory from his ancestor Altair. They plan to retrieve it through a machine called the Animus, that lets you live the memories of your ancestor. Due to this narrative, the stories of the two characters are seen side by side in an engaging experience.\nThe gameplay is rather basic in some areas, but is enjoyable regardless. Mainly the combat boils down to pressing the attack button until the enemy attacks back and then destroying them with a single counter attack. While it is a sometimes unengaging system, there is something satisfying about mowing town twenty or so guards with just your sword. Stealth kills with the hidden blade and throwing knifes are cool to look at and done rather well. I like that in order to replenish throwing knifes, you have to steal from other criminals as they are the only people who would have them. The free running mechanics are absolutley great from my experience. Running from rooftop to rooftop and scaling insanley high buildings seems to flow perfectly. It only took the starting sequence to fully pick up and master the climbing.\nThis game does have a progression system, but it's in a very clever way. Instead of having the player loot items off of enemies or buy them from a shop, the player is given them as a reward for completing assassinations on different targets. Abilties such as grabbing ledges when falling are gradually restored as the game progresses. Items as well, such as throwing knifes, additional hit points, counter kills and increased sword damage are given throughout each sequence. Another progression gated from doing content is the \"synchronization bars\" which are basically hit points. The game has a counter for every fifteen \"additional memories\". Once these are completed, Altair is granted an extra hit point.\nThe Sound design in this game is perhaps it's biggest burden. Certain sound effects, such as the hidden blade, throwing knifes sword sounds and footsteps are ASMR glory, other effects are absolutley dull and sometimes dreadful. The sound effect when plunging into a three foot deep canal shatters your ears as the sound of Optimus Prime farting cascades from your speakers. The repetitive nature of the five note jingle when picking up a collective becomes nasuating when going for a 100% completion.  The dialogue from public speakers and beggars alike becomes recitable after spending a few hours in Damascus or Acre. The amount of times Altair was called an \"infidel\" far exceeds the variety of mission types in the game. Sometimes I found that the dialogue from guards in combat sounded grainy and low quality. With how often combat happens in the \"Kingdom\" zone, this became super apparant rather quick.\nThe score sadly suffers from some of the same ailments. While the music is very high in sound quality, beautiful and absolutley nails the atmosphere for each city, it is very repitive. Each city only has two different tracks that play in the background. The combat music is different for each city, but is exactly the same, and gets old very very quickly. The track for combat in Acre is so boring and unintersting. It's literally just four chords over and over again as a bunch of chavs swarm Altair. It doesn't help the already boring zone and makes any sequence in Acre absolutley dreadful.\nI always review visuals based on the year they came out. This game was released in late 2007, and looks damn good for that year. The textures are really good quality and the player and character models are also superb for that year. Another thing I was impressed with was the draw distance. I rarely couldn't see something in the distance if I was on the other side of the city. The Color palettes in Jerusalem and Damascus are absolutley gorgeous and bring the zones to life. These cites feel like a flourashing, vibrant, world due to these visual effects. Acre and the Kingdom, however, suffer from what I call \"Fallout 3 syndrome\". The developers thought it would be a good idea to put a nasty\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665grey filter and color pallete over these two zones. Luckily for Fallout 3 there is a mod to deal with this issue, but these games not as much. These zones became absolutley disgusting due to these graphics, horrible music, and annoying british chavs and hags gabbering into a microphone. The flaws really begin to pour in when going for a 100% and having to study the environment. Acre and the kingdowm were absolutley dreadful and horrible due to the above statements.\nOh boy. This game has\nof content. The issue with said content is that it is EXTREMELY REPETITIVE. Even main missions all boil down to the exact same fomula. You beat a guy up, pickpocket from a guy, eavesdrop on a guy (Which is just sitting on a bench and pressing a button), gathering flags, and assasinating two guys. Then after all that, you can go do the only unique missions in the game of assasssinating your target, although only three of the above are necessary to complete to begin the assassination. In terms of \"side content\" You are stuck with climbing towers, killing guards to save citizens, killing templars and Gathering a metric \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 TON of flags. Sometimes, doing the main content begins to feel like a drag and a chore, Doing the side content is a whole new beast. It's so bad that I didn't really even enjoy my last eleven hours of gameplay. Scaling a tower for the 50th time is not fun or engaging. Saving an old man from five guards and then him saying your reward is \"his sons knowing of your true bravery\" is not engaging or fun. Playing hide and go seek with flags is fun at first, but after a zone becomes dreadful. The templars are the only side activity I found to be consistently fun. I've accidently discovered them a few times and was shocked as Altair went flying into a wall. All this becomes worst if you decide to do it at the end of  the game, and find out there is no free roaming mode. A previous memory must be loaded to access the game. Al Mualim's lectures are great and all, but not after hearing it for the tenth time in a row.\nThis game had two bugs, one gamebreaking, and one issue. The issue is that if you decide to check discord and ALT TAB from the game, it goes to windowed mode. From no humanly way I saw, could this be reversed. There was no graphics option to fix it, it is just stuck that way. The only way to fix this is two restart the game and with the annoying issue of memory loading, it became dreadful to tab out of the game. The first bug I encountered only happened once and was minor. During combat, I was countered by an enemy and couldn't get off the ground. I just layed there and couldn't move as all the cities guards started killing each other in confusion of trying to hit me. The only solution was to restart the memory. The final and worst of all is the \"bugged collectibles\" in this game. That's right, I didn't even get a 100% because this game has a bug where a flag won't count on the counter and there is no way to fix it. I noticed the counter was stuck and didn't change, so five mintues later i looked it up and i was disgusted. I searched the entire poor district three times with a guide and cannot find the last hospitilar flag. I was upset that I trudged through getting all the flags and templars for nothing as I couldn't even get the 100%. Very nasty bug that somehow wasn't patched.\nAssassin's Creed suffers mainly from reptitiveness, but is still a great experience for it's fun gameplay and amazing plot.\nScore:\nPick it up on Sale.", "hours": 38.5, "user_id": "76561198067410547", "username": "Bobino", "products": 272, "early_access": false}

Everyone who sees you murder him runs screaming, and when the guards come you dispatch them as well! And their buddies! Yeahhh, I know I'm supposed to run until I've broken your line of sight, but dude - Schleck!!!!! What line of sight? You're dead!\nOhhhh myyy. What a blast.\nDesmond.... who? what? You're in the modern world, accessing ancient DNA memories of some ancestral assassin, who has lost his skills.... which you slowly get back.... so there's two distinct times 'n' places: one in mediaeval Jerusalem and surrouding areas (full templars, Arabs, and European Crusaders going on), where you traverse the beauutiful cities going on killfest missions... and rampages!\nThen there's another world: after every major assassination you wake up in the modern world. This is... amazing, full of intrigue.... the 'animus' in which Desmond accesses his memories accounts for a bunch of game conventions (instant / no time between game elements like travel or preparing for an assassination, Desmond's lack of actually being an assassin, parts of the map being inaccessible (just walled off with computery effects), how 'dying' is dealt with - 'memory out of synch, reloading' :D and the intrigue of why this is all going on.... the whole 'ancient / modern / ancient' thing was a beautiful offset, I'd never seen that in a game before and thought it was a wonderful element.\nIn the modern world a much smaller story plays out.... a story which.... sucks! After all that gorgeousness and intrigue, you get no satisfactory ending, which puts a downer on the game's conclusion.\nThis gives a strange effect. This game is aaaabsolutely amazing.... and yet... sooomething.... doens't sit right by the end. It's as if you get used to how awesome it is. You get spoiled while playing it.\nAs well, around the second to last assassination, things are becoming a liiiiiiidle samey.... schlecking people is still satisfying, but you do have to run away from increasingly big armies of guards, who are increasingly skilled ><\nBack in chapter 1 you announced yourself at the gates of Jerusalem by slaughtering the guards, and walked in like you owned the place. Try that in ch 5! Dammit, the game forces you to play it the way it's supposed to be played ><\nGameplay goes like this: get the mission, be given a new skill, train in the skill if you want, go out to the world. The guy at the Assassin's Beareau gives you a bunch of leads..... you go out, climb to high points, and get the map cleared around said high points to reveal side missions (brawls with the guards :) as well as the locations of your informants.... who will be little games like, pickpocket someone, race across the rooftops to a given location in a certain amount of time, kill x many people without drawing attention in just a few minutes, eavesdrop, beat info out of someone....) ... and...\n...the game is awesome, it looks fantastic, it plays fantastic... but...\nBut.... I've looked at other reviews of this, and you tend to see the same thing '25 hours gameplay' .... that's it.... in just 25 hours, it's rinsed out, and even starting to feel repetitive - beaurau / climb / rescue citizen / climb /  do other sidequest which is a variant on one you did before / climb / rescue citizen / climb / sidequest like one you did before.... got enough info! Back to the bureau. At last! omg, cleared this damn map by climbing and looking, rescued every citizen, throttled every informant, now I get to schleck someone!\nI'm kinda glad it stopped where it did.... the freshness of it all was waning, tho I reeeally wanted to see what happened next, both in the past and the present storylines, 's just..... idk maaan, 25 hours to complete, feelin' a liiiidle repetitive, and no satisfactory conclusion to the modern day part of the story (where you end the game).... rah.... something doens't feel quite right about all this.\nI don't know where the ancestral assassins' character development came from either. He started out a prize twonk, and for some reason turned into a bit of a goody by the end...  you know... after slaughtering half of the middle east... like that's gonna give you deep seated reasons to develop a conscience. Eh... his maturing as a person had nothing to do with me, fraaaa, me and him were merciless!\nI think what I'm trying to say is that the storytelling is unsatisfactory. It's a game with aaaaaalll the bells 'n' whistles, graphics, gameplay, viciousness, it ticks a million boxes. Plus, this first AC is iconic, it's a gaming landmark, everyone should have it.\nBut the raison d'etre, the whyyyys of it all, just kinda dribble out at the end. The inane character arc and lack of solid conclusion to the story make this feel like you dipped your toe in... and ya kinda did! 25 hours, rah.\nI'm giving it a thumbs-up, I loved it, but the 'this is gettin' samey - ooh! it's over!' thing does taint it some.", "hours": 35.8, "user_id": "76561198068141034", "username": "Wanu", "products": 46, "early_access": false}

It spawned 9 sequels and 17 spin-offs, but was it a good game?\nFirstly, the presentation. Assassin's Creed nailed the setting straight on the head, faithfully recreating the Third Crusade and creating a very atmospheric experience that later entries in the series have struggled to match. Each city has its own unique flavour and the whole game is rendered beautifully for its time using Ubisoft's brand new Anvil engine. This game was one of the most graphically advanced games of its day. I wish I could say the same about the immersion. Although the atmosphere is great, the immersion is often killed by low-quality audio files such as fuzzy NPC dialogue, or the fact that the HUD covers about a quarter of the screen (there may be an option to change this though).\nThe gameplay was actually quite innovative for its day. The idea of hiding in plain sight without the use of a disguise was not really explored until this game came out. Also, the free-running mechanics were great and fun to use. However, the combat is really just too easy, as you can easily fight 15 opponents by holding the block button and countering attacks for an instant kill. This is probably why the game's later levels are so ridiculous, forcing you to fight 30 or more opponents just to add difficulty. This causes many of these later levels to become quite tedious.\nThe story isn't great, but it isn't bad either. You play as Desmond Miles, a stupid idiot who turns out to be descended from a whole load of assassins. Most of the game is spent reliving the memories of Desmond's ancestor, who is tasked with killing nine individuals who cause pain and suffering. It works well on paper, but the assassination missions cannot be accessed until you do 3 side tasks that are always exactly the same, so it can get repetitive, an issue that was fixed in the far superior sequel.\nOverall, I'd say it's worth playing, but only to give the later games some backstory.", "hours": 23.0, "user_id": "76561198272216142", "username": "ImNotYourBroom", "products": 87, "early_access": false}

A few mission types, repetitive actions throughout the game, simple revenge story, (that DOES however thicken) etc. However, I would definitely recommend playing through this game to get a grasp of the world, setting, backstory, and characters, if you plan on playing through the series. I wouldn't skip this point in the AC timeline simply because it IS enjoyable even in its bare state, and it isn't a long game.

Good story and wonderful graphics for its time. If you're just getting this game and have never played it, you will enjoy the story and the gameplay (most of the time, hopefully).\nWith that being said, I will move onto the pros and cons portion of this review:\nPROS:\n- Beautiful graphics with zero FPS drops.\n- Good storyline that will have you hooked and have you wondering what will happen next.\n- Fun parkour and stomach clenching goodness (like that famous Leap of Faith move).\n- Once you get the hang of it, the combat is extremely fun and challenging.\nCONS:\n- Very glitchy. There will be many cases where the game will disagree with the controls I demand, and I go flying off of something I didn't even aim for. I have gotten killed from Leap of Faiths not being rendered correctly as well. I also had an issue with Memory Block 0 where you have to throw a dude into a specific location. I would do so, and the game would brick itself and continuously reload the tutorial without the dude reappearing with it. I had to start over several times before it finally registered that I was passing that sequence.\n- Since I played this game on the Xbox 360 originally, I thought it only fair to go ahead and get my Elite controller out and play. Forewarning, you WILL have to redo almost every single control button if you decide to use a controller versus the mouse and keyboard. The buttons were not mapped accordingly as the game had intended them to be, BUT that could also be from me using an Elite Xbox One controller (which has several different buttons to map from) versus a standard Xbox controller.\n- You will need to make sure your machine is compatible with this game. Though it's older, it is still graphic intensive. You need a good processor (as it recommends, you will need at LEAST a dual core processor), and a decent graphics card wouldn't hurt too much.\nThe only reason I gave the con list more detail is due to the fact that I do want to help some people out who are considering buying it and/or having similar issues to what I was having. This game is old, and it has its fair amount of issues, but it is definitely worth the purchase regardless. You might have moments of \"WTF?!\" while you're playing it, but as I recall, the 360 version was like that as well. A lot of people have said AC2 is better simply because the controls are smoother and the glitches are less frequent (which is true coming from someone who has played both of them). Still, though.

I almost did not get past the tutorial. I had to go through it 3 times, and it was frustrating. It was at the spot where you had to kill a guard,  then another spots him, and you kill him. I would kill that first guard, and he would literally fly off the map. The other guard went to him, which was off the map so I was unable to get to him to kill him. I exited after 2 tries, was going to give up but tried a 3rd time: He still flew off the map, but enough away that the other guard did nothing but stand there. I killed him, tutorial went forward.\nOther issues I had were with movement. Some of the viewpoints were challenging to get to because of it. I would be literally grabbing the ledge next to it and it wouldn't get on the boards. I would try jumping and he would jump THROUGH the boards and down to his death. I finally gave up getting them all, but I got quite a few. Movement all around was very clunky and frustrating to deal with.\nWhile the game is very repetitive, it is enjoyable aside from those issues. I was very happy that fast travel became a thing after discovering the 3 cities. I probably would have quit if I had to travel through the Kingdom every single time.\nMain character is fairly boring, but is decent. I enjoyed the storyline even though it was fairly predictable in some aspects.\nThe graphics are still pretty great to this day, even with its age.\nAll in all, while my review points out many negatives, I had a lot of fun with it.

Now don't get me wrong, this is far from the best game ever made, it certainly suffers from certain problems, but let's not go too fast ok?\nLet's start with the few bad things I found about this game:\n-The game is, like you may have heard already, really repetitive. I won't spoil the story, but throughout the game you'll be doing the same things over and over again.\n-The combat: I thought the combat was a bit too slow. The best and quickest strategy is to just wait for the guards to attack you so you can either throw them to the ground or execute them immediatly. Otherwise you'll be blocked most of the time, especially in the late game.\nThe 'Meh' things in the game:\n-/+The free-running is just okay. As expected with the first game in the series, it's far from flawless and rather slow. Whereas other Assassins (except for maybe Ezio) will climb up buildings and what not with monkey-like speed and skill, Alta\u00efr will only just carefully climb whatever is possible to grab.\n-/+The atmoshpere of the cities is somewhat lackluster. People will respond to you and your actions, but after a few hours you will have heard all the lines the people have to offer. Same with the guards and the people who are yelling speeches on the markets (I can almost quote the entire text about 'The English King and his army of infidels')\n-/+The main cities you will visit are much the same. Acre is the only one that's somewhat different in style and peopel that walk around because it's ruled by the Crusaders, but Jerusalem and Damas are bassically the same.\nAnd now, the things I really enjoyed:\n+ The stories of both Desmond and Alta\u00efr are very enjoyable. Desmond's story is not as complicated (and downright awful) as it is right now and it wasn't boring at all. Alta\u00efr is also an enjoyable character. Not very deep or anything, but good enough. Which brings me to my next point:\n+This is probably the only Assassin's Creed where you actually need to follow certain rules. You HAVE to follow the creed, it plays a large role in this game (a role I hope to see return in Origins). Not only are you not allowed to kill civilians (part of the creed), your behaviour will also be monitored by the guards. So if they see you climbing a wall, they'll most likely pull a sword out of their\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and chase you because what you're doing is not allowed. It adds a sense of realisme to one of the most unrealistic game franchises ever made.\n+The setting. I LOVE medieval times, especially the period of the crusades. I also like how all cities are divided in 'Rich-Middle-Poor' districts, which I find really fitting.\n+You won't be beaten to death by appearences of famous people in this Assassin's creed. In fact, there is only ONE guy in here, who you'll only see once or twice in the entire game for less then 5 minutes.\n+Your assassination targets are also somewhat interesting in how they always tell their motives when they're killed.  Every single target will also have a significant build-up through the missions you must complete in each memory segment.\n+The missions, although repetitive, are still really fun and somewhat varied. I only found 2 or 3 missions that annoyed me because of either the controlls or how the mission was set up (I HATE the mission where you must kill archers without being seen. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 'em)\nI usually rate games by how much they irritate/bored me at certain points. I'm happy to tell you that I never really got bored of the game and I only got frustrated a couple of times in the 15 hours it took me to complete the game (with all missions cleared except for the flags around the cities).\nIn points, I give 'Assassin's Creed' a 7,5/10. It feels very different from the Assassin's Creed meta that started with the sequel and the good definitely outweighs the bad.

This is what I think of Assassin's Creed.\nThe game still looks decent for a game released way back in 2007, albeit showing its age in a number of areas. The cities themselves are wonderfully crafted and is a joy exploring on the ground or on high across the rooftops with the series' famous parkour free-running. The present day story, often dismissed as an unnecessary distraction, is in my opinion the driving force for the series. I liked the main character, Desmond Miles, as he is forced by the evil Abstergo corporation to use the Animus to relive the memories of his ancestor centuries ago. That ancestor is Altair, an Assassin operating in the Holy Land at the height of the Third Crusade. Altair starts the game as an unlikable arrogant\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665bag but grows into a compassionate man as the game goes on. This premise involving the Animus back when it released was something truly unique, and I remember being enamored with the game. However, the ten years since then have not been kind to it.\nThis game is repetitive. I said it. The Assassin's Creed series is infamous for its use of collectables and filler content to compliment its story so this might not sound so strange but unfortunately it is in the story and main missions that it suffers this. The story consists of hunting down and assassinating nine targets to regain your lost status from the beginning of Altiar's story. Each assassination consists of going to each city, one of Jerusalem, Damascus or Acre, speaking to the bureau leader and doing the same three or four activities to learn about the target and assassinate them. It sadly doesn't cut it in 2017.\nTowards the end of my run of the game, I found myself rushing to finish it. What was once a favourite of mine was now a chore to complete. This might sound like I don't recommend this game but I still do. The things you can do, the movement, the gear and the variety of missions is very limited compared to its sequel and beyond but the set up of the story for future titles and introduction to the series is worth at least a playthrough to experience it for yourself. At around 10 hours, it's the shortest game in the series.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 20, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-10-20", "text": "Assassin's Creed is a fascinating filler-fest that has very little to do with assassination.\nAssassin's Creed presents itself in a dual narrative.  You are Desmond Miles; a New York bartender and kidnapping victim who awakens on the cold metallic slab of the Animus within the minimalist architecture of the Abstergo Corporation.  Taken against his will, Desmond is unceremoniously greeted by the abrasive Doctor Vidic and his assistant Lucy.  As a child, Desmond belonged to a small enclave of Assassins; a secretive brotherhood of trained from birth killers.  Although he ran away at the age of sixteen, Abstergo has tracked him down for research.  A breakthrough discovery by has revealed that DNA acts as a memory archive, and the Animus as been developed and built for the express purpose of being able to decode and read the ancestral memories of whoever is put into it.  Desmond's DNA holds a secret of great importance to Abstergo, and faced with either being thrown into a coma and his mind forcefully sifted through, or voluntarily reliving the life experiences of his ancestors to assist the research team; Desmond chooses the latter.  Thus his mind is thrust into the twelfth century boots of the Assassin Altair.  Belonging to the Assassin Brotherhood located in the Holy Lands, Altair is a skilled but arrogant killer working under the direction of Master Al Mualim in their battle against the Templar Order and any other men deemed \"evil\" during the Third Crusade.  Altair's conceit leads to instant failure, and he is stripped of all rank and equipment, save for a sword and assassin's blade.  Offered a chance at redemption, he must track and assassinate nine men of power and misdeed; each assigned by Al Mualim.  What follows is a genuinely philosophical tale.  Like all people, Altair's targets, powerful as they may be; are men.  They have hopes, dreams, doubts, and fears.  The Holy War ravages the land, and Altair is faced with a line dividing friend and foe that is either too blurred or too thin to make out.  Are his killings just?  Are they any less evil than the acts commited by the men he hunts?  Are lies meant to stop the war any worse than the illusions that started it?  Much of Assassin's Creed's story may not rest well with a person, depending on how religious they are, but for the rest of us; its an interesting look at the morality and sacrifices men uphold to build a better world.  And that's before you even figure in the crazier surprises the game will throw at you.\nAssassin's Creed is a third person action game with a unique free-running mechanic.  Holding down the freerun button allows Altair to leap, climb, mantle, and dive in a ridiculous number of animations.  Buildings with the proper handholds are easily scaled and leaving the slower guards behind by leaping from rooftop to rooftop is a breeze.  Altair's actions are entirely automatic and based upon what you're running him towards, but aside from some occasions where the man does absolutely none of the things you want him to do, it works incredibly well for world navigation.  Climbing will eventually begin to feel like a chore though.  Furthermore, the trained from birth assassination prodigy can't swim, so stay well clear of deep water.  Altair can swing his weapons, block, throw knives, riposte enemy attacks, grab enemies to be shoved in any direction, and he can flee if necessary.  The combat itself is incredibly simple.  Altair's sword swings a little slower and does a little more damage while his dagger swings a little faster and does a little less.  The differences are negligible.  He can also make use of his hidden blade.  Usually intended for stealth kills from behind, sudden frontal attacks on unsuspecting foes, or drop attacks from above; the blade can be used as an instant killing riposte in combat.  However, the blade can't block.  This makes using it come at a price if you aren't spot on with your counters.  Even then, the combat presents little challenge.  The kill moves however, are instant, efficient, and brutal.\nEach assassination runs the same way as the last.  You enter one of the Holy Land's three cities and begin scouring the city by climbing tall structures to get a handle on your surroundings.  Scanning the enviroment from these heights reveals investigation opportunities on your map.  Each contract has six opportunities but only three are necessary for Altair to get the green light on his kill.  None of the investigations are particularly engaging and they repeat the same hand full of missions again and again and again.  Repitition and filler are the name of the game.  Tall structures not only repeat the same few towers over and over, but the automatic climbing means you won't even get the satisfaction of being challenged to scale them.  The assassination attempts themselves are varied in theme and target, but all come down to getting in close and pressing the insta-kill button.  After that, it's a mad dash back to HQ as the city goes on alert.  Players must lose their pursuers and hide by either concealing themselves or blending with the crowd until the heat dies down.  The cities are connected by the winding valley of the Kingdom, a wide open spiderwebbing canyon filled with more towers to climb but not much else save for the next facet of repitition.  For the absolutely die-hard collectors, Assassin's Creed comes stocked with no less than four hundred twenty flags scattered across the realm as well as sixty Templars to kill, numerous towers to climb, and several dozen citizens to save from the hilariously tyrannical guards of each city.  Altair is a murder powerhouse and can't go five seconds without stabbing five men in the streets.  By the time you reach the target you intend to kill, you'll probalby be wading in blood.  All of these distractions are best ignored, and the gameplay experience is far more gratifying if you rail gun it down the main story path while avoiding distraction.  Each sucessful contract garners a new skill or piece of equipment, and you even get to see Altair's outfit change as he gains more and more abilities.\nHere the game is a mixed bag.  From a visual design standpoint, the cities look incredible.  Entire metropolises loaded up on my PC in seven seconds and standing above them on some tall tower gives a great sense of scale.  Bustling crowds fill the streets and the environments are rich in detail.  On a macro scale, the cities are each unique and laid out in very hand-crafted ways, but up close you'll start to see a lot of familiar people, towers, buildings, and details.  They also fail to really differentiate themselves.  Although you'll visit the rich, middle, and poor districts of each realm; outside of color grading, they all just feel like another dusty twelfth century Arabic cityscape.  Animation is absolutley stellar.  It's not always perfect and sometimes things don't quite fit, but faces are highly expressive and filled with life.  Every single conversation in the game, big and small, has its own animation which lends an excellent sense of body language to characters.  And then there are the little things.  Cloth cuffs slide down upraised arms.  The shadows of clouds grind across the landscape.  Droplets of blood scatter from a newly whetted blade as it exits the opposite side of the man it was thrust into.  The game is chalk full of these things.  None of the music is anything I'd much care to listen to on its own, but it all blends perfectly to set the tone while in game as monks whisper and choirs sing.  For all the good it does, Assassin's Creed hits major technical pitfalls.  Entire populations will pop-in only a block away from you.  Shadows are so jagged that they might be used for assassination right up until you stand directly on top of them.  Only then do they smooth.  These things are unfortunate but not deal breaking.  Also great stabbing noises.", "hours": 23.7, "user_id": "76561198004162646", "username": "connordavisj", "products": 424, "early_access": false}

Almost ten years after its initial release, the game still holds its own against more recent releases.  The protagonist is tasked with various types of missions - not just assassinations - to stop his enemies. Although some combat and some stealth are required at times, our hero more often finds himself eluding hostiles and performing feats of parkour.\nAlthough the controls are not immediately intuitive for someone new to the AC series, they are relatively easy to learn and, most of the time, work well with keyboard and mouse control. After a while, running and jumping across rooftops becomes second nature and is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game. Since combat is not the primary focus of this game, awkward skirmishes with guards can be overlooked. Although there are a few restrictions related to the unfolding plot, there is a surprising amount of freedom in how to proceed through the open world setting of the major zones. Most of the missions are fairly straightforward and not overtly challenging, with some exceptions; however, the more challenging missions are optional and not required to complete the game. The major drawback of the missions - and consequently of the game (and other games in the AC series) - is their repetitive nature.\nThe protagonist, while not entirely forgettable, starts off as headstrong and selfish. He does undergo something of a growth arc through the game. There is no customization, per se, although he does grow in power and gain new abilities, and all the growth is linear.\nThe game is set in the Middle East during the time of the Crusades and revolves around a secret war between the Templars and the Assassins. While the premise is intriguing, its delivery could have been better. The story generally moves forward when the protagonist visits with the leader of the Assassin order for further instructions, but in between, when completing missions, there are only sparse reminders about why he is going about his work. The atmosphere, on the other hand, is wonderfully presented through the lively cities with distinct architeture and various types of citizens on the streets, even if interaction with them is limited.\nFor its age, the graphics in AC hold up well. The AC soundtrack includes audio tracks and queues for various activities, such as discovering a new point of interest. To play the game, I did not have to install any mods or unofficial patches, and with one minor exception on an optional task (turning Vsync on/off), I did not encounter any technical issues.\nNone\n7/10", "hours": 34.0, "user_id": "76561197973644224", "username": "Keln", "products": 279, "early_access": false}

With that Assassin's Creed is a great start to the series but has several flaws, game mechanic wise, story wise, and graphical. The story is very repetitive and seems to be only interesting at the beginning and ending even with an abrupt ending as well. However the game sets itself up completely for a sequel which is nice I guess but most importantly has very wonky and odd controls and several game mechanics are mind numbing and leaving you asking \"Why is that even in the game??\"\n+Great beginning to the series\n+Altair looks badass\n+Assassin's look cool\n+Assassin's have their own little castle separated from society\n+I love stalking and assassinating people in this game\n+Combat is OK\n+Decent scenery moments that do look cool\n+Several different targets that differ in many ways\n+Game is set up for a sequel\n+I love how clueless and\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off Desmond is\n+Eagle vision is a cool ability\n+Being able to climb up onto roof and buildings, etc. is so cool\n+I like that you gain a new ability/rank after every assassination\n+Hidden messages/computers at the end of the game are sweet!\n+I like that you can train after getting each new piece of equipment\n+No Uplay\n-Story is super repetitive, it basically goes like this: prologue/introduction, assassinate 9 different targets the exact same way, ending\n-The way the game delivers the buttons are odd, I don't like that I have to press 2 buttons just to run or press 2 to enable countering and other options\n-Graphics are poo\n-Several glitching models and NPCs\n-Felt that the lepers, drunks, and ill that just push you when you get close to them are super annoying and actually caused me to fail several quests\n-No side quests or anything just main storyline and collectibles\n-Saving citizen's wasn't really worth it what so ever so I didn't like the overpopulated amount of events regarding them\n-Several characters with beards for some reason have floating pieces of hair around their beard\n-Wish you could assassinate from a rooftop and or jump\n-I don't know why it's even an option for Altair to just jump off of whatever he's climbing. I felt like this was a purposeful act the the dev's made as it's recurring in several AC games to where you're climbing a building and you press the jump to climb faster but instead you jump off completely.\n-Sync points gave nothing to the map besides investigation areas\n-I don't get why you can have the option of finding more evidence on your target when you only need 3 to continue and then assassinate him but you can appear to get more around 10 or so, yet it yields to be utterly useless to get more than 3 and doesn't help it all\n-Every assassination is the same, find 2 or 3 pieces of evidence, report back to the bureau, head into a restricted area, watch the target kill or talk to someone, then hunt them down and kill them, escape to the bureau, and finally report back to Al Mualim only to repeat that 9 times...\n-Several stupid ledges or balconies that stick out making you unable to climb to the top of certain buildings\n-I liked the fact that Altair can blend in with the clerics but he looks so different compared to them and can easily be sought out, I mean what other cleric out of the bunch has several knives and swords on his body? I found this especially stupid during the assassination where the target was killing a cleric while you stood there and watched only inches away and yet he didn't notice you?\n-I don't see why you aren't killed on sight by all Templars\n-Even the time spent in the present were repetitive as well, just wake out of the animus, go to sleep, and wake up just to go back in with little of importance of dialogue\n-Felt that it was lame that the Assassin's came for you in the present only for nothing to occur but the Templar's basicly winning in the end of the game\n-Desmond just looking at the blood at the wall and cut to credits was such a bad ending\n-I don't get how only Desmond can see the blood on the wall through eagle vision... like how do you hide the massive blood on the walls?\n-I didn't like how Robert and Al Mualim had different fighting patterns than any other enemy that the game did not prepare you for and basicly you had to assassinate them with your hidden blade when they were on the ground, which yet again the game does not tell you\n-Altair's personality seemed very robotic and pretty much had no opinion in any matter just was a living and breathing Assassin and that's all he cared about which is surprising when Assassin's like Connor who is torn apart for being \"boring\" and \"monotone\" yet he actually had a personality and actual background\n-Didn't like that eagle vision required you to be standing still and also didn't find it useful it all in this game\n-Throwing knives were pretty useless when you could only use them in combat\n-Really hated how there were basically no cutscenes and every cinematic moment you could walk in and ruin by looking like a fool as well as the \"glitches\" to change the perspectives happened to often and would rather the game do itself\n-Annoying how you have to stay hidden in hay bales and other hiding spots for a good 5 to 10 seconds to lose your wanted level\n-Mini map sorta useless\n-No Steam achievements\n-Flags were a huge waste of time and served literally no point\n-Combat system isn't fun so I found the constant fights before Robert and in Masyaf at the end of the game really lame\n-Altair is very less balanced than many of the other Assassins in the other games and I found him falling off more buildings and unable to make certain jumps that would never happen in other games\n-I don't understand why before the Robert fight you had to kill like 5+ knights before facing Robert?? What does that have anything to do with anything I felt like it was suppose to be a 1v1 duel\n-The fight against the fake Robert was super annoying with the constant arrow rain that you couldn't avoid\n-Why do citizens live in solitude with the Assassin\u2019s? Are the streets of the nearby cities that bad that they need that much kind of protection? I felt it more stupid as I can assume many got slaughtered when the Templars attacked and felt that it only put them in more trouble as they literally live IN FRONT OF the giant Assassin's castle\n-After you beat the game you are unable to replay through anything and have to start a new save file if you want to play the game again\nI love the AC series and I felt that this game did have a good location and characters. However getting the story across just was to repetitive and almost made it like a Hitman game as majority of the game had you just killing specific targets. With the fact that the ending is very abrupt and leads to far up for a sequel then to give an actual ending to the story. The time in the present was useless and added very little story and the game mechanics were annoying as a lot of times they would do the opposite or require you to press 2 buttons at once just to do one thing. Several bugs and glitches and overall bad graphics with the super repetitive and bleak storyline. I\u2019d say you can definitely skip this AC even though it\u2019s the first it\u2019s clearly missing a lot, because of that and even found myself at the beginning of the game struggling to continue as it just seemed so boring.", "hours": 9.7, "username": "Pake", "products": 103, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Alongside games like Grand Theft Auto 4, Mass Effect and Mirror's Edge, greatly shook up conventions in what action adventure games could really be. It innovated heavily in terms of technology, rendering highly detailed environments with dozens of npcs on the screen at any one time. And featured things we hadn't really seen before, like crowd dynamics where NPCs react differently based on how quickly you move near them. The 7th generation of consoles was like Santa's workshop for developers and we were all eager to see what was under the Christmas tree.\nNaturally the original Assassin's Creed is very overlooked today. The historical context of the title is long forgotten and it is considered very bare compared to its sequels. What remains is a very interesting relic of a different era, both in it subject matter and its gameplay.\nYou play as Altair, an assassin of the Levantine order during the third crusade. He is given the names of 9 targets, and upon killing them will redeem his name during a botched mission you observe during the prologue. Altair is noticeably less charismatic than the later main characters in the series and the plot is noticeably more low key. I will say it's to this games benefit if you are interested in the history of the time period. The game is steeped in atmosphere and the plot, while fairly goofy does keep your attention if you're invested in it. If you are fascinated by this period of history it is a very enjoyable experience all around but if you're interested in it more as an aesthetic it probably will not keep your attention.\nIn terms of gameplay Assassin's Creed 1 is the most bare in the series. Side missions are more mandatory and repetitive, constituting the same mission types over and over. Thankfully the PC version does switch things around with adding additional missions that involve races across rooftops and a few others that break up the tedium here and there. Combat is also noticeably less fluid than later games, relying much more on visually watching enemy animations to know when to counter and when to dodge. It's one of those things that you eventually get used to but if you've already played the sequel you'll find this somewhat jarring.\nAt the same time this is a game steeped in personality and is significantly more nuanced than later titles, which swerved more into high fantasy and high camp. If you're a history buff or interested more in the historical context of the title I do recommend this game. But if you're more interested in just another open world action game I'd direct you to look into getting the sequel instead.", "hours": 1.8, "username": "Silly/byte/", "products": 585, "early_access": false}

Is it really good. No. Besides the obviously gorgeous art and the now formulaic gameplay, looking at the game structure and features that could be considered bugs with older eyes the game just doesn't really impress.\nI've died several times now due to being pushed into the water by a drunkard, Altair, the master of Assassins can't swim. My most recent boss fight seemed to have me being chased by a kid, which turned out to be a woman in knights armor, good luck carrying that, not to mention having all these fully clad armored guys hop over roof tops just like me and I'm the guy with the special freerunning skill. Running up a non climbable wall happens, running into stuff happens, getting pushed and toppled by crazies happens when trying to run away from heavy guys. The fighting system is really broken in a way, just hammering X on my controller works most of the time.\nThe fully realized environment is impressive and nice to look at, but the fact of being in a playbox becomes apparent all too quickly. All the assassin's bureau's are the same place, all the high towers which have an eagle sit on them look the same, you will run across the exact same big brute guy several dozen times and just sitting on a bench watching people pass by will get boring super fast.\nOverall it's an impressive piece of work that spawned a lot of other material of which I enjoyed Brotherhood the most, but it is very flawed and far from perfect.\nUpdate: Changed the score from 7 to a 6, that final battle is a chore if I've ever seen one...

I can see why it would have been so good during its time, but when you stack it up against the sequels it is easily the weakest entry in the entire series imo.\nThat being said, this game is still pretty good, it just suffers from a number of annoyances. The controls are pretty odd feeling, and it takes moving through about 6 menus just to exit the game normally (Exit simulation, exit animus, quit game, press start, enter profile, exit game)... it's ridiculous. You can't swim in this game, so falling in water kills you instantly. So if you're leaping around the docks and Altiar decides to leap in a random direction you didn't intend on, sucks for you cause you're gonna die. The last thing that annoys me the most are just the drunk guys that fumble around the streets. They are just such a f*cking nuisance. They constantly go out of their way to stop you in your tracks or push you directly into a guard, getting you into a fight. And fights are tedious in this game because the combat is pretty bad (Wait for someone to attack, counter, wait again, counter, rinse and repeat). I know the early sequels followed the same sorta combat system but at least they improved it with some more variation.\nSo yeah, I just said a lot of sh*t about this game, but I guess I only said the bad because the game really speaks for itself in good aspects. Let me list a few: A beautiful setting with some nice scenery, some good story telling/dialogue segments, and almost 20 hours of gameplay if you don't include collectables (collectables aren't all that important in the PC version).

The premise is unique, the setting is really cool and the attempt to tell a story set within actual history is commendable. That story is also stronger than I was expecting, and the dialogue is decent. For a game that is a decade old, it looks... alright, all things considered. It even runs fine on a modern PC (Intel 6600K; GForce 1070; even on a 21:9 monitor). But its age really does become apparent in several ways:\n- If you think the \"climb a tower, mark an objective, execute, repeat\" get's boring in current UbiSoft games, buckle-up, because it is much more of a grind in this game. It doesn\u2019t even alert you to alternate ways of executing a target most of the time. 90% of them just let you know where 1 or 2 citizens need help, and occasionally a mission objective, all of which you can naturally just discover wandering around the city. At least Far Cry 3 tied gear unlocks to the towers in a lore-friendly way.\n- Combat is pretty pointless. Just time counter-attacks and you'll be fine for the vast majority of enemies, even though you're supposed to be strategic and run from large encounters. One time I didn't feel like finding cover, and instead laid waste to a small army out in the desert with virtually no effort. The most difficult and frustrating enemy in the game is the controls. I can appreciate that they dole out moves over the course of the game so you can get used to them, but you get a hang on them really quickly, and then it inevitably becomes repetitive.\n- Controls. Holy Hell. I was initially impressed with the way they organize the gamepad controls to fit with  areas of the body, but (like a lot with this game) that wore off early on in the game. Are you gonna climb that wall, or vault off of it? You gonna climb to that clearly visible hold-point, or just hang there while I pivot the camera around to try to find whatever arbitrary play-state you need to be in before you'll move? Are you going to run to sit in a hide spot, or clip the invisible hit-box of a person sitting there & ruin the whole thing?\n- They were clearly in love with the pseudo-cinematic sequences in the game, because they don\u2019t let you skip them. Not when you\u2019ve rescued a citizen and you want to bone out before guards see the pile of bodies at your feet. Not when you biff a mission (probably because of the controls) and you want to retry it. The only one I\u2019ve been able to skip in 12.5 hours of play is the opening, and only with the keyboard; not with the gamepad. (which is another control issue, but in order to play you have to navigate the first half of the menu w/ the keyboard, then with the controller. It\u2019s wonky.)\n- The game regularly lets you know that you\u2019ve hit a \u201ccheckpoint,\u201d but if you die you will get punted back to the same spot over and over. You don\u2019t lose collectibles you\u2019ve found or anything, but other than that the \u201ccheckpoints\u201d are completely pointless.\n- Speaking of collectibles, there are a bunch of flags and additional assassination targets strewn around the maps, but because they didn\u2019t implement achievements on Steam, they are also completely pointless. No unlocks; with few exceptions, no extra lore you can read through. Nothing. You aren\u2019t even rewarded for exploration with new information about your target; the only additional tips you can get are via the tasks you\u2019re REQUIRED to do before you are allowed to take out a target.\nThere are things in newer UbiSoft games that feel grindy, unfair, or just kind of out-of-place, but playing this game really drills in just how far they\u2019ve come in terms of game design. I wouldn\u2019t say that this game is pointless, or even without its fun moments. But if I\u2019d paid $20 for this I would be\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Luckily I only paid $6, which in Canada is, like, one beer at a bar.

It was repetitive,  all nine main missions played very similar, there was a ridiculous amount of collectible flags with little purpose and there were only four weapons. Yet, all the same, Assassin's Creed started one of the largfest franchises which are currently held by Ubisoft and all for the right reasons. Never before was it possible to parkour through such large areas and never before was there a game around assassinations done as cinematic as within this series.\nThe first game does pale a lot im comparison to the Ezio saga which followed, but I did have fun once more playing through this so many years later. It's not without its flaws, as stated earlier, but it does contain all the soul it needs to be considered a great game if not a milestone of gaming history.\nIf you never played it, it'll be great.

I really love games with a story I can literally sink in and where I want to find out everything about every character.\nEspecially when theres a big plot twist or several of them, hehe.\nThis mystery-never true thing is absolutely great.\nAltair is and will always be one of the best protagonists Assassins Creed have. He's such a cryptic character. That's why I think it's so intense to play with him.\nOf course the graphics and animations aren't good anymore but you don't play Assassins Creed for the appearance. Although the landscapes and citys are not ugly.\nThe only thing I have to criticize is the way you go through the story. You do 9 times the same thing, just with other persons or things.\nAnother great thing about the game is the parkour-thing.

The Assassins and the Templars.  Both of these groups fight for peace, but their contrasting viewpoints cause them to be at odds.  The Assassins want peace through freedom, and the Templars want peace through control.  AC1 begins in the modern era with a man named Desmond, who is forced to go back in time and live out the memories of his ancestor Altair.\nSTORY OPINION:\nThe game gives an acceptable introduction to the story of the Assassin's Creed.  While Altair was pretty stale and devoid of character development, I was able to let this slide because his character is that of a swift and nimble killer.  The game successfully shows the player the motives of the Creed and the Templars while also providing some background lore.  Altair's story is passible.  Desmond's story on the other hand... Well, I absolutely hated it.  The concept of Abstergo is somewhat interesting, but it seems so forced and unnecessary.  Why not just make this series a lineage of the different assassins throughout history?  Why make it this complex convoluted mess that carries over to modern day?\nVOICE ACTING:\nThe voice acting in this game was pretty bad.  The only good voice actor was Peter Renaday as Al Mualim.  Everyone else sounded like they were just reading lines off the paper, in order to get their paycheck.  No emotion and terrible delivery.  Something that was truly immersion breaking was the fact that Altair had an AMERICAN accent.  It just didn't make any sense.  He should have had a middle eastern accent like the rest of the cast.\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe map in this game is kind of odd.  It's this quasi-open world game with no real side activities.  The only thing you can do in the \"open world\" is collect flags and run into several enemy encampments.  The cities themselves are structured somwhat differently but they didn't feel that unique.  The combat is kind of entertaining, but the game is riddled with missions which are structured EXACTLY the same.  You go to one city, do a few quests to learn about your target and kill them.  Basically rinse and repeat for the entire game.  The end boss provided a cool, albiet predictable, twist to the narrative.  However, the fight itself was anti-climactic and disspointing.\nGRAPHICS/ART DESIGN:\nBeing an older title, I thought the graphics and art design were pretty stellar.  However there are some isues.  This game has a TERRIBLE PC PORT.  Terrible texture flickering, and terrible screen tearing even with v sync and G sync (yes I'm aware the game probably is too old to even use the benefits of g sync but whatever).  UGH UBISOFT.\nSOUND DESIGN/OST:\nThe soundtrack fits the environments you visit, as well as the action sequences.  However, I wasn't blown away by it.  The sound design was pretty good for an older game.  The clashing of swords, and screams of the templars were quite enjoyable to listen to.\nVERDICT:\nOld, outdated and bland is the best way to describe this game.  I'm sure when it was originally released it was a breath of fresh air for many gamers.  Unfortunately, as of playing the game in 2017 you will be disspointed and probably bored.  Unfortunately I just can't recommend it.  At last there was no Uplay.\n\"These are not children, but men and women full grown...\"\n-Altair\n\nVery awesome game! Fan of all Assassin's Creed games!

According to my experience, Ubisoft comes up with great looking games with nice storylines, yet they mostly suck at immersion and gameplay. This first game of the series is classic Ubisoft for me; I kept picking up, enjoying visuals, playing it for a while, getting bored of the repetitive gameplay and leaving it incomplete for a while... then the vicious cycle began all over again. Today though, I've managed to finish the game, and fresh out of completing it, I'm writing this review.\nIt's year 2012 - future, considering the game was out at 2007 - and we play as a bartender named Desmond Miles as our adventure starts. Desmond is kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries - world's largest pharmaceutical company. Unbeknownst to civilian populace, Abstergo is run by a secret organization working full on various conspiracies, and Desmond is to play an important part in one of their plans. Apparently, one of our ancestors, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad was an assassin of renown and a part of a rival ancient organization. Abstergo currently possesses a curious device called \"Animus\" which allows someone to reach into a collective memory pool shared by all ancestors. Namely, we can relive the days and actions of our ancestor... In Desmond's case, many centuries into past, when the Third Crusade hit Middle East hard in year 1189. As we live through Altair's days and revelations, bigwigs of Abstergo search for a specific piece of memory buried within our unconscious... which will allow them to seize great power in current time.\nThis game, is one of the greatest examples of frame tale storytelling that I've seen in gaming world: a story within a story. Shifts between Desmond's and Altair's realities, and their separate plotlines are really handled well, and you keep wondering about them both. It is obvious that both mysteries, even centuries apart, are closely tied and you'll be quick to realize that the war between Templars and Assassins started in ancient days didn't quite come into an end, even today.\nStory wise - which concerns me the most - the game is perfection. Characters are interesting, with elaborate motives and distinct natures. When it comes to historical conspiracy theories, I'm not sure that I've seen a better one. Actual historical figures, repurposed and reinterpreted into both protagonistic and antagonistic standpoints at the same time! Now that is a grand feat when it comes to be used as a literary device. It really is hard to define any faction as either vile or altruistic. There solely is a difference in between how they handle affairs. Dialogues between parties, adorned with philosophical and ontological discussions are not only interesting, but they portray personality features for everyone involved.\nGraphics are the utmost best for their time, with magnificent environment designs of Masyaf, Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem. Middle East of Middle Ages is really envisioned wondrously fitting. There are some lore mistakes - like the use of language, or some flags or factions being inappropriate for the timeline, but that part is covered with a \"semi-scientific\" explanation in the storyline anyhow. My only protest may be that the gray/yellow landscape of the region is a bit depressing to continuously go through, but there is not much to do about that.\nWell... aside incredible graphics that display it, the game world - supposedly \"an open world\" isn't that interesting sadly. One really shouldn't play this game as an open world anyhow, 'cause there really isn't much to do aside completing the main quest and admiring the view while doing so. Sure there are collectibles all around, but it really is tiresome, boring and meaningless a chore to go through all, and I'm saying this as a completionist! It bears no motive and the gameplay itself never changes. For nearly the all of the game, you'll go to a city, climb on some towers to modify your map, complete similar kind of boring investigation missions and kill a boss. Voila! You've completed another chapter, and that is why I've kept leaving the game unfinished all the time. Even though, you really admire the view and got curious about the story, going through the same motions over and over again becomes too much of a chore, and that kills the enjoyment. I do remember the hype about\nwhen it first came to be, promising an \"open world\", \"great stealth kill missions\" and wondrous parkour missions. Yeah, it sure has great parkour missions, some hardy stealth kills and an open world... but that world isn't as surprising or interesting enough for you to keep discovering. I strongly advice for you to stick to the main scenario, at least for this first game.\nControls and combat... now that's a problematic subject. Sure there are many creative ways for Altair to climb, run, jump around and slay his enemies but it all boils down to being - again - repetitive. Key combinations are not that hard, but controls themselves are really laggy. Sometimes you get stuck in combat while you should be running halfway through the city, and some other time you are more than sure you should\u2019ve blocked that attack... but it's too late. It is more than obvious that the game is intended for console rather than PC. Maybe it would be less of a challenge with a controller. I wouldn't know.\nIt's year 2017 - and this game well may be considered a classic at this point, both for the concept itself and its trial for an open world in an action adventure with stealth elements. It is a great cross-genres hybrid. If you are patient enough to endure the limited color palette and repetitive missions, you will witness the start of a really intriguing story.

They have recreated large open landscapes, and the cities you visit are faithfull reconstructions of the ancient Acre (Akka), Damascus and Jerusalem. There are thousands of npc's, living their life and all reacting to what you do at all times, this is very impressive, considering it is 10 years old.\nBut the port is horrible. Not as horrible as other ports mind you, i got to play it for about 4 hours between crashes and odd bugs, so nothing that truly made me want to quit playing, just get back into the game quickly, and do not get discouraged.\nthere is a general consensus about this game. It is boring and repetative, but if you want a taste of the beginnings of AC, then here it is, in all it's anachronistic glory.\nSo much attention to detail, that is often missing from newer AAA games, ubisoft really tried to impress us and take our breaths away, which they did.\nI don't want to go into details about game mechanics, because if you are a HC gamer, you allready know this series to some extent, and if you are not, then you still might be able to find something here to take with you, but it might be a little hard, technically.", "hours": 19.2, "user_id": "76561198068281981", "username": "Nyx", "products": 170, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 26, "page_order": 4, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-08-28", "text": "Pros:\n+Running on roofs, freedom of movement\n+Outside of towns, your horse follows you around and there are plenty of spare horses lying around, so you aren't likely to get stuck walking all the way.\n+Fast travel allows travelling between cities without the need for actually riding to them all the time. Though, you can't fast travel from just anywhere.\n+The world is sufficiently vast and beautiful.\n+Guards only attack you when provoked and you can lose the heat either by hiding or by killing off the guards pursuing you.\n+No uplay\nCons:\n-There's no clear way to switch between windowed and full-screen modes. Luckily, the game does start in full-screen mode, but a random pop-up or what not is all it takes to accidentally switch to windowed mode with no way to return to full screen mode without restarting the game. And in windowed mode, the mouse is prone to leaving the screen, which ends up frequently interrupting the game and even accidentally closing it at times.\n-Investigations for the assassinations are pretty much useless. A couple may give some useful advice, but the majority of them are either common sense stuff (such as, you can use scholars to slip through guards), things that can be discovered by just exploring the city or just arriving at the site for the assassination (such as, the presence of some scaffolding), a map that may be confusing to read, or just some random stuff that doesn't help you much in any way. The investigations don't unlock any special routes or allow special preparation for the assassination or anything do anything else special.\n-Limited ability for stealth assassinations. You can use the hidden blade to take out single enemies without getting all the guards on your back, but it's not really viable against groups of enemies. And all assassination targets are close to a group of guards.\n-Awfully repetitive. All the assassinations follow the same formula: do some side quests (which are repetitive in their own right) for info, maybe scale some viewpoints and save the umpteenth civilian if you want, report to bureau leader, go to the site, kill the target, run from the guards, report to bureau leader and then the leader of the assassins for a conversation, repeat. There's barely any variation between each assassination. If you get tired of repetitive assassinations, you could go hunting for the hundred of flags in each city that serve no use whatsoever.\n-Console-oriented controls. Basically, four buttons do all the actions and what they do depends on whether you're in low profile, high profile, or combat. Which means that if you're in-battle and suddenly decide that you want to jump on something or run (either to flee or to get to a better spot for the combat, or to use throwing knives), you need to disengage from combat to be able to jump and run, since those are high profile, rather than combat, actions. Also, you need to lock onto enemies to fight them properly. Not so pleasant when you're surrounded by ten or more enemies and they're all attacking you concurrently, since counter doesn't really work when you're not focused on the enemy that's attacking you at that specific moment.\n-Uninteresting combat. It's either just mashing the same buttons, or playing it safe and waiting to get a counter in, which gets hard against large groups, as mentioned before. And, besides it being common enough for guards to gang up on you, some story segments feature attacks by a large number of enemies in a confined space, forcing you to take on most of them at once. At least in regular battles, you can retreat to heal up, get to a more advantageous place, and reduce the number of enemies you're fighting at once. But not in those segments.\n-Illogical guards. Climbing buildings only gets you in trouble if you've already killed someone or you are venturing in restricted places, but galloping a metre or more away from them is assured to instantly provoke them, even if you haven't even done anything. Also, in some places, there are guards restricting access to certain areas. But once you get around them, none of the other guards will pay much attention to you most of the times, even if the area is supposed to be restricted.\n-No direct way to exit the game to desktop. In order to leave to desktop, you have to 1) Leave the current memory. 2) Leave the ongoing game. 3) Select your profile 4) Only then can you actually leave the game. The only direct way to leave the game is to either provoke the game to switch to windowed mode to just click on the X, or use other system means to close the game.\n-No way to skip dialogue. Hearing the same dialogue for the umpteenth citizen you save gets old quick.\n-Can't skip cutscenes. This is especially problematic when you've beaten the game, since you need to replay a memory if you want to return to the world for some freeroam. And each time you replay a memory, you have to go through the initial cutscene.\n-Lack of variety of weapons. There's only four weapons in the game: a sword, throwing knives, a short blade, and a hidden blade. That's not what I'd call \"a wide range of medieval weapons\", as the game promotes.\n-Pointless present day story. There are some scenes where you can apparently actually do something in the present day, but that apparently never becomes relevant. So the present day story is mostly just there to be a nuisance.\nTL;DR The game might have been cutting edge in 2007, but I can't really recommend it in 2017.", "hours": 36.0, "username": "gsimenas", "products": 62, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I admit, it's silly to judge a game without playing it properly but from what I observed, it seems the cash-grabbing sequel-popping has made Ubisoft forget what made AC1 great in the first place. A stunning game on all accounts, with a few irritating flaws.\nPositive:\nThe game's story establishes the whole Assassin's Universe, with you playing as Desmond Miles; a present-day prisoner of a modern-day Templar Organisation forced into the Animus machine that recounts memories of his ancestor, Altair, in order to uncover the location of a certain artefact. Altair is part of an Oriental Assassin Brotherhood, focused on fighting corruption amidst the chaotic time that is the Crusades, but having broken the Brotherhood's tenents he must undergo various missions to redeem himself. Most of the game focuses within the Animus as you step into the role of Altair. Both storylines, merging into one are quite interesting. A lot of material is covered, ranging from real historical figures and events during that Dark Age to certain fictional twists relating to the ancestor's experience. Despite a lot of content it still leaves just enough open questions for the inevitably released sequel Assassin's Creed 2.\nAll the real action takes place within the memory machine as the assassin. Altair, despite being a useless swimmer, is a Talented Swordsman and Parkour Master who can climb anywhere and jump meters down into haystacks. Combat is very entertaining, particularly as you witness gallons of blood ooze as Altair performs brutal counter-attacks from both small and large blades. Could this gameplay be any cooler? Only if you incorporate it within a massive sandbox world! The developers clearly worked hard to craft the landscapes. Whether you're roaming Damascus and Jerusalem, or riding the horse around the cliffs and country there is plenty to explore and breathtaking views to admire.\nThere's nothing to complain about regarding graphics and even sound. Whether it's the voice-acting, effects, or music; all are done well. The soundtrack consits of a wide range of styles, combining Middle Eastern ethnic sounds with electronic harmonies. Nolan North sounds like Nolan North as usual, but he still gives enough expression and emotion that makes it easy enough to feel for Desmond. Altair on the other hand, despite having a good voice often sounds very flat and rather odd that this Semitic person speaks with an American accent when no other Medieval character does (even the Crusaders). Nonetheless, this is passable when you take into account all other qualities.\nCons:\nAs everyone stated, this game can get quite repetitive. Main missions have very similar structures, with the only difference being the kind of cutscenes that play before you attempt to assassinate your target. Although the Director's Cut addition does include some extra side missions and the choice of when and which to do, it still doesn't feel varied enough. Fortunately the repetitiveness is something that was fixed in AC2, but for those that are really turned off by it well... AC1 is full of it.\nThere's another flaw that doesn't get mentioned much, and that's the tedious unskippable dialogue sequences. During the first playthrough I don't mind them for story-related purposes, but once you've completed the game and want to replay, almost every level starts with a boring cutscene before you can get into the gameplay. IMO, this is an even worse problem than the repetitive missions because at least those didn't stop the game from being fun. It's a shame because had those dialogue scenes been skippable on replay I would be much more forgiving but alas, is the reason why I add quite a few drops to my score.\nConclusion:\nEveryone's talked about this game, and of course they did. The game was very new for its time and had a big influence not just on sequels, but on other VG titles to incorporate aspects of sandbox and third-person exploration. AC1 still does it better than a lot of those games. There's a great story to tell here, and great gameplay to experience. But I won't blame you if you're put off from replaying the missions due to unskippable cutscenes once you finish the main story.\n80/100", "hours": 23.9, "user_id": "76561198010608791", "username": "SeriousStrelok", "products": 755, "early_access": false}

Seriously, I'm really not sure how the AC series took off, although I'm glad it did as the later installments are much, much better in a variety of ways. This is an older game, so I guess I won't spend too much time describing things in detail, so in the words of Inigo Montoya, let's \"sum up\".\nGraphics:\nFor its time, this game had relatively impressive graphics. The attention to detail from the water, to the glistening sun, to the  stucco on the sides of buildings, the graphics are one of its only saving graces, and I'm not one to care about graphics particularly if everything else is fantastic. The only particularly awkward thing about the graphics is the unnervingly jelly-like faces (seriously, when they're in the lab talking to each other? That was weeeeird).\nRating: 7/10 (for its time)\nStoryline:\nI was lost through most of the storyline. It wasn't an enjoyable story, and it seemed convoluted in a lot of ways. It's difficult to describe an AC game without giving away plot details (really difficult), but if you've played any of the newer games, this one is really nothing special. It goes as predicted, and they seem to be prone to giving away things that'll probably most definitely likely happen later on; they're their own worst spoilers. So a predictable storyline with little originality, filled with \"why?\"s leaves little to the imagination. For example, you're an assassin, and you're wearing the garb of an assassin, running through cities. Guards randomly attack you for no apparent reason and call you an infidel (because of your clothes? I don't know), but yet other guards just let you run on by, and NPCs that you rescue will \"tell the whole city of your bravery/sacrifice\" (thanks? I'm so glad everyone will know I'm an assassin, except those few guards that really don't seem to care?) - Honestly, there was a lot of arbitrary dialogue that didn't make much sense in relation to the character you're playing. I'd say the storyline was arguably the least impressive element of the game, and the later games certainly improved the creativity, flow, and continuity tremendously.\nRating: 4/10\nGameplay:\nOh boy, this game wasn't that fun for me at all. For starters, the controls on the PC are horrendous. The camera bugs out all the time, your character will sometimes jump in random directions with little input from you, the parkour elements aren't that responsive, and... you can't swim.. You're a great assassin, but if you touch the water, you drown. I guess if you don't want to be assassinated, just find an island somewhere and hope the assassin randomly decides to jump into the water? Problem solved! Anyways, yeah, controls are all fudged up. Activating things in the lab sometimes takes a few button presses to actually make it \"take\", sometimes the camera spins around your head if it's obstructed by something close to you. Aside from the camera and controls, the gameplay is really repetitive. You have targets to assassinate, and in between those targets in the cities, you just go around and do these side-missions where you might escort somebody (where you're always attacked), race to an informant before time runs out, collect flags on top of buildings before time runs out (why?), assassinate minor targets like guards without alerting the guards (sometimes maddening, especially when they're in the middle of a giant group of people and rarely venture away, forcing you to sit and wait for them to move so you can have a chance - there are multiple targets, so if you succeed at one and alert the guards on the second one or on the way back to the informant, you fail the mission). There are pickpocketing missions, ones where you have to save citizens from a group of guards attacking them (why? I guess protection money or something, I don't know - every group of citizens is always needing to be saved from guards). Sometimes the citizen saving missions bug out and the NPC disappears (not dies, disappears. *poof*), so you have to wander away and come back and kill the kind guards again.\nAnother problem with the gameplay is the combat. The combat is *terrrrrrrible*. It involves trying to time clicking the mouse with when the sword hits. It's difficult to get it right all the time and pretty much guarantees you'll be parried at least once with every swing (why?). It's so repetitive that you eventually get to the point where you're just clicking the button non-stop and hoping someone attacks you so you can counter them (they can kill you much quicker if you're attacking than if you just stand still without attacking... I don't know). They'll knock you down and sit there and wait for you to get up (how nice of them!). Sometimes you'll be fighting 10 of them at once (I guess quite often, really, depending on how much of a risk-taker you are). They'll chase you if you run away, clear across the city, and you have to semi-hide from them until you can actually hide in the conveniently placed boxes with shades scattered around cities, or the random piles of hay everywhere. They'll then walk right up next to the box, stop and act like they can't find you (REALLY UBISOFT?), then all of a sudden run back down the side of the buildings. It's so crazy. Oh, and you'll be riding through the countryside and random people will just start chasing you for no reason at all until you have 987439873498 people trying to kill you for going too fast I guess.\nHorrible, horrible gameplay.\nRating: 2/10\nSound:\nThe sounds in the game were rather detailed, except you'll be hearing that sword-clanging sound long after you stop playing the game. High quality, attention to detail. Music was decent and atmospheric. The only qualm I had was the absolutely atrocious voice-acting (hoooo-boy, it was terrible).\nRating: 5/10\nAll-in-all, I guess I'd give the game a 4/10, and really only recommend that you play it if you're wanting to see where the long (almost too long) Assassin's Creed series began. If not, you can safely ignore this title, or if you've played it before, don't waste your money getting it on Steam. I have plenty of unplayed games in my library and I'm slightly disappointed I wasted my time finishing this one, but c'est la vie.", "hours": 26.7, "username": "maliwik", "products": 853, "early_access": false}

While I encountered some weird glitches from times to times, those were more of the funny kind (guards walking on walls, citizens spawning out of nowhere in the middle of the street...) and I didn't encounter anything gamebreaking.\nThe layout for each city is amazing and it's really fun to roam the streets and navigate the rooftops. Likewise, gameplay for both parkour and combat is fairly solid despite a few hiccups here and there.\nThis game, however, isn't without its flaws.\nThe most noticeable one, I'd say, is that the free-roaming aspect is way underdeveloped and that the game gets dull and repetitive before you're halfway through the main plot. Each city serves you more of the same side objectives and the director's cut \"extra content\" does nothing to fix that. Each \"playground\" had potential for so much more so it's a real shame the different setting for each city and district doesn't make much of a difference. Why do guards unfairly brutalize citizens from the rich district the same way they do in the poor district? This doesn't make any sense and just shows lack of ideas towards more varied content. Even combat gets dull after a while despite the feeling of empowerment it provides, as you'll quickly end up using the same effective strategy to dispose quickly of enemies (a counter-attack with the hidden blade one-shots anything, even boss opponents).\nThe other, but less important, main flaw I'd like to mention, is that despite of its title, Assassin's Creed encourages you to play more like a mass murderer, and less like a stealthy assassin, as it provides you with zero incentive to play subtle. Successfully stealth-killing is in many situations downright impossible (not hard, it's actually meant to be undoable without getting noticed), and even when you succeed, it isn't rewarding. Most of the time, killing in the open any guard who noticed you will prove to be quicker and much more efficient than wasting time running away from them to find a hiding spot or an opportunity to blend in the crowd.\nThe story has its moments and intriguing hookpoints, but isn't overall that memorable either. Some dialogue scenes felt well-written, but that's it. Scenario could be summarized as \"Kill that list of guys and we're done\" (with a couple plot twists).\nI'd still recommend it though, because I enjoyed playing through it from start to end and it's nowhere near bad.\nPerhaps the fact I played other games at the same time rather than going through it in one single burst helped cope with the repetitiveness of it, but I'm also planning to go for the optional Templar and flag hunting objectives so I guess wanting to come back to it for that is proof the game IS enjoyable.\nOh yeah, and from what I got from the somewhat cryptic ending, the events in this one are a setup to the next installments in the series, so this alone should be enough of a reason to play it if you want to go through the rest of the franchise.", "hours": 25.1, "username": "\u30d2\u30b0\u30de\u30eb", "products": 1210, "early_access": false}

As you can see from my rating, no.\nDo I think you should still play it though? I suppose so. I, for one, do not like to play a sequel without having a chance at the original title that came before it.\nThis game is very well done overall for its time. The gameplay was unique and the features were different. The combat mechanics were different than anything I had ever seen before but lead to a very slow moving game in the long run. It is the moving mechanics that frustrates me the most. It is difficult, at least with a keyboard, to navigate the narrow alleyways while running at top speed. The character occasionally bumps into a wall and tries to climb it. When you are being chased by enemies this can be extremely infuriating.\nThe beauty of this game though is the story that it brings. While it isn't particularly the best story I have seen, it is very unique and leads directly into the sequel which is why I think you should still play this one in order to understand the sequel or at least watch a gameplay walkthrough so you can understand what is going on.\nI played this on Windows 10 and found it to be very buggy and crashed on occasion. This game is DX10 I believe which was one of the worst APIs Microsoft ever built. Coincidentally making its debut on Vista, one of the worst OSs they built. I tried running this game in Vista compatibility mode but the crashes never went away. I had to play through the ending 3 times just to defeat the final boss and watch the final cutscenes without crashing.\nI am glad I forced my way through it so I could experience the story and move on to the sequel but I didn't enjoy it overall and was more relieved when I finished it just because I didn't have to play it ever again.", "hours": 16.5, "username": "acdcdave1387", "products": 260, "early_access": false}

The game sets up, perfectly of course, an extremely lengthy (and profitable, at that) series of 'historical' discourse between the Assassins Guild and the Templars, who struggle for ideological and political dominance over mankind. While the series is played backwards through a machine, The Animus, in this game, 'popping' in and out of Alta\u00efr's world is not disrupted by the frequent 'snaps' to reality as Desmond Miles.

For a game with that hype factor I expected a stroy that would consume me and keep me wanting more after each and every mission. Instead we got a main protagonist, his boss and a couple of minor characters doing the Groundhog day type of repetition. You see your boss, he gives you a piece of equipment and sends you off to kill a guy but before you can do that you have to save citizens, jump off of tall buildings and here and there you have to help your assassin friends in order to gather information on your target. You have some pickpocketing missions and interrogation stuff but that is just about it. And for every single target is the same.\nGameplay\nThis is the part where the game redeems itself. Gameplay is fantastic and this is the main atribute of the game. Controlls take some time to get used to but it is not much of a problem. Very detailed open world gives you the possibility to do anything and go everywhere. The world is detailed, very nicely done. Fighting is very beutifull to watch if you do it right but if you make a single mistake it is a pretty frustrating thing to go through. You have to time your moves right and really be engaged in the fight. You can not just randomly press buttons and see enemy fighters drop like flyes. Charecter movements are really nicely done but Altairs walking is the only thing that makes me cringe. He looks like he is a male model on the cat walk.\nThe story maybe is not top notch but voice acting is.

Demo shows promised, almost the best game of the year. If someone for some reason is not aware of something, Assassin's Creed is a damn beautiful action movie a-la stealth-in-the-crowd in the scenery of the Middle Ages, with elegant duels, spectacular murders and parkour (where is Ubisoft Montreal without it?). The current release showed the other side of the game. Which developers without any remorse of conscience concealed. But first things first.\nThe first thing you experience when immersed in the brainchild of Ubi is delight. And wild. Next-gene graphics, stylish videos, a dynamic dueling battle system. And, being for the first time in one of the cities in general is ready to put the game 10 out of 10 and nalepit something in the spirit of \"beast game 2007\". The streets here look natural, townspeople everywhere, noise, din. An obnoxious beggar begs for a couple of coins, somewhere nearby, an escort of dissatisfied guards looms, a preacher talks about the path of salvation. Well, you just can not help but praise the French for the elaboration of cities. And yes, if at the words of the crowd you have the image of one of Hitman's missions: Blood Money (well, where the streets are full of bots with zero intelligence), I warn you right away - there are not any dumb people poking into each other and into the walls. Pushing a random passer-by, he will certainly send a tart note to Altair. Seeing the unusual actions of the hero, the people will not forget to comment on them. Having arranged a street fight, someone will raise a cry, someone will even get into a fight, and someone in general will quietly come on guard. The same beggar will throw a stone at you when you climb the walls.\nAs for architecture, in this regard, a tremendous work has been done. On each building you can climb on the windowsills, bars and ledges. Escaping from the guards, we are free to gallop on the railing, balconies pillars, bars, carts, bags of which here in abundance. Interaction with the scenery for five plus.\nLet's continue. And so Altair gets the job to kill 9 people. Our goals are hidden in three, differing in stylistics (like the gamut and the palette of the environment, and the architecture of the buildings) - Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus. The gameplay looks like this: we rush to the assassins' office, listen to recommendations, climb the towers, that would be highly appreciated by the sources of information, and after finding out everything we watch the chic movie and kill the victim. Hmm, for a start, not bad. We come to another city and there ... Everything is new and first.\nVariety ends exactly after you leave the first city. Bureau-climbing the towers-mining information-killing the target-again bureau. And so on until the end of the game, strictly according to this formula. Monotony and monotony make their black work. Assassins Creed gets bored very quickly and already in the middle you catch yourself thinking - you do not want to play it trite. Lack of enthusiasm in the gameplay does not allow to enjoy good aspects of the project. For example, an intriguing, non-standard plot, which develops immediately on two stages - in our time and in the Middle Ages.\nAgain, the combat system is almost perfect. Describe the battle on the blade can be in three words - effectively, quickly, easily. Laconic duels like here, in general, you need to make a standard, and then krimsanie each other blades (which we see in most games) looks already almost ridiculous. And of course you can not ignore the crown of Assassin's Creed - mixing with the crowd. It is implemented quite simply, but we have not seen anything like this before - it's a fact.\nTOTAL: In general, a sad picture emerges. Ubi sami also ruined their masterpiece, making the perfect almost everything ... and all this forgetting to tighten the rich, interesting gameplay.\nRating: 8.5 / 10Author: Alot", "hours": 2.6, "username": "Alot", "products": 149, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 43, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-03-19", "text": "Author's Note: I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed for around 4 years and I recently decided to replay the entire series so, here goes my review for the very first game. The one that started it all.\nBack before naval combat, Ezio, hook blades, and yes, even before two hidden blades came Assassin's Creed (1). Assassin's Creed follows the story of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad as he seeks to regain his assassin rank. Like the future games, this one takes place in a historic setting, this one's Jerusalem during the Crusades.\nBefore I dive into the setting and scenery, let's first talk gameplay mechanics. So, the game gradually gives you back your original weapons, as well as skills. The weapons include a sword, dagger, throwing knifes, and of course the hidden blade. The combat is pretty good in the first one, but it's definitely improved through the years. You can block attacks, counter, and dodge. Now, if you're used to the newer games, you'll find the hidden blade a little different than what you're used to. The hidden blade can't really be used in a fight, it's only really for sneaking up on enemies. The sword combat is fairly good, but like I've stated before, they've improved throughout the series. One thing that may disappoint you is the lack of the crossbow that you see in the trailer. Sadly, the crossbow was cut out due to the fact that it made assassinations easier, but you'll do fine without it.\nNow, you've got all of you weapons so, you need something to use them on. As you go through the game, you are tasked with gathering information and killing targets chosen by the master of the Assassins. This is done in different ways, and in different locations. First, you'll have to go up to a viewpoint and sync in order to see your choices. Usually, you have to complete three of these tasks to gather enough information for the kill. This information can actually be pretty useful and makes killing your target easier. These tasks kind of feel like mini-games and they're pretty fun! There's pickpocketing, gathering flags, and even killing targets. There's more than that, but I'll let you explore the other options.\nOkay, so you've got all of the intel, now it's time for the kill! Your targets vary from either sneaking into their base of operations and (trying to) stealthily kill them or dueling them. If you fail at stealth, then you'll probably either have to duel them or chase after them (Just depends on how much they value their lives). This is pretty fun and never really gets boring. In reality, the game is a little repetitive, but to be honest, it never really felt that way for me. Just enjoy the moment.\nAlright, so we've talked about assassinating big targets, now let's talk about their little henchmen. As you go through the game, you'll fight a variety of enemies, such as: guys with swords, heavy armor guys, guys with bows, guys with maces, and so on. The combat really isn't that hard and it doesn't take much to get used to it. The enemy A.I is fairly good, but sometimes a little laughable. They do sometimes pose a challenge though, which is always fun. Oh, and just like you, they can't swim! Looks like you're not that different from them deep down.\nSo far, we've covered killing, killing, and...ah...well, more killing! Now on to the scenery. So, the game takes place during the times of the Crusades (hench all of the Templars) in the area, and even in, Jerusalem. The cities you'll visit are fairly large and full of life. You'll usually see at least 4 people, usually a fair bit more, in most areas on the streets. The cities look great for its time and the game runs rather smoothly. How do you get to the cities though? Well, you'll eventually unlock the fast traveling system, which means you'll travel...fast. It's not too different from the one you'll find in AC 2, but you won't need a boat. As soon as you run out of the Assassin HQ, you'll get the option to fast travel. If you'd rather see the world for yourself, you can always travel by horse.\nNow, on to the last bit of stuff. So, the voice acting's pretty darn good, even if Altair has an American accent for some reason...you get used to it though. The graphics, like I said, are pretty great. Even the soundtrack is pretty great, it provides even more tension to tense situations!\nOverall, this is a really great game! If you haven't played any of the Assassin's Creed games before, this is a great starting point. You'll really appreciate the newer mechanics in the later games. If you've already played some AC games and not this one, this is a great chance to see what you missed! It may not be the best Assassin's Creed game ever *cough* *cough* Assassin's Creed 2 *cough* but it's definitely a great start to an amazing franchise.", "hours": 23.6, "user_id": "76561198153716024", "username": "Space", "products": 187, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

And that's exactly what Assassin's Creed does...for like two hours.\nSo here's my issue: it's way too freaking repetitive. You meet up with Al Mualim (hope I spelled that right), your boss, get berated, get a mission, complete one of many repetitive tasks (such as jumping off buildings and saving insanely helpless citizens) in order to even be able to DO the mission, then you do the mission and head back to Al Mualim to start the process all over again. Seriously. You do it so many times you easily accumulate over ten hours (even if you speed-rush).\nYahweh, Allah, and God-- I'm just as unfocused and ADHD as the next guy-- so how the hell was this game so popular?!\nWell, I've come to a few conclusions which I will highlight as the positives of this game:\n1. It's historically accurate\n2. Graphics are great. Still hold up after more than a decade\n3. Has an interesting premise-- which is hard to get to because there are so many mundane and repetitive objectives that get in the way\n4. Very diverse. Represents many cultures\n5.

I've played it and replayed it over and over since 2012 and it's still one of my favourite Assassin's Creed games. But my views back then were different because there were only like... 5 main games. So what do I think now? well...\nStory:\nIt starts off with Altair recovering an ancient artefact from Solomon's Temple. However, he manages to break 3 tenants of the creed. Once he returns with the artefact, the Templars track him down and kill the civillians and other assassins who live in the assassin HQ, Masyaf Castle. Everyone blames Altair for bringing them there so Al Mualim demotes Altair to a novice rank and makes him find and kill 9 templars who are trying to ensure the 3rd crusade continues. Altair kills all 9 but then the leader, Robert de Sable confesses it was actually Al Mualim who wanted to use the artefact to bring new world order. Altair then kills Al Mualim aaaand the rest is for Assassin's Creed Revelations.\nAlso there's a modern story with Desmond Miles but... not much to talk about.\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay in this game is probably the weirdest to talk about. It's not great, because the games that came after were far better but it's definitely not the worst. Honestly, I think this game got 1 very important thing right: STEALTH. Stealth is what Assassin's Creed is about and it seems only this game can do it properly. The fighting is a little bit clunky at times but definitely not as easy as the likes of 3, Black Flag or Rogue. It's only when I played it on PC that I managed to figure out that sometimes if you counter then quickly press X, you can finish them off while they're recovering. I also like how the side missions end up helping you in the actual assassination mission. It suprisingly becomes easier, plus it'll tell you what you should do.\nAssassination missions:\nTamir: Definitely the easiest. Just walk up to him and stab him\nGarnier de Naplouse: Make sure to stab him when he's talking to a patient. Otherwise he'll become Yoda and detect you while you're behind him.\nTalal: He just runs away... hold sprint and then stab him ._.\nAbu'l Nuqoud: Fat \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665er runs away and jesus christ he's like Dr Eggman in Sonic 2... faster than someone who should probably be the fastest.\nWilliam of Montferrat: One of the best targets to kill. Running around in a fortress trying to not get detected... niiice\nMajd Addin: He looks like Bin Laden. And there's a bunch of soldiers trying to kill you. Also quite fun.\nSibrand: The worst \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing target ever. He's on a boat and you need to jump on \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing platforms to try and get to him. Don't get detected or he'll run away. Mistime a jump, you're falling into the water and dying. I've played this game like 5 times and every time, this mission \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s me over. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Sibrand.\nJubair: This one is just... annoying. There's like 7 different people you need to kill and you need to find which one is the real Jubair.\nRobert de Sable: I used to find this one the most tedious. Both versions btw. In Jerusalem and Arsuf. But now that I basically know all the things you can do with the combat, I pretty much got past it in under an hour. I actually find it quite fun now. Cutting through a bunch of Crusaders and Saracens. It's good.\nRashid ad-Din Sinan (Al Mualim): Very underwhelming... although I do like the fight, it could have been so much better.\nMusic: The music in this game is really good. Very mysterious 'n\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Not as good as 2, Brotherhood or 3 but still good. Jesper Kyd never fails.\nOverall: The game is still good and honestly, if Ubisoft made an updated texture pack for the PC version like they did with Watch Dogs 2, I'd be okay with that. I wouldn't mind a HD remaster either but as long as they show this game some love since it's the 10th anniversary... then anything is fine with me.

However, on a 1 to 10 scale I would honestly have to give it a 5.5, but no higher then a 6.\nFrom my history of playing this games series, what really sucked me in back in 2008 (ish, I don't exactly recall the date) was from an Assassin's Creed YouTube trailer featuring \"Lonely Soul\" by Unkle. So there's Altair walking down an empty street in what looks to be the lone swordsman routine when, Bam, out pops an ten inch hidden blade. Yeah, there were other trailers like the one where he storms a hanging with a crossbow, but the song did it for me.\nSo, I bought it, and, then as I do now, I still hate the game. And I still love the game.\nHUH?\nLet me explain...\n- I felt like it never got to use the hidden blade as much as I would like to.\n- He never go to use a crossbow. It almost felt like a like, but whatever.\n- He will smack into walls as if he was drunk... constantly. I spent days shouting, \"What are you?...I didn't want to go that way? Why did you jump off that building? Did you have to kill another random person? WTF you can't swim?!!\"\n- He can't swim. Yes, the master assassin will drown in the shallow end of the kiddie pool, floaties and all.\n- The first 40 minutes are hell. In fact, I almost gave up just from the droll that pored from Lucy, Desmond and the Dr.\n- The game could have stood alone with out a the cutscenes with Desmond. And Ubi wisely turned some of those 'inner' scenes into missions that were more fun later on.\n- You're required to learn almost every new move he's given, which also slows down the game.\n- You will hate the hordes of NPC's running between you and the combat.\nSo, why even play it?\n\n- Boredom. Seriously.\n- It has a unique storyline.\n- I actually contemplated some of the philosophy.\n- Altair is a one-shot wonder with his throwing knives. He will kill almost anyone with one blade, too bad I can't say the same later in the series.\n- Sometimes when he turns the wrong way or runs off ledges, it's comical. And frustrating.\n- Stealing throwing knives is easier then buying them.\n- No monetary system, this is both good and bad, but in this game it worked.\n- The ending is was worth the wait.\nAs you can see, I am split in my decision as to whether like or hate this game.\nWhat really bothers me the most is after 10 years Ubisoft has flatly refused to clean up the mess of what could really be a great game. I've been fantasized about playing a \"remastered\" or \"anniversary\" edition of the original AC with the graphics cleaned up, better playability and--god forbid--enjoyable cutaways with Desmond.\nAnyway, that was my 2\u00a2.

Well, now you can play that dream!  This is a game about running, climbing, jumping, being chased, hiding, and then finally you realize the truth - it's just way faster to stop and kill everyone chasing you than it is to run away in the first place.  I'm not exactly sure if this is what the creaters intended, but it's cathartic all the same.  All the same, this is a fun little game with a pretty-good plot (you won't really care about any of the characters, and the main character is only kinda interesting...his artificial arc definitely isn't going to leave you on the edge of your seat...so just get back to the stabbing).  As a \"stealth\" game, it comes a little short because it really isn't that except for the fact that you do kinda surprise people by suddenly stabbing them, then walking away (spoiler alert!).  (I mean, that would be surprising unless you live in like New York or Chicago or Detroit or LA where you kinda expect random people to do this.)  As a console port, the controlls are hillariously wonky to the point of comedy, when your character alternates being being a master acrobat to being the most clumsy creature in the world, seemingly at random.  The fighting is pretty much the same.  This game does have some silly camera tricks, though it (generally) sometimes avoids annoying angles, unless you are fighting.  It has automatic checkpoints, but the saving isn't really a big deal, and it tends to save every time you need it to.  This isn't a difficult game, at all, but I think it's supposed to be all about the ride.  It CTDs very rarely, but it's nothing to worry about.  Overall, it's a better than average ride, all things considered.  Oh, yeah, I got all the flags and templars, which takes like a million hours, and do you know you get exactly NOTHING for so doing.

There's an awful lot of tedium, even if there's some great stuff in there as well.\nThe futuristic portions absolutely suck, they're tedious, boring, have no characterisation, and lend nothing to the story or gameplay. Desmond is the least interesting character Nolan North has probably ever played in this game at least.\nThe gameplay... sort of sucks? There are a lot of extremely frustrating elements that got ironed out of future games. Walking in a group requires constant button pressing to lock you in place, deviating from that cover at all will immediately make guards hostile in many parts of the game world. This can be incredibly frustrating in the more open areas where you'd rather move quickly. And in crowds where you have to stay hidden, combined with 'crazy' npcs that will shove you which registers as your cover being blown and the guards descending en-masse... well it is controller-chucking levels of maddening at times.\nThe camera sucks. This game has no cinematography beyond the occasional opportunity to switch fixed camera angles (which has to be done manually at specific times for some reason). This is a problem games have in general, interesting voice overs but nothing happening visually. It's very dull even if you like what your ears are hearing. Like watching a CCTV video of a conversation in the middle ages. I spent what felt like genuine hours of the game making Altair do pirouettes by tapping left and right rhythmically.\nThis game had a flow and purity later games lacked in my opinion. It also had a focus on the philosophical ramifications of its story as well that the sequels had no interest in whatsoever. While the future sections were tedious and entirely prefunctory the main meat of the story was very enjoyable. There was a strong focus on what exactly the Assassin's creed  meant, which was parallelled with Altair's character arc and his evolving relationship with a couple of key characters. The actual assasinations held thematic weight too, with the game exploring each of the target's sins eventually cumulating with a monologue from the villains as they lie dying in your arms (a mechanic future games have, but without the meaningful exposition being given by the characters) offering their side of the story and their justification for their actions, lending a final human touch to them.\nIt also hinges a final plot twist on something that initially felt like it was going to be a \"Wait, didn't they just?\" Chekhov's Gun that I genuinely expected the writers to have been ignorant of including, so it was a pleasant surprise that yet another video game plot hole was actually an intentional twist.\nThe soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is as solid as to be expected. It has a modern, electronic, style that later games wisely ditched (along with Altair's inexplicable American accent), but I confess to really liking it still. Particularly the pulse pounding track that plays after a successful assassination as you run from the authorities and attempt to regain anonymity, it gave every sequence a moment of \"\n\".\nAlso, as anyone who has played the later games already knows, the controller prompts for the PC version are absolutely bewildering at first with you constantly trying to work out which is the 'feet' button.\nIts a shame there's such strongly frustrating elements in this game as I feel like in some ways it is also the best Assassin's Creed, before the plot became empty hollywood blockbuster fluff and the gameplay became a sequence of distractions and \"stay exactly 30 feet behind this NPC without breaking line of sight for about 15 minutes\" missions.", "hours": 16.0, "username": "Gradius", "products": 805, "early_access": false}

Furthormore for the game mechanics and the missions are the best the game and series has too offer, it provides you with the choice and methods of how you kill your enamy or how you aquire information for it in whatever order you please. Also you go into the game nowing nothing about how the combat works but after a few replays of assassinations i found myself using the hidden blade and never getting a scatch as i badassly counter all my opponents moves.\nFor computing issues, there is none, you can play fine with little lag on even the oldest of machines, if you have a problem you can lower the building texures or turn off some of the non-nescersery parts of graphics, even still they look fine at the lowest level. But i suggest not changing the character textures as they end up looking heleroius and unreal on the lowest character textures, but that never effects lag anyway. But anyway you should have little problem.\nFinaly the cities are pristine and perfect, using real world buildings, such as the Umhyyad Mosque, Temple Mount and the Catsle of Acre. Also the cities up into segregated class quaters, containing many souks (bazzars or marketplaces) and dingy dark allyways. However you will unlock these different areas as you progress through the game.\nOverall a 10/10 game, a great show to how a game should be made, and i highly reccommend you plays this.", "hours": 75.4, "user_id": "76561198081196503", "username": "\u272eRev_Ellis\u272e", "products": 79, "early_access": false}

So I then played the latter half of the game. Even despite not playing the whole game it felt rather repetitive. The core of this game is you need to assassinate 9 people but before you can do that you have to go to one of the three cities in the game and do similar side quests over and over again before you can complete the next assassination mission. The side missions are in themselves fun but after the umpteenth time you can't help but get a bit bored.\nThe free running mechanics are okay but not as fluid as I was expecting. Sometimes you smoothly flow across the roof tops like in Mirror's Edge but then suddenly your character will jump off in the wrong direction or cling onto a door frame or flounder up a wall next to a ladder.\nTo get between the cities you have to ride through the countryside which just felt like unnecessary padding. The game almost recognises this as it allows you skip these sections later in the game. There are also some extensive collection side quests which are utterly pointless, there is no benefit to doing them, not even an achievement.\nSo overall this game was enjoyable and I am going to play the sequel but I found it a little disappointing.", "hours": 24.0, "username": "Bob", "products": 306, "early_access": false}

It is immersive, and gives you a real feel of the history and geography of the third crusade. The cities themselves feel large and unique, with lots of NPC characters.The graphics aren't too bad for its age either.\nOne of the main reasons I would play this is the story, as it provides a lot of the starting canon for the rest of the franchise. Each assassination feels purposeful, and taking a life has a consequence. Some of the targets I developed a personal anger towards when learning of their deeds, which indicates the strength of the writing.\nHowever, for the good there must be bad. For a start, it runs badly. Freezes throughout loading menus and occasionally in game - often mid combat which is awkward. The investigations required for the assassinations are repetitive, and tend to turn the game a bit grindy when you are performing them.\nThe combat for some reason I just cannot fathom. I appreciate not all blows would be blocked, but the counter system makes little sense in the type of attacks that can be blocked. It boils down to luck - or maybe I am missing something. Late in the game the number of enemies is honestly ridiculous, and when you are surrounded by enemies winning is nigh on impossible. It got to a point on a number of occasions when I rage quit and resolved to watch the remaining cut scenes online. The missions themselves are sometimes hit and miss, I can't tell you the number of times I fell in that damn harbour, I mean, an assassin that can't swim? Really?

Unfortunately, this legendary game, which spawned a huge franchise, has not stood the test of time and barely gets a pass from me now. The only reason this game gets a \"yes\" from me is because it's part of a series which has significantly better titles, and if you're interested in this series at all, I think you have to play the game that started at all. I assume it goes without saying that you should absolutely not buy this game unless it's on a big sale (50% or more).\n-----\nThe great qualities of this game are: Wonderful setting and scenery. I personally think the game still looks quite nice! Some may disagree, but for its time the game was pretty and still looks good now. Another plus is the game's atmosphere and story are very cool. Assassin's Creed, AC2, and a few other titles in the series take a fun creative approach to history and I very much enjoyed the storytelling.\nThat being said, unfortunately this game has a few major downsides which nearly made me hit \"no\".\n1) There are many issues with this game on current PC's. It took me numerous tries to get the game to not crash during the \"animus tutorial\" stage. Which brings me to #2...\n2) Unskippable cutscenes AND NO SUBTITLES. These are one of my biggest gaming pet peeves and man do I hate them. This game is a big, big time culprit of unskippable cutscenes and MAJORLY hurts the replay value of this game. (You'll notice I only have enough to complete the game and do some collectibles).\n3) The movement and gameplay don't feel as smooth as they used to. Perhaps this negative is not as major as the first two negatives. The game still feels alright and the movement is good as well as the combat, but in comparison to the innovations made in AC2 and beyond, this game feels stale and the combat/movement feels slow and jagged. If you've played AC2 and are coming back to play the original, you will be very frustrated with Altair's handling.\n5) The assassination setups are cut and dry. At the time of this game's release, the game was so much fun many of us didn't care about the repetitiveness of the information gathering part of the game. Unfortunately, especially since we've seen far better, this really hurts the game's enjoyment if you ask me. You either pickpocket a message, harass a guy, or listen in on a conversation and that's about it for the preparation missions. They're boring and frustrating.\n6) And speaking of repetitiveness, the collectibles are really, really boring. There's not really anything interesting about getting all the flags and kiling all the templars. These serve only as timesinks for the completionists.\n7) Ubisoft and UPlay, stab me plz with a blunt object.\n-----\nAll things considered, I think you should play this game. It's the first title in a legendary series of games, and was a well put-together game for its time. The story is interesting, the assassinations are fun, and the storytelling is wonderful (not to mention pretty damn good voice acting, which seems to be REALLY lacking in big titles these days).\nJust be aware that the game has not stood the test of time as well as some others, and some things will be frustrating.", "hours": 14.0, "user_id": "76561198128287463", "username": "Shiny Magikarp", "products": 155, "early_access": false}

Lets start with the good points about the game:\n1. The story - The story line in assassins creed has to be one of the best in videogame histroy as the franchise has been successful from the debut in 2007 all the way to present day. If you pay attention to the dialogue you will find a griping story that continues across the other games.\n2. The combat - The game has a very easy combat system to use with a veriaty of methods to kill your enemies, sometimes the counters are a little laggy but if your timing and reactions are good then you will have a fun time cutting down your enemies.\n3. The graphics - The graphics in comparison to newer games are awful but for a game released in 2007 the graphics are quite good and work on a veriaty of systems without any type of glitchs or lag.\nNow lets look at the bad parts of assassins creed:\n1. The sounds - In general the sounds are great quality and have no problems but there is one sound I really dont like and thats the poor women that ask for \"just a few coins\" you seem to hear it nearly everywhere in the city at somepoint and it can drive you insane!\n2. Climbing - Unlike newer assassins creed titles the climbing in this game is very slow and sluggish. sometimes altiar just stands aimlessly on a wall whilst you mash your keys trying to make him move. If you think that when enemies are chasing you that you will just climb to get away forget it! It is nearly impossible to climb away from the guards.\n3. Guards - The guards can make the game fun at times but mostly they just get in the way, for example when you are doing a stealth mission such as assassination missions the guards will make it very hard for you to complete this type of mission.\n4. Saving citizens - The game offers a little but not compulsory side quest where you save citizens from guards attacking them, this is very fun and you need to do it to achieve 100% sync in the game. The problem I have with this is that once you have killed all the guards the person you saved takes ages to finish talking (the things they say are the same for each type of character you save and irrelevent) and then after that the camera locks on to the people who will block guards for you (these people are unlocked over the city as you save more people) when you just want to climb away before more annoying guards arrive to attack you.\nOVERVIEW:\nIn general I recommend assassins creed to anyone who is looking at buying it as it has to be one of my personal favourite games and is part of one of my favourite game franchises! The Bad points list does have more points than the good points list but if you read what I had to say then you will notice that the things in the bad points list are minor little things that are no issue to most people and all the things that make a game good are found in the good points list. It took me about 18 hours in total to complete the game with 100% synch and I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time I played it.

This is the first game of the Assassin's Creed series.\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are pretty decent for the time the game was released. I played the game with everything set to highest. The landscape views (especially outside town) are a bit blurry (maybe on purpose).\nSounds:\nWell I went back to Windows XP to play this game because the NPC's didn't have sound in Windows 7. But I can imagine that the developers did not expect people to play this game in Windows 7 because Windows 7 did not exist at the time of the release of the game.\nDuring exploration of the game the music changes depending on the activities that happen. You have combat music, sounds of slicing weapons, people screaming when they discover dead bodies.\nI also liked NPC's commenting on my failed attempts to climb buildings, falling and hurting myself and such.\nGameplay:\nI'm very impressed with the gameplay. The game plays very smooth. It looks like they tackled all the bugs and it feels pretty natural to play. A controller is unfortunately not supported so I played with keyboard and mouse.\nThe most challenging for me were the battles. Best way to do battle is to defend and wait for the right timing to attack. This is also what is taught in the tutorial.\nSometimes the fights takes place in tight corners, which is more challenging than usual.\nI liked doing both the main and side quests. I really love how they took care of these quests.\nThe game made me feel like a real Assassin. I could use stealth to accomplish a lot of my missions.\nBugs:\nThe game only crashed once during my entire game experience.\nEconomy:\nI noticed a lot of beggers in the game asked for coins. I wouldn't mind giving them some coins if I had any. I did hear that the next game (Assassin's Creed II) would have coins.\nSavepoints:\nThe game saves automatically after each mission.\nHistory:\nI think this game is a good approach to mix gaming and history.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 53, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-01-03", "text": "I \"sort of\" recommend this game. There should really be a neutral buttom, because 2017, this game is a bit \"meh\".\nSee, when I first played assassin's creed, way back when it was first released, I was blown away by how beautiful the game was, and how awesome it was to be able to freerun. My entire first playthrough was just me being mesmerized by how awesome it was to be able to move more or less how you want to. But as I went to replay this game a second time, a year after my first playthrough, it was a lot less appealing. Now, many years later, I replay this game here on steam, and I can look at the game with a fresh set of eyes.\nPlaying assassin's game the first time is sort of like having a summer fling on a festival or concert when you're in your early teens. You're blown away by how good they look, and how much in common you have, and how awesome and open they are. But they're really only good for that summer fling, beause the whole infatuation is shallow and lacks content. That's what assassin's creed is to me. It still looks good after all these years... But behind the polished surface, there isn't a whole lot to be attracted yo. There's tons of bugs in spite of all time that has gone by, and the controls is clunky and unwieldy. You are still asked at time to do things which will be hard not because it's hard, but because you can't really make the controls do what you want them to. Did you enter a ladder at a weirld camera angle? Now W on your keyboard doesn't make the main character go up, but instead down. Did you run too close to a bench while being pursued by guards? Now your character will sit on it instead of keep running. Did you enter combat? Now your character will draw his sword, even if you would prefer another weapon and had a different weapon drawn.\nThese are just loose examples. Assassin's Creed is packed with these issues. Sometimes, carrying out certain missions is not a delight, but a chore, because you are aware that while you can come up with a good plan for how to perform the mission, the most likely reason you will fail it, is because of a bug. Not because of game difficulty or something similar, but because there are still issues with the game and when the game is sporting an ancient save system, it means replaying large contents of the game over and over.\nWell on to other things.\nThe main character is both believeable and unfortunatley a bit boring. As an assassin, taking lives every other day, you can imagine that someone must become hard on the inside to cope with the problems. It takes a certain type of person to do those things, and even if you're not bent on murder in particular, that sort of life will likely bend your mind to a single purpose - the cause. So Altair is not a deep person, he doesn't seem to have a background which would be interesting to explore, and he doesn't have any meaningful personal relationships either. He sort of just... Goes through life, assassinating people, because that's who he is. And that's great. It's believable to me. But it's also boring. I never felt that I got to know Altair, I don't really know who he is outside of his knife stabbing personna. And that is a bit of a shame. Ubisoft does a better job with later iterations of assassin's creed and its characters.\nThe story is forgettable. There's a story twist, but you can spot it coming long long before it's \"revealed\" to the character. There's not a whole lot of side missions beside the main story, and for being a free roam game... There's not much to roam in. I mean, the maps are huge but... There's just you, the main story and some side missions to help you succeed with the main story, and ten million billion collectibles. Alright, not that many. But still, Ubisoft sure tried to fluff replayability of the game by having a lot of flags one can collect.\nIn either case, since the game is now pretty cheap, I do recommend it. But I advise seeing it as a prequel to the story about Ezio Auditore, which is the protagonist in the next three games (assassin's creed 2, assassin's creed: brotherhood, and assassin's creed: revelations), rather than a game of its own.", "hours": 64.0, "user_id": "76561198042052395", "username": "6174", "products": 147, "early_access": false}

Its really cool to be jumping around roof tops doing parkour and killing people with awesome animation. It is also very unique and smart on how the game incorporates modern technologies into a game set in the medieval time.\nAlthough the settings are really nice, the game don't really feel immensive. Example, rooftops and buildings are repetitive so you actually stop paying attention to them and refer to the minimap to get to your location. Combat is okay as they try to design it to be realistic as possible when taking several enemies at the same time but can be slow. The NPCs are there to make the city feels alive but that is it. They are like zombies wandering around.\nMissions are repetitive. I actually reinstalled this game three times before progressing half-way or so because every mission does not have much room for exploitation for an assassin game. Even if your presence is made known before killing your target, it simply means you are going to have a tougher time getting away and each mission feels more like a puzzle than an assasination mission. Also, based on my understanding, assassination are suppose to be done discreetly and probably when there are less people as possible like night time maybe?\nAgain, side missions are simply there for the sake of existing. Meaning once the game is completed, side missions are fitted in to the game with minimal effort like collectibles, races, deliveries and etcs. The rewards are not that great to start with nor even the stories that comes with the side missions.\nWeapons and skills are unlocked progressively but it is not that great. I can't even make out the difference between a sword and wrist blade except that killing people with the blade is really stylish and cool.\nCities are huge but you need to make several travels between them as the areas are unlocked progressively so yeah visiting the same place over and over again is kind of boring too.\nStory is quite interesting however do note that the game is not historical accurate. Some references and event timeline may be correct but that is all. I think the progress of the story is alright considering the time it is set in but it is too draggy for me. Not much plot but if they can change the pace of the story and put in more plots it could be really interesting.\nI think Assassin's Creed is an alright game if sword fights, stealth/puzzle, parkour, conspiracy and assassination in the medieval time is your thing, but don't expect something really hardcore here.", "hours": 11.9, "username": "indecendence", "products": 2311, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 55, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-12-28", "text": "AC Review:\nWow! It took me a long time to finally get into the AC franchise, but I'm very pleased that I did.\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\nGameplay & Controls 5/10: Definitely the most challenging aspect of this game, many times to the point of being tedious and irritating because you end up repeating some tasks multiple times before succeeding. (Another reviewer mentioned something about yelling and/or pounding on the table because of frustration with the controls. That may have happened more than once with me as well...) This was partly due to the fact that I was playing this on a PC and the controls really don't translate well from console to PC. It was exceedingly difficult to coordinate some of the movements, especially during combat scenarios and when you were sprinting. To say that I sprinted into walls a few times while trying to turn sharp corners would be an understatement. This was the only factor, in my opinion, that made the game unpleasant to play. If I tried it with an XBox 360 controller or something similar installed, it might have made a big difference.\nGraphics 9/10:  Holy mackerel! For the year in which this game was released, I was totally blown away by the quality of the graphics. Given that it was released only two years after Elder Scrolls Oblivion, I was expecting graphics only slightly better than that game, but not even Skyrim -- which came out four years after AC -- is this realistic or amazing (and I happen to really love Skyrim, so that's saying something). Huge positive factor for this game, as it really makes you feel immersed in the world. *Side note: For the horse-lovers out there (like me) you're going to want to spend as much time in one section of the game as possible because you get to ride some of the most realistic in-game horses I've ever seen. Did I mention Skyrim? Yeah. It doesn't hold a candle to AC in terms of the horses.\nStoryline 7/10:  While the story within the game is fascinating and entertaining, it's also not terribly accurate in some ways. If you're not at all concerned with that sort of thing, then this rating means nothing, but for those of us who appreciate history, it can be frustrating to see otherwise excellent games not get something right or deliberately alter important events just to suit the story. And honestly, the Templars are a rather misunderstood group, and it was dismaying to see them so badly maligned in this game. They really don't deserve it. *Side note: Christians, be aware that this game holds morality to be a thing relative to the person. (Of course, if you're okay with playing a game like this in the first place, then this aspect of the game shouldn't really surprise or bother you.) There are characters who deliberately state that certain things we hold sacred and true are nothing more than illusions or lies. Just be prepared for that when you play and remember that you *don't* have to buy into everything the game says in order to enjoy it. It's just a form of dynamic storytelling.\nOverall Rating 7/10:  I found this game to be tremendously enjoyable to play, especially once I started to get the hang of the otherwise frustrating controls. Said controls remained difficult enough that they distracted a bit from the game, but the amazing graphics and engrossing in-game story balanced it out so much that I would play it again in a heartbeat and am looking forward to continuing in the franchise.\n(Oh, and the only other complaint I have -- a minor one at that -- is the fact that you have to travel through about five or six different game screens before you can exit.

Each zone: 8 citizens to save, 8 viewpoints to see, 6 side missions to unlock information: 1 pickpocket, 1 eavesdropping, 1 beatup, 1 assassinations, 1 flags collection, 1 roof parkout. You must do 2-3 side missions to unlock boss fight. After 3rd boss this is getting into a repetitive chore. Although there is increase in guards/npcs, it is still repetitive.\nOverall the game is nice, minimum bugs, good game play, still good time sink.\nBig thumbs up for no Uplay stuff yet, good things of an old title.\nDo recommend.", "hours": 20.6, "username": "Rossos", "products": 1294, "early_access": false}

More importantly, the thrill of succesfully completing a big mission that you've been preparing through several \"side quests\" is something that never changes.\nThe main criticism of this game has always been that it can get slightly repetitive after a while. Personally, I've completed it at least 3-4 times, so that's what I think about that. :D\nSeriously, while I can see where that comes from, the game keeps showing you new things, including an amazing series of around a dozen great side characters that you get to meet (and mostly assassinate) and that plus the (not one!) two main stories that you slowly piece together as you progress should keep you stuck to the game until the dramatic end when it all converges.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 67, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-10-13", "text": "Assassin's Creed in one word; repetitive.\nTo begin, there was a fair bit I did enjoy about the game including: the parkour movement system, the story, and the ability to improve with the future games. The parkour movement system was what really made the gameplay enjoyable for me personally. It was new and fresh at the time, and was a grandfather to some of the newer generations of parkour movement systems in and out of the Assassin's Creed series. The story kept me hooked through out the series and is important for this game in particular and for future games. Even if you don't think you'd enjoy this game or don't want to play it, I would definitely recommend watching a play through or reading a summary of the plot for story purposes. Lastly, I liked how this game left room for improvement. This game did have a fair bit I personally didn't enjoy or thought that could be better, and with future games we see the improvements come and the games becoming more fine tuned.\nWith every game there are always pros and there are always cons. This game had a few key cons, the biggest of which I think were: the repetitiveness, lack of stealth, and hand to hand combat. This game is infamous for it's reptitive side missions, all in which are exact clones of one another with just the information changing through out the length of the game. This makes the game harder to play and stick with when you do the exact missions over and over and lose interest in them. Another thing I didn't like about this game is it's MAJOR lack of stealth. For a game titled; \"Assassin's Creed\" the first thing that comes to my mind is assassin, which then leads to stealth for me. This game however, has no easy or obvious stealth. There are some points in which you are required to be \"stealthy\" and shadow informants. There is also the fact that you can stealth assassinate the main targets, but that is never easy or as satisfying as it should be. For a game that screams it should be stealth, it really doesn't have a stealth aspect. I see this game more of a action game then a stealth game. The hand to hand combat is also a big let down for me as well. It wouldn't be if I didn't play a role as big as it does in this game. With some of the side missions you are required to \"Rough Up\" some informants for some information, in which you have to beat them down with your fists. With a game mechanic as big as this, you would think they would have it polished as best as possible. However, they left out one of the biggest things possible; counter attacks. With any weapon you use, when you're in battle you can counter attack, making it extremely useful. With hand to hand combat however, you can not. Making the combat a back and forth fight and also making it stale to play. Another notable thing I would mention when telling about this game to a friend is how the collectables in this game have no meaning. Especially in the steam addition as there are no achievements for them.\nSo, all in all. Would I ever recommend it to a friend? Yes. If you can look past the repetitive side missions, there is still fun to be had with this game and good story to gather from it as well. I would not recommend more then one play through or would not see people playing this game more then once back to back, but I do think people who want to get into this game should definitely check it out. Whether you want to get into this game or just find a game with a parkour movement system, this is a fun game that can give you a play through out of it. I do however warn that if you're looking for a stealth game, DO NOT buy this game. This game is far from that.", "hours": 24.6, "username": "Cy83RN1Nj4", "products": 111, "early_access": false}

Gameplay is repetitive with only 3 main cities (Damascus, Acre, Jerusalem) and your home base (Masyaf), but the story's what drives the experience.\nThe gameplay itself can be (very) glitchy at moments, especially when free running; your weapon arsenal isn't as extensive as the other games, but it does the job wonderfully; there're no negative drawbacks to not being stealthy, so be as crazy as you want. These things don't detract from the enjoyment of the game, but can be frustrating when you have to escape after assassinating your target. This is a series in its infancy, we all know where it goes from here with the numerous added enhancements and features.\nGraphics-wise it's held up quite well; the environments still look gorgeous and the attention to detail for both the cities and history still fascinates me to this day. The audio, on the other hand, is alright for the main characters and targets, but is recycled for the NPC townsfolk and you can hear the compression in some of the dialog. This is a port, so it's understandable.\nDespite the minor glitches and audio complaints, I still highly recommend this game to veterans of the series and those who have never played the series before.

While Assassins strive to preserve freedom - Templars seek to control people. Desmond who lives in modern times is put by Templars into Animus with which he can access genetic memories of his ancestors and re-lives the events happening in the third crusade times.\nThe game is very atmospheric. The cities you visit during the game are big and extremely atmospheric. It really does feel like a crusader movie. The movement - ability to climb any building, run on the rooftops is very well done. The whole scope of the game does look impress. For the times this was released it is very impressive. Even today it still looks very good and holds its own.\nDuring the game you will kill a number of templars. And while all the tools seem to be present the game feels a bit repetitive. Each mission follows pretty much the same schematic - follow someone and eavesdrop on conversation to learn something, beat someone up, pickpocket someone else. In the end it does not affect the main mission much though. With additional Ubisoft dis tractors - climbing towers to reveal map and so on it's a completionist nightmare. Even more so that the side missions are even more repetitive than the core plot. The main missions at least vary from each other and are really fun to do.\nThe strength of this game lies within stealth. Blending with the crowd, picking routes to avoid detection to deal the final blow. When executed properly it's really satisfying. The combat is a bit too easy. All you have to do is wait for a queue to counter and you can fight off a hundred men.\nThe only problem I had was with an XBox controller which for some reason does not work well with the PC version of the game. And some keys are bound in a strange way without ability to re-bind them. Even using community fixes I couldn't get it to work exactly as it should.\nThe whole story of Desmond Miles is a bit weak - and personally I would prefer for it to be strictly about Altair.\nOverall the game still holds up - worth picking up and playing through.", "hours": 19.3, "user_id": "76561197997045080", "username": "agurczuk", "products": 921, "early_access": false}

I was playing it continuously in the evenings for 1-2h/day max and I never got  bored.

Everything is downgraded as usual. However, this is not the biggest of surprises in the game industry these days, so in my generosity, it can be forgiven.\nWhat I and many others fail to understand is the concept of the game, for it simply isnt very well thought out before put into use. This is very obvious when you really start to understand the gameplay and try to execute the things you observe the game showing you, which eventually feels clunky, outdated and sometimes, unfortunately, even flat-out depressing.\nGameplay-wise, the game holds your hand almost all the time and it becomes really annoying, when you start to notice you have no real difference in the course of action. There are moments where you just feel completely lost and get annoyed at how everything doesnt quite fit together.\nThe controls dont feel fluid at all, and occasionally you feel like you're either stuck in the mud or glue, or the game intentionally was made hard and frustrating to control. Why would anyone want to offer the players of their game an experience like this?\nAnd what's really frustrating are the sounds. It's like someone literally wanted to hire one of the worst composers, voice actors and the sound designers for this kind of a game! Could it be simply a bad decision from the lead of this project or very, very dark humor from the entire team of the game developers? You decide!\nAnd dont even get me started on the AI. It's rather non-existent. Some games are famous for their silly bot-AI that keeps doing mistakes and failing at the only thing it was designed to do. The only difference between those games and this is that the AI here isn't even funny. It just wants to make you shout at it's actions in utter rage.\nThe performance of the game tends to be lackluster. Ive seen it perform badly on many different specs and machines, which cannot garner much respect, but at this point it doesn't really surprise, either.\nAll this could be fixed with at least a long, interesting story that would give content for your money and/or time, but it doesn't really offer either.\nWhen you thought it couldn't get any worse, the game has more bugs here and there, hindering your already non-existent progressing and sucking the last drops of joy out of the experience\nOn top of all of this, the game is insanely difficult to progress in.

If this is likely to be a huge issue for you, perhaps skip ahead to ACII instead, which has (almost) all the great elements of this game but with much more varied missions. AC has no game-breaking bugs for me, but minor bugs include bodies occasionally flipping through the air.\nNow for the reasons to play:\u00a0\nThe voice acting varies in quality, but it is generally high (with the notable exception of Altair, unfortunately).\nSome people dislike the way you can fall of ledges when jumping to them: while this can be an issue in the early part of the game, once you relearn how to grab onto ledges it becomes simply an additional skill the game requires, making free running a little more challenging if you want to avoid falling to the ground.\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game as highly enjoyable stealth action game with a great story.", "hours": 18.3, "username": "Sepia_Knight", "products": 405, "early_access": false}

You start off as an ordinary bartender who is kidnapped and utilized for his ancestors' heritage. Through this process you are placed in a machine properly named the 'Animus', through which your ancestors' memories are viewed. In this game you see through the eyes of master assassin Altair, and the trials his must face to regain his master rank within the brotherhood. You travel to three familiar locations we have all heard about in history class, Acre, Damascus, and Jerusalem. Here you fulfill tasks and assassinations to progress the story. Spend your time wisely because there are plenty of viewpoints, citizen saving, and challenge missions to complete in each location, as well as uneventful flags to find. By collecting flags, you unlock additional memories of Altair.\nPros:\n- Combat is easy to master.\n- Parkour responds well to your path.\n- The landscapes are beautiful for an 2008 game engine.\n- The story is engaging to follow and fully voiced.\n- Weapon upgrades are easy to obtain, you just continue through the story to obtain the next piece.\n- Controls respond extremely well, recommend using a controller.\n- The game is short if you just focus on main tasks. I don't recommend, however, if you're just in it to learn the story you could spend maybe an entire weekend to complete the main story.\nCons:\n- It is dated so some players may dislike the old graphics compared to games of today.\n- Side-quests are heavily repeated and bland.\n- Bugs, especially when anyone hits the floor the game tosses bodies all over the place. Sometimes even you go flying somewhere and glitch out. Though it is also hillarious!\n- The transition between Desmond and Altair can get sort of annoying, especially when you want to progress during the story's juicy parts.\n- Flag collection. Very tedious and not so rewarding.\n- Uplay. I only dislike this for achievement purposes, and having another game software running just to play this game.\nTo wrap it up, these are my opinions of the game. I enjoyed Assassin's Creed and I am planning to play through all of them the rest of the summer. The stories appear to get way better and I for sure would like to play through them all. The start of the series is short, but it educates the player well enough to understand what is conspiring between Assassins and Templars.

There are plenty of opportunities to save helpless obese guys and screaming young Arabic girls. This game is very realistic, in which if you do anything socially unacceptable, such as stabbing people, the guards will take notice and chase you. In this case, you must break the line of sight by either climbing to the roof of a building or hiding behind your intimidating vigilante friends.

If you are the type of person who would rather run in screaming, and wildly slash your way through the sword-wielding guards, then I would recommend some other game. Although, hacking guards is a large part of this stealth game. One of the largest building blocks in this game, (and every other AC for that matter) is parkour.

So if you have played more recent ACs and want to check out the very first one, be prepared for some major differences.\nHowever, the game still looks nice... it's colorful, the animations still look cool and it's still fun to run around in Damasc, Accra and Jerusalem.\nSome differences though:\n- The parcouring/freerunning works quite well, but it's pretty...clunky compared to that in, say, Unity or Syndicate. So accidents will happen, you will experience some misjumps and will prolly fall a couple of times. Still, it can be quite fun.\n- The combat system is a bit spammy. Mostly, you hit x to strike and, while holding the block-button (shoulder button on a controller), hit x as well to block and counter-strike.\nAt first, combat is rough, but with each sequence, you learn more abilities (or get them back), so you can fight more efficiently, and a counter-strike will often result in one-shotting a mob.\n- You have your sword, throwing knifes (which you can fight with), your fists and the hidden blade (which you can't fight with really, it's only used for stabbing people who are unaware), that's it... no smoke bombs, rope darts, guns, bows, xbows etc. It's limited, but that does not bother me much.\n- The cinematics/conversations are rather long, and can not be skipped. However, if you play this for the very first time, that's ok, as it's interesting to listen and learn about the story and background.\n- There are some bugs and glitches... occasionally, you'll die when you hit a haystack, which of course is a bug.\n- The sequences are a bit repetitive... climb towers to find activities, do those to gather information on your target, report to your fellow assassin at the bureau, then head for the assassination of the target. It's like that until the end of the game.\n- There is some side activity, but not as much as in recent games. No money, no purchasing of gear upgrades etc.\nThe game is showing it's age, and of course, AC II later hit the ball out of the park, BUT:\nI still think that, if you like the franchise, you should play this first one at least once to see the start of the series. It's not all that long, and I think it's still a fun game with a lot of atmosphere and a wonderful soundtrack by Jesper Kyd.\nAnd to be frank, I enjoyed replaying this much more than the most recent, IMO horrible Syndicate, and even the very spammy combat in AC I is better than the one in that new game.\nSo... check it out. It's old, has quite a few flaws and is missing a lot of the things more modern ACs had, but it's a great start to the series. I REALLY REALLY recommend to use a controller though! I played all of them with a controller, but especially for this one, I don't think you'll get much out of it if you try to play it with kbm.\n7.5/10", "hours": 4.1, "user_id": "76561198171238315", "username": "danstew23", "products": 185, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

In terms of story it has a great setup leading into the next game dealing with Ezio. Altiar's story was a little short but his was not meant to be but a window. His story plays a greater part latr in the series but I'm getting ahead of myself. Remembering the controls was easy, though it seems easier on a controler (properly  bound) However the controler made the camera slow to utalize, unless I over looked a sensitivity option somewhere. The game had a lot of glitches in it from jumping against a ledge that you would normally catch only to miss follwed by NPC's glitching in their movements durring and after a chase. not to mention the occasional crash.

Luckily that .exe is offered.  And you cannot launch it from steam without renaming the DirectX9 version to the one that Steam wants to load.  I do not feel the developers should be held responsible for updating their games until the end of time, but Steam should at least display a warning.\nAltair's voice is some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard to date in all the games I've ever played.  It's painful to listen to.  Most other voices are just ok.  I turn music off so no comment there.  The beggars, guards, and other people are numerous but their voices aren't numerous enough, so you'll hear the same recordings over and over again, though each map has different voices for the same types of people.\nThe controls are a little awkward, and i'm not referring to the difficulty matching up each action to a button.  It actually plays pretty well once you understand the High Profile mode which some people have difficulty adjusting to.  The awkwardness is with the camera angles.  They get stuck a lot in tight places, where you will often find yourself in, and it causes you to stab innocent people or jump off a ledge when you don't intend to.\nI was hoping the fluidness and abilities would match that of the batman series, but it doesn't at all.  You can't aim the angle in which to throw a person off a ledge, forcing you to line your character up correctly, which may not be possible the way the guards move or other objects that may be in the way.  You can't pounce from a ledge to kill despite the opening sequence alluding that you can.  (You also cannot hide amidst the schollars while being watched as alluded to in the opening sequence as well.)  Hiding only works when you're not watched, which I feel is more real anyway.  You can't extend your hidden blade while swordfighting.  The knife throw and knife slash is the same button, so if they dodge your attack and land too far away, you'll reduce your inventory of throwing knives if you keep smashing the button.  You can pickpocket for more though.  Your character is a bit limited in what it can do.\nDespite its age, the game holds up pretty well.  the pixellation is apparent in the scenes but the models are full and detailed.  the maps are maze-like and feel like a corridor may or may not be present while running around, and if you run down a dark alley, you may have a 50/50 chance you'll hit a wall and have to fight the people you're facing.  there is plenty of z-axis also.  You'll feel like the maps are quite full.  There is duplication of architecture but it isn't noticeable that much.  the horse riding is also pretty cool and you can fight while riding, though its a little hard to hit anything.  They can knock you off your horse.\nthe guard's senses are better than the Hitman games.  Hitman's character's ability to detect you is good, but this game feels more real.  You can fist fight in front of guards without them caring, so you can get away from the drunks.\nI got it on sale and its about a fair price then.  Buy it to partake in the storyline or learn the controls and it will help you later in the series.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 76, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-07-03", "text": "A Flawed Dose of Nostalgia\nIn 2016, it seemed like to play the original 2007 Assassin's Creed was to revert to the rough draft of the AC formula, but that is where I found myself loving the core gameplay of AC. The first game in the franchise hadn't yet been bogged down with the extra bloat most evident in the later titles like AC Unity, from the challenges and side missions to the rendering of visuals. The seminal Assassin's Creed succeeds today in 2016 because it benefits from being the innovative first in a formulated franchise.\nThe balance between a solid storyline and mindless side activities kept me moving towards finishing the game without feeling like the completionist challenge was unsurmountable (a personal problem I find with modern open-world games). I typically started with viewpoints, moved to \"Save Citizens\" missions, and then began my formal investigation into my assassination target. In my mind, I was learning the city, its people, and then solving the overall problem plaguing them. The objectives could be completed in any manner, but the approach I took felt the most natural for a stranger entering a city.\nThe combat felt great when my timing synced up well,  It felt good to be that overpowered, yet it was too easy and didn't involve much strategy despite being trained in-game with various techniques. Occasionally, I would find myself on-top of various things like market stalls with six other men on the same stall with three other men attempting to climb up to the \"battlefield\" . The AI scripting felt like the enemies were simply and mindlessly piling on. All I had to do was time the counter attack successfully to take out any force.\nThe stealth felt unrefined and was frequently undermined by a stray AI stepping into the shared environment or a drunken NPC shoving me into a group while I was attempting to blend in. While it helped to utilize stealth from time to time, the behaviors which broke my stealth usually threw me into another fifteen man battle. It was most useful when traversing the map to avoid battle engagement, but detrimental to all the investigations crafted into the story when a major assassination would down spiral due to imprecise stealth mechanics. This is best illustrated when I attempted to throw a knife at my target and pressed the lock-on button. It alerted everyone in the arena to my presence with the simple lock-on and a twenty man battle ensued.\nAfter bouncing around to various AC games in the past year or so, the GUI in this original game felt so in touch with the premise of the Animus technology. The HUD and in-game menu never appeared gaudy or clunky, but the main menu unnecessarily required me to briefly switch to my mouse to make a character profile selection before I could begin playing with my gamepad. The map was a delight to engage with, but the investigations give the player various map information such as where guards are during the assassination's preceding event and the safest path for extraction after killing the target, that was ultimately undermined by an under-detailed HUD map.\nI played the original version of Assassin's Creed to completion on PS3 around 2009 and it left a nostalgic feeling in the back of my mind. The nostalgic thirst was quenched with this latest 2016 playthrough on PC, but not without some stumbles along the way that reminded me that some serious gameplay mechanic overhaul occurred in the past 7 years.

You have to hold three damn keys just to sprint. Climbing things isn't too fun either, because the guy is really slow doing it and often he can't reach to climb and it takes you a second to realize that, because of his slowness. When you run to an edge of something, you just \"stare\" down instead of jumping or doing anything sensible. You have to press \"other hand\" control.\nThe reason for the mess with the controls is 'cause you have \"low profile\" and \"high profile\" modes. The low-profile mode is annoying as hell, however, because you move around like a snail. Same goes for some places like the Abstergo lab or some buildings: you can't sprint, you can only \"walk\" which takes forever.\nSpeaking of profiles, you have to actually use a horse to move around cities. I searched around whether there's a fast travel mode, and apparently there is, but not in all the places and you have to get to the edge of the map or something. Annoying. This means if you want to move at any appreciable speed, you have to \"gallop\" in high profile mode which, for some reason, makes every random dude with a sword want to kill you.\nNow, you may think me being on a horse and the dudes being on foot... I can just run away! What's the problem then? Well, the problem is one of the more annoying features of the game: the detection meter. Whoever thought it was an awesome idea for it to loudly beep should be fired. So, it beeps if you're in an area where you might get attacked. If you get detected, it starts to beep even louder. And if you run away? Hell, that thing will beep forever! You actually have to find a bush somewhere and jump into the bush and sit there for a minute just to shut that stupid beeper off\u2014no other reason; there's no one chasing you any more!\nSo for the last three hours, I feel like I've done nothing but wrestle with controls and get annoyed with the damned beeper.\nAs for the story, well, it may be a good one, but I already dislike the guy I'm playing as.

A game which started off as a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia series quickly grew into massive IP of its own. Although it's the first in the AC franchise Assassin's Creed is far from a great game. It has its pros that grew to define the franchise for what it is and also several cons that needs to be address. The game is set in the year 1191 during the height of the Third Crusade between the Muslims and Christians. The game covers several Middle Eastern locations which are rarely seen in gaming such as Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. It's great to see Ubisoft tackle this sort of environment in a more historical setting than what modern Middle Eastern looks like. The environment feels immersive in its on way with Crusade guards along corner, horse riding in the frontier and also sword fighting. You play as Altair, an arrogant master assassin in the Assassin Brotherhood who has lost his title due to his own pride. Throughout the course of the game you're tasked with eliminating nine Templars while questioning the motives behind the assassination an your Brotherhood itself. The story is rather forgettable because it basically involves you moving from one city to another assassinating on Templar member to another which felt repititive. The only redeeming factor is probably the plot twist at the end.\nThe gameplay of Assassin's Creed is more of an action adventure game with added stealth mechanic. You can hide with scholars, on benches with citizens and also in hiding spots like stacks of hay. Movement in this game is rather annoying as Altair's running feels more like robot than an agile assassin with a poor camera control on top of it. Climbing also suffers from the same problem with some aspect of the building looks climbable but actually isn't. The combat of the game also doesn't par that well. Although it is still requires more skills than in future installments. You can't just swing your sword to easily kill all of the enemies as some enemies can actually counter and block. There's also no button prompts for counter so timing your counter is crucial. The stealth section of this game is kind of useless because sometimes guard can even detect you even if you're behind a wall. Even with all the research and eavesdropping about your current target, assassinating them stealthily is still a challenge bacause of the bad AI.\nWith all that being said, Assassin's Creed is still a worthwhile game especially for die hard fan of the series. Even though it has its flaws here and there it is still pretty enjoyable being able to run across rooftops and escape from guards and also fighting hordes of enemies at a time. For a of a franchise the game is okay as it leaves a lot of room of improvement and I would gladly give it a score of 6/10.", "hours": 16.8, "user_id": "76561198174710207", "username": "Kazurr", "products": 90, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

The good things about it is that it's a great addition for a die hard AC fan. You get to play as Altier and know his backstory before the other ancestors in the franchise.When this game was released, the environment was quite rich in innovative and the NPCs acted and reacted to your character realistically. For it\u2019s time, it was quite an achievement. However, the later games definitely are better than this one.\nI will list the cons.\n- Repetitive\n- Always have to select the Xbox controller setting every time you start the game.\n- Crashing\n- You have to use a mod to have your Xbox controller configured correctly.\n- There is no in game reward for collecting flags and killing templars except for bragging rights.\nI would definitely recommend playing this game after playing the later AC games just to see the back story and how the whole franchise started. The storyline is actually very good with twists and turns. However, if you aren't a big AC fan then you can go ahead and skip this one.", "hours": 41.2, "username": "Claritiel", "products": 491, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 82, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-04-26", "text": "is an excellent Historic-Science Fiction Action/Adventure Game mainly inspired by the novel Alamut written by Vladimir Bartol way back in 1938. The Game introduced many brilliant concepts and a totally different mindblowing plot which is very well connected from past to the present and you can devise many theories based on it. It was turned down by many people because it lacked variety and yes it did. I'm gonna list out the positive points between this game and its successors and also the reason why I think it's still an awesome game of the franchise. It had a special charm that none of it's successors had and will ever have.\nThe Game is simple and doesn't involve customisation or anything and doesn't feature money,etc to buy stuff and stays true in assassinating your targets. Whereas the other games got deviated into buying stuff and oh god the renovation business started.\nHad some great concepts such as synchronisation for example, its not actually health but how close you (Desmond) could faithfully recreate the actions of ancestor, like if you carelessly fell off from a building or punched some civvy, etc. you lose the synchronisation, because the ancestor didn't do such thing in his life and was careful. It will regain over time and become stable when it is lost.\nWhere as in other games you have health and armor and the way to replenish it is to drink some health tonic. Death in all these games is actually just a bad sync-up where you replayed the ancestor's memory event so bad that you lost touch with the original one's completely, so the Animus reinitialises back to the point where it made sense before you screwed it up entirely.\nSo basically Ezio, etc. actually dies when you run out of it. Checkpoint restart is just a game mechanic. You can say that the Animus is still re-initialising the scene, but you died from lack of health, not loss of synchronization, So the Synchronisation no longer makes sense, so technically it was very well implemented and made some real actual sense in this game. And there are some other concepts which were not only solid and made sense but also gave a definite depth to the game.\nIt has darker and gritty atmosphere with well suited background scores as you scour for information about the target in various ways which gives you this 'Assassin' feeling. While the other games had peaceful and relaxing score not stating that they're bad but this one had better and showed how dark and unsafe the world is and was perfect for its Middle-Eastern setting.\nThe Chase Theme (Access the Animus as per OST) of this game is just goddamn EPIC.\n\"You are not a bloodthirsty berserker, nor an invincible warrior cutting through waves of guards - you are a blade in a crowd, someone, who doesn't exist...until the blade has pierced your targets throat. As the bells echo throughout the city and the guards draw their swords against you, you realize it is time to run...run and become no one once more.\nThe one thing that the original Assassin's Creed did better than ALL other sequels (everything up to Syndicate) is making you realize when it's time to run.\ufeff\"\nSource:\n(Check the comment section)\nThe dialogues are surprisingly deep and interesting, only downside to it was it didn't feature any subtitles and sometimes cannot make out what they are saying because they sometime speak foreign language and won't speak simple english at all.\nUnlike other games where you scale a building like spidey, it is slow paced and that is great because it is realistic, but oh well people are just too impatient.\nEvery assassin in the order abide by the three tenets of the creed as in the game's title. In other games there is no mentioning of the creed and completely lost the meaning of the game's title itself and became a milking title instead.\nPlot wise, the game is very short without considering the repetition but its really well made and it is just the beginning of the story as it throws you at a cliffhanger at the end. The Visuals are pretty neat too. It was so demanding back then in its time of release and even after all these years, it still really looks good.", "hours": 28.3, "username": "Sunny Senpai", "products": 1145, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

The story is pretty decent, along with graphics but the real standout is the mechanics. Climbing buildings and running along rooftops is a highly satisfying experience, especially in an open world, it sometimes doesnt work the way you want or expect it to but when it does its highly entertaining.\nAs I mentioned the game is flawed. REPETITIVE, my biggest gripe with the game is the damn repetitiveness. You do the same thing every time in the same format and it can be extremely boring.

Same goes for AC2 (See note 2 Below)\n-No AC games have difficulty settings (see note 1 below)\n-Unskippable cutscenes you must watch every time to re-enter the open world after beating game\n---------------------------\nNote 1: I'd first like to say being the AC lore-fanboy I am, the game being a \"recollection\" of past events a difficulty-setting wouldn't be very lore-friendly.  But fear not! You can still make the game much more difficult for yourself messing with the HUD.  Yes, that's right, the HUD.  One of the great things is that all elements of the HUD, (Health, Minimap, Counter-Indicator, etc) can all be toggled individually so you may tailor the challenge to your liking.  Want to disable the minimap and keep the map closed and have to actully climb buildings to get note of your surroundings? You can do that.  Want to not have an indicator saying when you are in eyesight of a guard and have to look for one yourself? You can do that.  You get the point.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nNote 2: If you decide to use a controller for this game, you will need\nSimply unpack it with winrar or 7zip, then drag the two files into Steams AC1 folder, and your good to go! It says it is for wireless controllers, but it fixes it for just about any xbox 360 controllers.  The same files also fix AC2 just the same.  However, Brotherhood and on work fine on their own.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION:\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall the game deserves a re-mastery in my opinion, Altair needs more love (Even if he is an arrogant prick in the beginning).  If all you care about is the story, I would reccommend you read the book instead.

The most realistic animations possible. Running, climbing walls, horse riding, fighting, jumping, it all looks amazingly good. The game is primarily taking place in middle east during the 12 century and the environment looks vey beautiful and has very nice graphics with nice screen effects such as when you take damage, when you fast travel e.t.c. Its a detailed game with high quality in graphics and gameplay. The fighting in the game is unique and is the most successful part of this game. The specific time click with the mouse makes it very fun and rewarding. Click at the right moment and see the awesome animations when you slay your enemy to the ground. You feel so very cool and powerful in the game when everybody has respect of you, they are begging for their life and are screaming in fear and pain when you slay the enemies. They will flee from you and the people around you will be screaming in panic. Its as awesome as it can be. The enemies are cocky and will mock you and its so great to show them who the real boss is. Highly addictive and fun. It works so well with the automatic climbing and running system in the game so its fun just to run around. The story is very good and smart. You are already a master assassin but you have been downgraded to the lowest rank in your \"clan\",so you have to start over from the basics. And its in the basics we want to start right? And by the time you do good things for the clan you'll get more and more of your gears back and you get to use your assassin skills again. (Its way better compared to assassins creed 2 when you are a complete noob that becomes a super assassin by touching his fathers clothes. So, utterly dumb.) The main \"quests\", or goals in the game is basically assassinations of important people. But to do that you need to gather information about them, so you do some different things to get this information. You beat people up, spy on people, pick peoples pockets, and more. Its mostly all of the same but the open environment makes the game far from linear. Every time you play the game again you can always try different tactics in different ways. The sound is perfect. The sword battles and crushing bones and slashing makes the combat more powerful. All the people around you are talking about what you're doing, they notice if you are climbing, hitting in to people, if you are drawing your weapon, leaving dead bodies behind e.t.c. Its a realistic feeling and you feel that whatever you do in the game matters. The voice acting is good. I do'nt remember the music so i cant tell. (I turn of the music when i play a game for a more realistic feeling but that's just me).\nTo conclusion. This game is one of the best games i have played.

It's not that bad a game, it's just boring a lot of the time. Its very mediocre in many ways, placing itself in-between in most ways. The fights, for example, are a bit like hack and slash and most can be won just by hitting the same button again and again. Yet, you will still need to think a bit over how to approach the figth to win them when there are for example several enemies, just not enough to make it a tactical or skill-needing figthing game. So it's neither real hack and slash, nor gives you the freedom to make advanced moves, it's just a bit anoying in-between. In the same way, an assassination game should have some element of sneak, acrobatic skill or tactic approach, but most of the time, you will find it boring to slowly walk through until finaly you just ram through and find out that you could just have done that from the beginning, again it places itself in an annoying in-between. While you carry out a lot acrobatic stunts, \"you\" don't really do anything. Unlike older platforms games, the game does most of the things for you. Unlike an old platform classic like Super Mario 64 or Tomb Raider, you don't need to practice your skills and calculate how far to jump, find out just how much to pull the controller to get over the small bridge without falling down or anything like that. The game will make sure you don't fall down and almost always make the jump, and even if you don't, it doesn't really matter. Assassins Creed is a good example of how much many modern games hold your hand, leaving out all the fun of having to focus and using all your skills to win.

Even considering some missteps, concerning the latest direction the games have taken, I will still look at AC games through rose-coloured glasses. Except the first game of the franchise, that is.\nIt is the game that introduces us to the overarching plot of Templars versus Assassins. This is all very interesting and Desmond seems kind of cool. The way of how this story is told is also innovative and cool. Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, however, who is the 'real' protagonist of the game, is bland to say the least. The way he is written, does not allow the player to easily identify with him and thus makes him a bit annoying.\nGameplay-wise the game suffers from some very annoying problems as well. The jumping and climbing, which has become a trademark for the AC franchise, is not that polished in the first game. Very often jumps do not work out as planned and the stealth can sometimes be hindered by exactly those quirks. Furthermore, the missions are extremely repetetive and the travel-system in this game is god-awful.\nFor anyone, who wants to get into the AC series: Do yourself a favour and skip this one. There are tons of videos that give you a summary of the story, so that you can get into the second game, without having missed anything from Desmond's story.

When it was released, though, the hyped expectations of the whole gaming world were... turned down, sadly.\nWhile without a doubt that was a high-class, AAA product, with prodigious depth of open-world gaming experience, fascinating visuals, thoroughly reconstructed medieval cities and intriguing story. Yet all that was not enough. The creators of Assassin's Creed made almost everything right... but lose the fun-out-of-the-gameplay somewhere on producing stages.\nI remember playing the game right after release, and I was grown tired of it in second city, no matter how much I was stunned by the prologue and the first city. Inglorious Re-Peeat-Ability is the thing that killed the hype of the game and downgraded its undoubted merits. The most usual Ubisoft story, as it seems.\nBut, as we look now, after the dust is settled, the first Assassin game was not bad. Quite contrary, it is still pleases us with visual feast. The reconstruction of medieval world is one of the best in known fiction worlds, would that be games, books or films. The fighting theme is ten times bested by the Shadow of Mordor title... but it is still engaging. Stealth is no match in terms of cunning and diversity with games like Hitman... But you know that too, you get used to it so long ago!\nSo, that that's I'm gonna tell you: if you've missed that game so far, try it now, it is definetely worth a shot. Just... don't play it like an open-world game. I can't believe I write something like that, being a huge fan on open-world gameplay, but in case of AC1 that's the point. There are just not enough rewards for the whole additional activity Ubisoft added in the game. No point in opening chests, collecting flags, and so on. That's that killed my fun when I was making my first approach there.\nJust play the scenario missions and kill occasional tampliers on your way, while exploring and sightseeing the great cities which was putted into that game. As I said already, there are no other thing, which will give you so complex experience of life in the medieval Mid-East. Just for that Assassin's Creed 1 deserves a place in your games collection, aside from a fact it was a father for superb Assassin's Creed 2, which stands proudly as one of the best games ever created.\nMy mark 7.5.

But I have to stress the fact that it has so many flaws like the other games in the franchise do (especially in the case of unity *cough*), but all it really is, is a repetetive game that makes you run everywhere and doing the same kind of short missions over and over. The small tasks you have to do just to get some information to progress the story (which you have to do over and over 9 times during the game's main storyline mind you), is so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing lame. At least in the other ones there is more flexibility in terms of how you progress, and this adds a lot of variety to the overall gameplay. In this game however, you run around to the exact same places more than once, and the environments are boring and bland because the citizens have little to no emotion whatsoever other than running everywhere and screaming like chimpanzes high on meth with a splash of beer while driving a lambourgini backwards in a forest. When they see you running around they usually give you the same remarks again and again, like \"Oh stop your going to hurt someone!\", or there might be beggars who like to say \"Give me your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing money.\" which you don't have whatsoever. I mean why the hell would you go into a damn city populated by at least 100.000 npcs there, and not have some medicine or something. What about food? What about throwing knives? Why the hell do you have to get throwing knives from everyday thugs that are so damn indistinguishable from regular citizens? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, why is this game so god damn bland!?\nIn short, I found this game to be incredibly boring, bland, stale, buggy, repetetive, and a whole lot of other\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I like the parts of the story-line where you control Desmond better than the rest of this game, and no, I'm serious.

The game consists of: Go to Acre/Jerusalem/Damascus, get the scoop on who you are supposed to kill, get all the viewpoints in the district you are exploring, do 3 of the 6 missions associated with gaining info on your target, grab a feather from your feather friend, kill the target, bathe the feather in the blood of your target, give the bloody feather to your feather friend, return to home base and get an earful from your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 boss.

The present day timeline with Desmond is also basically irrelevant since all it is is finding out that Templars still exist.\nAll in all, the only reason you should buy this game is because you want the very little back story it holds before you play Assassins Creed II, or you have already played most if not all of the series and want to go back to its roots.

I certainly know the answer to that question for myself was a passionate yes!  Occasionally as a child I would don a white sheet around my neck, painted with a red cross.  I would stealthily sneak around  my living room, surprising my family members with a cardboard dagger, I created from a produce box..\nI would pounce from behind the couch and pretend to slash my father, my mother, my brothers, it didn't matter who.  Ahh those glorious days when I was a wee lad and my imagination could run wild for hours.. or until the ADHD compelled me to find something else to do.\nWell Assassins Creed may be just the game to fill your childhood role-playing fantasy's in reality.. after all it's far better and cheaper than trying to actually become an assassin am I rite?\nTo start off with it needs to be said that Assassin Creed is the grand daddy of the Creed series, so the AI is kind of dumb and undeveloped, the game play is repetitive and the combat is slightly boring.  Yes I said it Assassin Creed on paper isn't a very good game at all....  I'm talking in 2016, where as in 2008 when the game came out it was fresh and new, so quite a few of the issues which plague the game were forgivable.  It wouldn't be a good review if I left out that the game feels very dated now.\n\nStarts you off as Altair an assassin on a mission, I won't spoil what you're after, but if you put two and two together you'll figure it out (It's pretty much a tutorial getting you familiar with the game..)  After the fairly short tutorial mission you'll awaken to find yourself in the shoes of a man named Desmond Miles..  He's being held hostage and forced to enter the Animus, a machine which can somehow bring out the memories of your ancestors.. I won't go into anymore detail as I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of discovering the story.\nThis is the meat and potatoes of any game, the actual game play.  In Assassin Creed unfortunately the gameplay gets rather repetitive, it's set up on a series of memory blocks, which are self contained stories which combine together to form the story arc.  In the game or the Animus you are greeted with 6 or 7 different investigations, 3 of which are required to access the unique Assassination.  These are generic Eavesdropping, pick pocketing, Interrogations (nearly identical to pick pocketing, only this one requires you to beat up the target for information).  The few others scattered in are timed flag captures, assassinations, and destruction mission..   This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't repeated on every stage, about 3 times per map.\nYou also have two types of collectibles, each of the 5 major areas has it's own set of collectibles.  Flags, view points and citizens... the flags offer little to no reason to actually collect them, I suppose on the console versions collecting all of them would net you an achievement or trophy, but the PC version offers nothing.  I guess this was just left over from the console version..  Competitionist will probably enjoy tracking down these little boogers, but the rest of us will just ignore them as you gain nothing from collecting them.  The view points are far more valuable as each one removes fog off the in game map, and reveals the locations of investigations, and citizens which you can rescue from harassment.  The Citizens unlike the flags actually have the added benefit of placing either a roving band of Scholars which allow you to easily escape from guards or citizens who grab and stop guards from chasing you.\n\nThe combat appears to be a button masher at first, but you'll quickly discover the true way to be a master assassin is using Counter Attack, which often times turns combat into a long drawn out affair.  Instead of mashing down the buttons and quickly ending the guards, you're left to wait for an attack.. It can take the Guards anywhere from 5 - 15 seconds to attack.  Early on in the game you're assassin seems much more capable of killing guards, normally a counter attack means the guard dies.  Later on the guards can take three or four counters to actually die.  Many encounters have the potential of having 10+ guards.  So do the math... the game is called \"Assassin\" Creed though, so you'll figure out that it's much easier to run away and hide than try and fight them all..\n\nin 2008 when the game was first released, I'd give it an easy 9/10, it was revolutionary for it's time, and presented a unique experience which was fairly lacking at the time.  In 2016 the game feels very dated.  Considering video games aren't wine being dated isn't a good thing.  So I'd say it's probably a 6/10.  Not a great game but certainly not a bad game either, far greater choices exist in 2016 which were absent in 2008.\nI'll recommend this game as it's the game which started the Assassin Creed franchise, and most people like myself just can't hop into a series in the middle.  So be Leary if you buy the game you may very well find yourself going gah, I have to do this again?  Just suck it up and plow through, the second game is only 15 - 17 hours away...", "hours": 17.2, "username": "Orge Lambart", "products": 10532, "found_funny": 11, "early_access": false}

Whenever I came across a morsel of information or a rare screenshot I couldnt help but salivate over the article. The concept was new and invigorating. I said to myself that this would be the game that got me to purchase a console. However this was not to be ( me purchasing a console ) . In fact it wasnt until several years later on steam that I got my chance to play Assassin's Creed for the first time , and I was not dissappointed.\nAssassin's Creed  is a sandbox style action-adventure-stealth game that centers around the protagonist Desmond Miles. We learn that Desmond is abducted by a pharmaceutical company called Abstergo who forces him into a machine dubbed the \"Animus\". This \"Animus\" allows its user to view the genetic memories of its ancestors , and in Desmonds case the memories of Altair Ibn-La'Ahad. An assassin who lived in the Holy Land during the 3rd crusade.\nAs Altair you will travel through Masyaf , Acre , Jerusalem , and Damascus in search of what Abstergo called \"A Piece of Eden\". While in the Animus Desmond uncovers an age old conflict between the Knights Templar and the Assassins. Through the Animus and Altair , Desmond learns a terrible truth about Abstergo and must find a way to stop them.\nAssassin's Creed was a novel attempt at a first in what has become a long series of games. It was , and still is a great looking game. Visually you can take in breath taking views of the various cities by scaling the largest buildings , and gazing out in \"Eagle View\". The structures that you climb are mostly accurte representations of actual buildings. Scaling up said structures was a favorite part of the game for me.\nCombat was fairly simple as you could quite easily dispatch a mob of gaurds easily even in the early game. Most of the side quests were repetitious and of little relevance to the overall progress of the game. However the main assassination quests were intriguing and an integral part in unlocking the secrets of \"Eden\".\nOverall I think Assassin's Creed was a novel attempt and was a much better game than some of its sequels. If you are the type of gammer that needs stellar graphics and tons of quests then this is probably not the game for you. But if you enjoy exploring and gathering intelligence to unravel a mystery then I would advise you to give Assassin' Creed a play.

With this data they are able to explore the memories of these people ancertors.\nThey are using this machine to read the genetic memory from a man who is descedant of an old Assassin who fought against the Templars during the Crusades.\nTheir main goal with it is to locate ancient artifacts known as Pieces of Eden, these are powerful relics from the ancient civilization that lived on earth before humans.\nThis is mostly what happens on all AC games.

That is a great game, but the ending of it is really rushed, and because ACB puts so much emphasis on advancing a story, the rushed ending really hurts the game.\nAssassin's Creed (1) gets criticism for being repetitive. But all AC games---and games in general---are repetitive. AC2, the pinnacle of the series, has a lot of stuff to do, but all of that stuff outside of story is centered on making money, which ultimately makes the game feel repetetive for repetition's sake since skills granted by money don't help your progression through the story (the most fun and straightforward way to finish AC2 is with your hidden blade, so all other purchased weapons are peripheral).\nIn AC1, repetitiveness arises from the structure of the game. There are three cities, each with three different districts. You have to complete about five (or six, if you include the vantage points) different kinds of missions to advance the plot and unlock new territories (whereas the feeling in subsequent AC games is that story unlocks new areas). One question then becomes: is the repetition of the structure of AC1 too simplistic? For me, the answer is no, because the variety of settings, combined with the challenge of stealth (it is harder in this one) makes AC1's repetition more complex than AC2's wait for a timer to increase my florins. (Fortunately, AC2 relies more on story to keep you playing.)\nSo the next question is: if story can make repetitive gameplay satisfying, is the story of AC1 good enough? AC2 has AC1 beat by a country mile in story. The anthology/Dickensian approch used to tell Ezio's tale is compelling. But AC1's story is much more open ended. In AC1, you keep chasing after something very mysterious. Each target you kill tells you something as they are dying that upends your first impression of them. The motives of your enemies and allies becomes complicated as the game progresses, and you feel like a tool caught in the middle. Most later AC games kind of miss this mystery, as the villains and heros are more clearly (and frankly better) defined. So the open-ended story-telling makes up for the rather shallow character progression.\nSo I think AC1 is a really good game, especially compared to later AC games (which I like a lot). The repetitive elements of the game are okay because they aren't too simplistic. The straightforward story is supplemented by great atmosphere.\nHighly recommended.", "hours": 34.8, "username": "SardonicHedgehog", "products": 290, "early_access": false}

I had to set the commands and actions myself, so that was a bit of a chore.\n3) Now to the game's story istelf. It was a little too boring for my taste; i remember predicting the ending minutes after starting the game.\n4) I had another issue about how fast travel was not introduced until later on in the game, making it a chore to go from city to city on horseback and just punishing on foot.\n5) My biggest issue; no matter what you do or how inconspicous you are, the guards are always suspicious of you! Okay, i understand that you are dressed in Assassin robes, but come on, you literally get busted for no reason!\n6) Side missions should be completed before you assassinate the target in the city for full memory synchronization.\n7) 100% completion is not worth the hassle.\nThanks for reading, hope i helped you make up your mind!", "hours": 21.8, "username": "CodeRedGamer", "products": 80, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Go figure!\n- buggy fighting mechanics\n- it was very hard to control your character\n- game has a lot of hand holding\n- confusing messages in the UI\n- mission consists of 1. Travel for ten minutes to city 2. Gather information twice 3. Plan attack 4. Attack never goes as planned\n- the fact that you have time to interrogate the target before he dies means it must be a stealth kill for privacy but never happens\n- alerts only go off when in hiding places even if you have not been found for 10 mins\n- story is Altiar is arrogant and foolish, gets demoted despite still being sent on missions to kill key targets. Assassinations are clumsy but they are planned that way for story, if this is true there is no need of planning attacks if it always boils down to a fight.\n- Desmond parts could at least let you run making exploration less time consuming and annoying.\n- the introduction from every assassination is boring and long\n- story gets interesting midway but the bad mechanics still hinder experience\n- menu won't start with controller activated\n- you can't swim FFS\n- BUG! I attempt a mission to kill kill 3 soldiers, I killed two out of 3 failing the mission but when restarting mission dead bodies are still on floor alerting guards to my presence. Pathetic!\n- these NPCs that are deranged pushing you every time you walk past are annoying and unnecessary\n- boss fights are really bad.

It has so many cool things going for it, but then there's a whole heap of things that bring it down. I guess I would give it a Yes as a recommendation via Steam reviews, but from what I've played so far, my overall opinion on the series is more neutral.\nAnyway, this is the first game in the franchise, and there are some really interesting things about it. No other game has really done free running so openly like Assassin's Creed, or approached history with such a expansive and imaginative point of view. The time period is very unique and well realized. The simple mechanics (some of which are okay, and others which unfortunately are not well polished) are also surprisingly welcome, because for someone like me, the combat and gameplay isn't exactly what draws me in, it's the world and history, so I don't want to waste my time learning some complex systems.\nI think the problems lie with the combat and movement which are extremely hit-or-miss and the storytelling. Having most of the cutscenes take place from a static third person perspective is really off putting, and gives a really poor B-movie vibe for any story that is present. As well, the whole modern timeline thing is just ridiculuous. This game (and the series as a whole) needs to do without it.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 97, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-12", "text": "This is a flawed, clunky game but it's a really, really good flawed, clunky game.\nPremise: You are Desmond, a regular guy who is kidnapped and forced to help the Templar secret society locate a MacGuffin to take over the world. You do this by strapping yourself into\n\nthe Animus to launch yourself through time and space and relive the memories of your long-dead ancestor Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, a Syrian assassin during the Third Crusade who is himself an enemy of the Templars. Alta\u00efr must assassinate nine key templars and stop the evil Robert de Sabl\u00e9 from finding the mind-controlling Apple of Eden; meanwhile Desmond must figure out in the present day what the hell his Templar captors want and how to get himself out of this situation.\nThe Good: For the time it came out, this is a really, really beautiful game, with obvious care put into the painstaking recreation of the four 12th century cities that most of the game takes place in. This game starting the Assassin's Creed tradition of perching on a high viewpoint and receiving a gorgeous rotating view of the intricate architecture of the surrounding city. There's also a lot of fun, rich history here - not exactly my thing, but even I could appreciate how much research went into this. The story, while slow, was fairly interesting with a few decent twists and turns. This includes the present-day story, which hooked me in and definitely left me wondering where the story of Desmond was going next even as I knew the story of Alta\u00efr was over. The platforming? Good lord, the platforming! Assassin's Creed has used roughly the same platforming for so long that it's a little hard to remember now, but this game did innovative things with freerunning, climbing, and exploration that are still being ripped off by a number of games to this day. There's a lot of fun side missions, and I never got tired of leaping from the rooftops to unexpectedly assassinate a corrupt guard that was giving an innocent civilian a hard time. The side missions don't have as much story as they would in later iterations of the series, but I found them very fun in a mini-game kind of way. This was a game where collecting the collectables and doing the side missions was worth the extra time spent to me, which in all my time gaming I have really only considered to be true for the Assassin's Creed series and the Arkham series - everything else loses me. Finally, the characters of Desmond and Alta\u00efr themselves are a lot of fun. Alta\u00efr walks a fine line between being a \"young, hopeful action protagonist\" and an out-of-control ego monster, and it's much more fun to have a hero so flawed.\nThe Bad: Ubisoft had not quite figured out how to do cutscenes right yet, so you get a lot of Alta\u00efr awkwardly pacing around while the head Assassin lobs exposition at him from across the room. The controls were mapped in such a nonintuitive way that probably indicates a lazy porting from console - not gamebreaking, but I did find myself needing to check the controls every few minutes, else I would end up assassinating random peasants when I thought I was pressing the button to blend in with them. Finally, as mentioned, the story is slow as molasses. It's worth it in the end, but patience is a definitely a prerequisite virtue to really enjoy this game.\nConclusion: Parts of this game almost turned me off to the Assassin's Creed series entirely with how clunky they were. But overriding a few glitches and flaws is a unique, lovingly crafted experience wrapped in a deep conspiracy theory storyline with a number of generation-defining stealth and freerunning mechanics.", "hours": 0.1, "username": "glide22", "products": 148, "early_access": false}

For that reason it's hard to give a bad review because it was so cheap, but I didn't like this game.  Assassins' Creed 2 is a different story, however.\nAnyway, the game is very repetitive and quite short.  There is not even much in the way of achievements unless you want to collect flags but the game pretty much implies that this is a worthless endeavor.\nThe game had good graphics for its time.  Perhaps that's what made it so popular, and also you can climb on just about everything.  This is the good part.\nThe problem is that you are always doing the same thing.  It's always about assassinating certain people and it's almost always done in the same way. Yeah, you have to maybe pickpocket, interrogate or eavesdrop on people before you get to the target but in the end you have to keep repeating these activities over and over again.\nThis game could make you hate poor people since the beggars will swarm around you like flies until you want to murder them even though that's evil and the guards will make your life miserable if you keep doing that.  This is one of the funnier aspects of the game but after awhile it gets annoying.\nIn the end, I felt that I was just doing the same thing over and over and over again just for slight progression in the main character's (Desmond's) story, and the game doesn't answer all the questions (hence the many, many sequels) so you don't necessarily get a good resolution.\nI have played other stealth games.  I enjoyed Tenchu 1 and 2 though they aren't super hardcore about stealth, and I've always thought that the Metal Gear Solid games did stealth well.  I especially loved how difficult Siren was with its stealth gameplay, but this game got too tiresome.  The stealth isn't particulary hard, like some of the games I played above, so I wouldn't even say it's a challenging stealth game.  I do like the parkour elements but I just wish there had been more variety to the missions you have to perform.\nI didn't like this game, but then I played Assassin's Creed 2 which is better in every possible way, so unless you want to be a completionist and play all the games I recommend skipping this one.", "hours": 24.8, "user_id": "76561197999045600", "username": "totalgarbage", "products": 333, "early_access": false}

Is the original game still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. If you can get it to work.\nYou can\n.\nPOSITIVES: The roots of everything that made the franchise famous are in the first Assassin's Creed. The parkouring and climbing work well, the cities are large and colorful with unique atmospheres, there are plenty of collectibles to while away the hours collecting. The story is pretty good. It doesn't climb the heights attained by Assassin's Creed II / Brotherhood / Revelations, but Altair's journey as an Assassin who has fallen from grace and needs to redeem himself is great, even if it's been told before in other mediums. Graphics are decent (DirectX 10). The game world actually feels larger than some of the other Assassin's Creed games, since you don't fast-travel from one city to another (not at first); you travel on dusty dirt roads through mountains and villages from one city to another. There is a lot of country to explore, and none of the areas feel re-used (though sometimes they can seem extraneous).\nNEGATIVES: The game crashes, sticks, and stutters from a variety of issues. My issues were solved by unplugging my internet while playing. The servers that Ubisoft used to authenticate this game are now offline, causing the game to briefly freeze any time I tried to load a save or the game tried to create an auto-save. Lack of an internet connection tells the game to not even bother checking, so gameplay becomes smooth. Even for a game this old, it's hard getting a constant 60fps. If you're running the DirectX 10 version, I recommend setting the Compatibility Mode to Windows Vista SP2.\nINDIFFERENT: Activities and ambient conversations recycle constantly. Stealth doesn't have much variety: hide, walk slowly, or mix with monks. Combat is actually boring \u2013 once you get the counter ability, countering everything results in a one-hit kill. If you're out exploring the Kingdom, enemy guards are extraordinarily suspicious unless Altair walks at the slowest speed possible. Takes away from the pace of the game. Oh, and don't fall into the water; Altair can't swim, and dies instantly.\nVERDICT: A pretty good Assassin's Creed game whose repetitive side-activities don't undermine a decent first attempt at a stealthy open-world-parkour-hack 'n slash hybrid.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 103, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-11-09", "text": "Assassin's Creed is a very strong game that will satisfy individiuals that love history and war, but also the real main story of Assassins Creed.\nSetting: The game is set in the Third Crusade times, the battle between Islam and Christianity. It features Desmond Miles, a protagonist in 21st Century America, which is kidnapped by the antagonist company Abstergo Industries. This company uses the Animus, a generic-memory stimulator, on Desmond to recall his memories through his ancestor Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad.\nThe cities involved are Masyaf, the assassin creed's home city, Acre, ran by the Knights Templars, and Jerusalem and Damascus, both cities ran by the Templars and enemy Saracens. There is one more city however I won't spoil it. The landscape is different for each city, but only noticable in each city. There are three districts, poor, middle, and rich district, and you would assume there are higher quality buildings as the districts become richer, but again, you can only notice them.\nPlot: The plot line is certainly intriguing. Having played AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and having not finished AC I, all the storylines from the sequels made actual sense once I completed this. Onto the plot though, there are two separate plots that do intertwine. To clarify that, there is the story of Desmond and the story of Altair and the plotlines intertwine through the story of Altair and Desmond mashing in present 21st century America (hard to explain I know). Just know, the plot makes absolute sense once you play the games. From the perspective of AC's release in 2007, it was very very intriguing to interpret the plot without knowing the sequel storylines, so the plot from that perspective is a massive plus. The finish was very surprising as well might I mention.\nAlso, I completed the game in 18 hours, which included the core plot and the main side-missions. I did not complete finding the flags and killing the templar guards as I found them to be irrelevent. I had only played 14.9 hours on Steam, however 18 hours came from I playing about 3.5 hours of the game and me realising after three hours that Steam didn't realise I was playing AC, so there was a glitch in the Steam Client.\nOnly nuisences regarding the plot is the side-missions. As you progress into the game, they become more of a chore than actual for fun, for example, when there is an investigation side mission, the guards keep on coming later in the game and is ridiculous as they are alert, and spot you without even looking at you, meaning you failed the investigation. So yes, there was a few unbalanced AI involved with the missions, but other than that, it relieves you in the end once you know all are completed.\nAnd to note, I realised why I got so bored of the game about three hours into it on my first playthrough last year, and that was because the horse riding from Masyaf to the other cities is so long, it would take at least 15 minutes to travel, ridiculous and boring especially when 'The Kingdom' is just a transition area with no real meaning.\nGameplay: Gameplay is very solid. For a game released in 2007, it is surprising to see how smooth the gameplay is. For a game that emphasises parkour and combat, I see it as a major positive adding to the game. Only negatives regarding gameplay is how basic some actions are. For example, you will notice the same amount of counters to attacks and blocks, something that I felt could have been explored further.\nSound/Dialogue/Graphics: The graphics are very good for a 2007 game. I praise that.\nDialogue is good as there is mostly variety in individual dialogues. Only negative for dialogue is the 'Save Citizens' missions, the dialogue is extremely repeatitive. There was also some minor speech issues that I had noticed.\n\nSound: Serviceable. There was rare audio issues that I encountered.\nNegatives: This review may seem very positive, but gee these negatives are really that annoying. Overall, there are several bugs and glitches I'll name a few, for 'Save Citizens' missions, you would get glitches where you could not trigger the person to speak to after completing the task. Another was camera's getting stuck on the player, especially moderately when walking through doors, completely annoying.\nOverall: A very solid game and a good first-entry to the Assassins Creed series. If you didn't bother reading the review, the plot was consistent and intriguing, the graphics were very good, the sound was servicable, the dialogue was good, and gameplay was very solid. There were several bugs and glitches within the game that completely nagged me. The game is currently worth $10 on Steam, I'd say buy it, no harm done, sets up the good foundation for the series. Now, the rating is low compared to what I mentioned in the review as it was not an excellent game by all means. 7.5/10\nEDIT: I didn't note, but since the game took me 18 hours to complete, for the individual, I would assume it would take 20+ hours to complete by doing all tasks.\n----\nThanks for reading my review!

Plus I tend not to play highly hyped games right away, unless they are titled Mortal Kombat). And I have to say this game is lovely regardless few glitches here and there.\nPros:\n- Action takes place in early middle ages (crusaders in middle east). Personally one of my favourite chapters in history.\n- Climate. Impressive, large cities. Architecture is amazing, brings up the spirit of the times. Music adds gracefully to this.\n- It's a climbing simulator.\n- It has \"find the flag\" mini-game.\n- It has story line! (don't get me wrong. If AC was only climbing simulator with find the flags mini-game it would be joy enough). Story is pretty interesting although not earth shaking. I like the feeling of ambiguity that Altair's last chats with his victims bring in.\n- You can try to play stealth if you wish.\n- Action oriented. Assassinations are pretty flashy and possible interactions with so many objects in the game can cause interesting twists. (I.e:  scored one templar kill by accident: was being chased, attracted attention of some templar I hadn't even noticed. He fell down the roof leaving me happy, although somewhat puzzled).\n- Antagonist and Protagonists: they are interesting in design. They don't feel cliche.\n- Open ending.\nCons:\n- Weird one time glitches:  Damascus contact's face started to melt down while we were chatting. Altair froze mid jump from horse back, and memory had to be reloaded.\n- Sometimes game breaking bug may happen: dead body carefully put on the ground might twitch and fell of the roof, causing havoc on the streets. Dead bodies can even jump high to the sky, before they fall. Pretty creepy.\n- Repetitive:  people who might not enjoy flags finding as much as I do can find this game repetitive. In each city there are flags, and sub-quests (view points, rescue civilians, some informer missions) that are either the same or very similar (informer missions may slightly very).\n- Out of 3 major cities, Damascus and Jerusalem feel the same (except one has yellow and the other green filter on). Travelling to Acre I could feel that this conquered by crusaders city is different and had it's own western-like touch to it.\n- Fighting mechanics is simplified and a bit clumsy, especially when you face a lot of enemies.\n- You will not exit this game easy on PC...\nIn general though: game is fun to play.

On the one hand, we have master assassin Altair letting his inflated ego get the better of him, causing him to slip up in a big way, breaking all three of the Creed's most sacred tenets. We follow his path to redemption through the task of 9 assassinations - a task that sees Altair change who he is for the better of all in the guild.\nThe story of the present day centres on Desmond Miles. This story is intermittent at best, as the majority of the game is played out in Altair's time, but to sum it up, he has been captured and forced to relive Altair's memories through a device called an Animus, able to 'view' the genetic memories of the occupant. For those that haven't played, there are spoilers, so I won't go into the details.\nThe strange dual-story actually works quite well, as subsequent games have proven in their popularity. I have played all games up to and including AC3, so in hindsight this game set the scene well for future sequels.\nControls can be clunky at times. It's easy to get used to, but something simple like running at top speed requires W for moving forward, holding down right click on the mouse to change into High Profile (think: more obvious to be spotted) actions, the space bar as well to hit the sprint and auto jump at building edges or to jump over gaps automatically... and to top it off you have to hit Shift if you want to catch yourself with a grab if you don't quite make the jump. This is an extreme case though, and it should be noted that you are encouraged to move slowly and take your time with your movements so as to not arouse suspicion from guards.\nBut wait, there's more! Running and jumping - hell even\nand jumping, is made still more ridiculous by the fact that half the time you'll end up somewhere you didn't want to go, or weren't aiming for. Case in point: walking down an alley, you suddenly decide you want to climb the walls and windows up to the rooftops. You turn around and start a run up to the wall so that you'll start climbing when you reach it... only there's this fence you'll brush past on your way there. By some fluke or quirk of fate you'll find yourself climbing the\ninstead... even though the fence is at the same level as you are. You'll find yourself hanging on to the end of this fence for dear life... because you wouldn't want to fall! The ground is literally right at your feet. Naturally you'll agree with onlookers when they start muttering \"Somebody should stop him, before he hurts himself\" and \"What a fool!\"\nSo movement can be either really funny or really frustrating depending on the situation. Weapons consist of fists (useful for getting information out of people), swords, knives, and of course the signature hidden blade we all know and love. <3 You'll find there's a pretty even spread of circumstances for using these, and once you get the counter-kill and grab-counter moves combat will be nothing more than an annoying trifle on your way to the next part in the story.\nBeing the 'assassin'-type game that it is, I find it disappointing that everything so easily turns into a bloodbath. Check my screenshots if you don't believe me. Whether it's a mission assassination or just trying to walk past a patrol, you'll soon discover people from all over the world want to throw themselves on your sword. Sometimes it takes as much as twenty bodies on the ground before your opponents realise they can't win too, and then even after you wipe out a massive group and finally become anonymous again, another patrol comes around a corner and the whole thing starts all over again. I open the map sometimes just to see if the city population changes - I'm sure I killed that many.\nGameplay consists of various mission types and collectibles in addition to the main 9 assassination missions. In order to 'access the memories' you have to do research about your targets - these can consist of taking out rooftop archers for a brother assassin that can't do it for some reason or another; a race; eavesdropping; punching up the town crier for info, then killing him anyway ^_^; pickpocket missions, and a couple of others.\nThe assassinations themselves, while I appreciate the variety of set-ups and environs, don't satisfy me as much as they could have. Unlike any nuffie guard you could off then walk away without being detected (even in front of other guards, I might add), every single core mission sees you enter these weird nowhere places where time doesn't seem to flow and you can talk to your victim regardless of the fact you just stabbed him in the neck. Afterwards you employ the 'run like hell' strategy, because somehow the whole city knows what you've done even before you get there. And there's about twenty guards in hot pursuit, because most times you dont have the opportunity to clear the area before you go in for the kill (not without alerting your mark anyway).\nLike I said, the game is a blood bath, with far too much combat and contrived scenes, and not enough stealth.\nThe graphics are passable for it's age, although I find the colour palette lacking. Jerusalem is all grey, Damascus is all terracotta, and I think Acre is a different shade of grey. To be fair Damascus is pleasant, it was definitely my favourite of all the areas. Inside the Masyaf fortress is a close second.\nI think the variety of characters is good. There are the drunks, wandering aimlessly through the streets and somehow always knowing when Altair is around so they can push him around. The town criers and their propoganda speeches will stay with you well after you finish playing (not in a good way). The beggars can get really, really, really annoying, but remember you can punch them when guards aren't alerted - they won't do anything. \"No! You don't understand - I'm poor and sick and HUNGRY!\" *BAM* Let's face it, everyone punches beggars.\nWhere the game really shines for me is its soundtrack. Especially when everything goes to hell and everyone knows you're a villain - because the music will go crazy! The chase and combat music during the core missions simply cannot be beat, I believe it's Access the Animus. It's worth a listen to. There are other great tracks as well - all done by Jesper Kyd, notorious for his awesome work on various games now. I highly recommend checking him out.\nDespite the problems I encountered, the freezes, glitched collectibles (!*$@# FLAGS!), crazy amount of guard killing and stupid auto-jumping ... I had loads of fun. And I confess the present-day story had me not just intrigued, but hooked.

Yay! You play Desmond Miles, a man with two first names pretending to be a last name. Oh, and he's also a former assassin (apparently, it never really elaborates on that beyond the initial introduction) who's forced to explore the memories of his ancestor, Altair, during the crusades of the late 12th century. This is done through a device called the Animus which probes and records \"genetic memories\", the knowledge passed down through a person's entire lineage via their genes and allows them to live out those moments in their mind as if they were their own experiences... Yeah, just go along with it, coz that's more or less what the game asks you to do since that's as much as it bothers trying to explain it. Altair is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, and after failing a mission and breaking the three main rules of the Brotherhood (don't kill in daylight, never get water on your target, and never feed them after midnight), is demoted and sent on a series of assassinations to restore his name and rank, but along the way discovers there is something much bigger at work connecting all his targets. Dun-dun-duuuuun! But this is where my first problem with the game crops up.\nThe story just didn't grab me at all. It's incredibly ham-fisted in what it's trying to do, and rather than find it interesting or pushing me forward, it felt like it got in the way of the gameplay, and if anything, maybe even held it back. Had it been done without all the half-*ssed science fiction elements and instead remained tied to its time and setting it would have been a perfectly enjoyable story about the hidden histories that shaped the world and the shadowy organisations behind them. What we're given instead just feels too underdeveloped to truly care about in the end, much like the main characters, in fact. Desmond/Altair doesn't really have much range or depth, having about as much personality as a balloon with a serious face drawn on it, and at times comes dangerously close to being unlikable. And what's especially infuriating about them is how nosensical their choices seem or how nochalant they are about their situations, making it difficult for us to care about them. The voice acting is largely passable, but still very much of the old-school gaming mentality of sounding like a Saturday morning kid's show where half the characters sound like they're reading from a script and throwing subtly out the window rather than feeling like real people having real conversations. Any sense of naturalistic interaction is lost completely and only adds to the difficulty of being able to invest in the story or its figures, which is all the harder to bear given how much they focus on them being a thing you should care about. In fact, having come fresh off of finishing Portal 2 and hearing all the amazing voice work in that, it's made even more apparent just how mediocre it is here. But all that could be forgiven and forgotten, because what really matters is the gameplay, right? Well, actually... that's where the next problem comes.\nThe structure is fairly straightforward. There's three main cities in the game connected by a large hub area, each city having three districts which are gradually unlocked one by one, and each district having a main target for you to eventually kill. You run around a district completing objectives which give you information on your target before having enough to finally do the deed itself. Objectives range from eavesdropping on conversations, interrogating enemy cohorts, saving citizens from vicious beatings, assassinating smaller targets, or several other tasks of little consequence. Unfortunately, though, that's pretty much the entire game right there. You'll go to one district, do all the objectives, complete the mission, then move on to the next one all excited to see what other fun and creative tasks you'll be given, only to find you have to repeat almost exactly the same events all over again. And that's the cycle the game repeats from start to finish. Once you've played the first district you've essentially played them all. There's nothing fundamentally wrong about the gameplay at its core, I just wish they'd given me something more to do over the 20+ hours I put into it. Sure, there's collectibles scattered everywhere in the form of flags... hundreds and hundreds of flags... but there's no real point to hunting them down. There's nothing awarded for finding them all, and beyond acting as intermediary save points they may as well not be there. Maybe if they had've unlocked files for real world information about the locations or the historical figures or the crusades themselves then they would have made for some compelling artifacts, but nah, nothing.\nIts main saving grace, though, are the View Points, buildings that can be climbed to uncover the map of the immediate area and locations of objectives. Monkeying your way up a structure then diving back down to street level can be fun sometimes, but largely it's the chance to take in the cities as a whole that impresses most, and they really are impressive. That's really the star of the game, in fact. The sheer scale of each city and the huge crowds that fill it along with the meticulous detail everywhere is clearly where a lot of work and love went here. The surface of almost every wall has something climbable if you look for it, and a vast array of beams and poles and scaffolding connects the buildings at every turn. I never tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could make your way across the rooftops from one end of a city all the way to the other without your feet ever touching the ground of the streets and having to interact with all the filthy plebs below. I don't envy the people whose job it was to check that every structure was spaced correctly and that movement could be maintained as fluidly and enjoyably as it is. So I really have to take my hood off to them for that achievement.\nBut while movement is a joy and tends to work just fine the majority of the time, combat is a whole other matter. The game really owes a lot to Prince of Persia, from the way it looks and feels, to even the majority of the animations which appear to be almost identical, but the mechanic I wish they'd abandoned from it is the combat. It was fine in small doses in PoP, but there's too much of it here that largely feels clunky and boring, with a fairly small weapon and move set, and little or no variety in enemy types beyond a palette swap or doing and taking more damage. Maybe if some enemies were in armour that gradually had to be stripped away, or some were on horseback or had other types of weapons that brought their own unique challenges it wouldn't have been so bad. Sure, there's always the option to run and hide, but even that can be tedious at times, given how often you'll have to engage with enemies.\nOverall, while it's not a bad game, with plenty of enjoyment to be had, it's just one that holds so much potential, yet, sadly falls short far too often. Had it been given another 6-12 months development time I'm sure it could have been a classic for the ages, but as it is, it's merely a good, enjoyable stop along the road to far better titles.", "hours": 27.5, "username": "JacquesLeSauve", "products": 1337, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

After a 100th time they were just distracting game elements that you kind of had to grind through without feeling rewarded for it.\n- The missions were quite repetative which made the story linear. I felt like the game didn't take full advantage of the open world possibilites.\n- I didn't feel motivated to collect all the flags because there were way too many of them and I didn't see any reward behind it.\n- I never understood the necessaty of the fixed camera positions in the bureau scenes.\n- Did encounter a few glitches like character getting stuck in weird places, occasional frame rate drops but nothing game-breaking. The biggest issue was probably the game not responding to keystrokes at times, especially when initializing run or sprint.\n- Exiting the game was a weird lengthy process. The easiest solution was to just force quit it.", "hours": 27.1, "user_id": "76561198027692026", "username": "Jamez", "products": 184, "early_access": false}

It's a good introducton to the world of the assassins.\n-gameplay may be dull or repetetive in the sense of story (same citys)\nNegative:\n-those \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing 'side quests' :D saving people from guards, I mean c'mon...\nAll in all one of the best games I ever played, looking forward to play the second one!", "hours": 21.2, "user_id": "76561198169331227", "username": "\u2764 DarkFairy\u2764", "products": 14, "early_access": false}

Run a bit and you get caught. Bump into someone, you get caught. It's fun the first few times, but gets really annoying after a few hours.

It's very well presented and entertaining, albeit repetitive and mundane at moments. My favorite aspects of the game are the story and general ambiance.\nThe plot follows Desmond, a bartender who's kidnapped by a corporation due to his lineage to assassins. After he's forced into a simulation that recreates the past by using the user's DNA, the player assumes control of Altair, a Crusades-era Middle Eastern assassin. After failing to follow a tenet of his organization, he's ordered to assassinate a set of targets in order to redeem himself. As he investigates his targets, he and Desmond begin to unearth a series of conspiracies. It's an interesting, well-written, and believable story. While it isn't remarkable, it manages to entertain.\nIn terms of atmosphere, the game has a simply sublime aesthetic due to it's blend of a Crusades-era Middle Ages and a modern-day subtle cyberpunk setting. The art direction is also great, and as a result it's visuals are arguably better than some later iterations in the series.\nHowever, gameplay-wise, it fails to live up. The story segments are enjoyable, however, in order to reach these segments, Altair has to investigate his targets. This consists of repeatedly racing across the map, beating up a target for information, and so forth. The game is also infamous for it's collectibles, which are arduous to collect and fail to provide a proper reward.\nOverall, Assassin's Creed is worth playing if one's interested in it.

Who made it? Ubiso... Well, nevermind.\nAs far as my memory goes back and as strong as it is, I will tell you something about the Story first. You are playing as Ezio Auditore... later in another game... No, you are someone else in this game. You are the allmighty overpowered and underestimated Desmond Miles (who happens to be the main character but nobody gives a sh*t). Thanks to modern technology you are able to lay down and virtually slip into the Anime (or what ever that thing was called) to connect with the memories of your grand-grand-granddaddy's.\nEven so that in later Episodes of the game you have been given live to the next generation and still are genetically able to relive the life of your Grandparents story, you are pretty much unable to resist doing what the evil doctors tell you when they first put you in the Animu (or whatever) to become Alta\u00efr, first of the Assassins in your Bloodline.\nNow, even so that Raymond is unable to fight back with an simple \"No\", Alta\u00efr is able to climb the highest buildings around, take a snapshot from above, jump and fall a gazillion miles into an haystack precisely and is still able to get up after and kill a bad guy just before he takes an relaxing walk through the town on the rooftops. Shame on you Superman, you will never be that cool.\nAs the Story goes on, you will find out that your major target as an assassin are the Knights of the Cross, which are all over the place. After their search for taking the land and in search for the wholy grail they slowly running into your blade with open arms. You for your turn as the player would wish for Coconuts instead of the endless horsetrips through the outbacks of mountains and deserts. It is not that it doesn't look good, it is more about the \"running in circles\" that is taking the fun out of it.\nDesmond gets out of the Anonymus from time to time and sniffs around, when it is possible, to become aware of the connections between the past and present lifes until \"Spoiler\" the game almost ends.\nAs clever as it is and as good as it sells.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 124, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-05-22", "text": "Pros:\nInteresting Story.\nMechanics learnt gradually.\nRe-playable missions.\nGood mixture of stealth and combat.\nGood combat mechanics.\nCons:\nRepetitive missions.\nUn-skippable long cut-scenes.\nMusic is short and only plays at certain times, leaving long periods with only abidance sounds.\nStory:\nAssassin's Creed has two main stories: That of the present with bartender Desmond Miles who has been captured by a large pharmaceutical company called Abstergo and forced to re-live the genetic memories of his ancestor Altair, and that of Altair himself, who is an Assassin in 1192, during the Third Crusade, sent on a mission to kill nine men who bring war apon the land.\nDesmond is told that Abstergo seeks information from him, and that a machine which can make him relive the memories of Altair will help uncover than information. While in the past, Altair makes a series of deadly mistakes which harms the Assassin Brotherhood. He is demoted by his master and sent on a mission to kill nine men. Some of them Crusaders, some of the Saracens. But all are working together for an odd purpose under the leadership of the French Crusader, Robert de Sabre. With each kill, a rank, equipment and abilities are returned to Altair and he will learn more about why these nine men work together.\nAssassin's Creed largely takes place in the Holy Land of 1192 in five locations: The mountain fort and village of Masyf which is home of the Assassins, The Saracen-controlled cities of Damascus and Jerusalem, the Crusader-controlled city of Arce, and the Kingdom, which represents the lands in-between all four cites.\nIn Damascus, Jerusalem and Arce, three each of these men wait. Altair must travel to them and preform investigations to uncover his target's location and use the information to decide how to approach and kill each target.\nMechanics:\nIn order to find a target, Altair must preform a series of Investigations. These take several forms: Eavesdropping on conversations to learn information, pickpocketing letters which explain more about his target's purpose and helping fellow Assassin's by assassinating other targets amongst others.\nWhile playing as Altair, you spend your time in one of two states: Low Profile and High Profile, which are changed by pressing a button. In Low Profile, Altair preforms socially acceptable but slower actions, allowing him to navigate his way without drawing attention, such as following a target or remaining hidden. In High Profile, Altair preforms aggressive and socially unacceptable actions, allowing him to run or enter combat. Knowing the right time to use Low or High Profile is key.\nThe Blend mechanic allows Altair to blend crowds to help me remain hidden. This can be done either alone, or within groups of roaming monks to help him access places guarded. If guards are chasing him, he can attempt to blend within crowds, benches or haystacks to lose their sight of him and return to being hidden.\nAlmost every building or surface is climbable, allowing free running and parkour to get you to locations and out of trouble, from leaping from beam-to-mean, to climbing up a tall spire. If it sticks out, you can grab onto it. This also allows you to see the city surroundings.\nOnce investigations have been completed, Altair can then attempt to assassinate his target, which can often be done in multiple ways. The environment allows for multiple approaches to a target, and mission replayability means a player can play the mission again and try to assassinate a target in a diffrent style.\nEach time a target is killed, Altair and the target engage in conversation, and each target always defends their actions, believing they are doing good and leaves Altair wondering if they really are deserving of death.\nCombat mechanics:\nAltair has access to five weapons: A sword, dagger, hidden blade, throwing knives and his fists. The sword is a slow but powerful weapon, the dagger is faster than the sword, but deals less damage. The hidden blade is a one-hit, one-kill weapon, but only to character who are unaware of Altair. The fists are used for beat-up missions, where Altair attempts to get information from un-cooperative people.\nCombat is preformed in the both Low and High Profile states, and which state you are in determines the actions taken. For example: Wielding a sword in Low Profile and pressing Action allows Altair to attack, built pressing Action in High Profile allows Altair to counter an attack in-stead.\nAltair can also grab people to throw them off ledges to their deaths, or just down on the ground so they are out of combat for a few seconds. However, the enemies also have access to the same abilities Altair has. Enemies are split into three categories: Solders, Elites and Commanders: Solders are weak but often come in larger numbers. They take only a few hits to die and die to one counter-attack. Elites deal more damage, have more health, can grab and throw Altair, and take two counter-attacks to die. Commanders have even more damage and health than Elites, can break Altair's defence to leave him exposed to an attack, can counter-attack themselves and die to three counter-attacks. The can easily be identified by their uniform. Diffrent combat stratus are needed to fight depending on who you are facing.\nMusic:\nMusic is good, but sparse. Every time Altair enters a new location, a certain music track will play, but it is short, acting more like an announcing theme than actual music, and won't play again for some time. There is also a track for Altair being chased and Altair in combat, depending on what city he is in. While outside of combat, music is replaced by ambience.\nOther:\nThere are alot of collectables: Each location has one hundred flags to collect (with the exception of Masyf, which has twenty) as well as sixty Templars to assassinate spread over the Holy Land and View Points to Synchronise. All locations can be revisited after the first time there.\nOverall, a great game. Well-written story but the cut-scenes are long and un-skippable, so any replays means you have to watch them all the time. Missions can be replayed to assassinate a target how they want and in a diffrent style each time, but investigations often lack variety. Hunting collectables can be fun, but also irritating without a guide after so many have been found.", "hours": 71.1, "user_id": "76561198047916723", "username": "PyroANTIC", "products": 127, "early_access": false}

But storyline-wise, PLAY IT.\nIf you are like me and love playing console originals that have been ported to PC with a controller, then I would not suggest sitting too far away from the screen with this game. When it says partial controller support, it means it. The first time you run the game you are gonna be required to use the keyboard and mouse to skip the long intro cutscene (you are gonna want to do this every time you run it actually) and to actually get to the main menu. After that, you gonna need to re-map ALL of the controls. The triggers don't register, so use the bumpers instead. Not to mention, if you are indeed coming from some of the later AC's, the combat and parkour system will feel VERY sluggish/non-responsive. But this is the first game: of course it will be that way.\nBeyond that, the game is awesome so far. The storyline, I will agree, is VERY repetitive, but pay attention to the meetings with the leader. This is definitely where they introduce the Templars and WHY the Assassins hate them. Not to mention, you start to see the changes in both Alta\u00efr and Desmond with every meeting / Animus break.\nOkay, time for my little goings-on about the graphics.\nWhile not as intensive as Black Flag, the graphics for AC1 are both crisp and pretty detailed given when the game was published.\nOverall, 9/10 because of repetitiveness.

It's quite bleak and lacks a lot of colour. The controls were also an abomination.\n- Graphically it's nothing fantastic. Even during release it was arguably poor graphics for its time.\n- For a game about assassination it's surprisingly lacklustre when it comes to the act itself. It's not really a stealth game, there aren't many creative ways to carry out assassinations...it's just odd. Assassin's Creed II struggled with this as well, but it was far more fun and interesting, so I can forgive it.\n- Constant repetition with menial tasks, like eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Boring.\n- Pause interface is obstructive and annoying.\nOverall Score 4/10\nIn my experience the games in the Assassin's Creed series are decent but have never had that 'wow' factor.

This game is what started it all for Ubisoft, love 'em or hate 'em. This game features a conflict between Templars and Assassins in a historical setting. If you love history then this is a great game for you. The atmosphere in the game is very good, it makes you feel like you're alone in this dark and deadly journey for redemption. The three main cities you explore are nice and detailed. The stealth aspect isn't perfect, but it is interesting and fun to play with. The combat is also interesting, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy. The story, if you pay attention, is great and mysterious. There's also a parcour system that allows you to climb buildings all sneaky like.\nHowever, this game has many flaws. Towards mid-game point, the game becomes very repetitive, having you doing the same missions over and over again. What sucks is that to progress in the game, you must do these boring missions to get the next piece in the story. At points you might not care for the good story this game has because of tedious tasks.\nI love history and conspiracies, so this game was right up the alley for me. The combat and stealth was intersting at first but the game does get repetitive. I really like this game and it's one of the better ones in the franchise in my opinion.

Climbing viewpoints gets tedious most quickly, and there are (by my count) 91 of them in the game. Some aren't that high, but some are these ridiculous towers it takes probably well over a minute to climb, sync and dive from.\nThe free running feels good, except when you randomly stop climbing or you randomly fail to jump to or grab something or it just doesn't respond properly in the heat of the moment.\nThe combat is alright, but it doesn't really make sense that when you're surrounded by enemies, only one attacks you at any given time.\nThe graphics are still decent, but even with the highest settings there's heavy LOD-popping going on as you roam around, especially in 'the kingdom', the area in between the key cities. And the shadow resolution drops, jarringly, for anything further than a few metres from you. People even popped into existence before my eyes once or twice. You do get to ride a horse through the kingdom though, which is strangely satisfying.\nThe story is alright but the most interesting part is the 'present day' stuff, which really doesn't tell a proper story, more like the first couple of chapters.\nOh and you know what's the most annoying? The drunks, beggars and deranged who annoy the absolute shitzu out of you any time you're on street level.\nSo... I strongly suggest watching the cutscenes on YouTube and skipping right to the second game, unless you're the neurotic type who feels compelled to play through all of them (like me).

That's not to say this game is bad, it's just one that has sequals which far exceed the original.\nAdvertising itself as a \"next-gen\" (beginning of Xbox 360/PS3 era) game, in retrospect this game definitely looks (emphasis on the \"looks\") that way. Set in the 12th century during the Third Crusade, AC1 tells the tale of an underground battle between two opposing factions that has gone on since the begginnings of our species, and you play as Altair, a member of the Assassin Order. The plot is not the most exciting part of the game, but the ideas about human nature were enough to keep me interested into it to a certain extent. The characters are forgetable, besides our protagonist. Altair is a rather brash Assassin who fails a mission in the opening act of the game, and this game details his journey to get back to his previous rank within the Assassin Order. Besides the out of place American accent (ugh), Altair is a rather badass and interesting protagonist who keeps the plot afloat.\nOn the other hand, the world which the game is sent in is rich and engrossing. The graphical quality greatly reflects the world of the Crusade, and cities are full of NPC's which go about on their day. The sheer size of the maps will surely impress if this is your first AC game. Immersion is also something this game nails on the head, despite its numerous flaws. The soundtrack may not be entirely memorable, but it nonetheless fits the game extremly well. Voice work (minus Altair) is definitely of a high quality and fits in as well. However, do not look to this game as a history lesson that is 1:1 with reality. This game does take history and makes it fit into a video game, and isn't entirely accurate (which the game acknowledges).\nThis goes into a part of the game that is really up to opinion when it comes to the story: You're actually reliving the memories Altair, who is the ancestor of our true protagonist Desmond. Here you meet Lucy and Videc, one of which is a rather bland assistant character, while the other is an evil scientist. While these characters came across as rather boring to me, Desmond's character really makes them seem like works out of Shakespear. Desmond is an EXTREMLY bland character, and one that I honestly didn't care about. The game pulls your out of the Animus (the device used to relive memories) after every chapter, and these segmants are real pacebrakers, despite some interesting conversations between Desmond and Videc here and there.\nAnother issue I have withe the games story is how abrupt the ending is, and a plotpoint that comes up near the end of the game without explanation and just feels like it's there to break immersion and be picked up later on. While I wont go into details, the game definitely makes it feel as if it NEEDS to have a sequal, whether you as the player likes it or not.\nWhile it may seem as if I hate this game, I must say I actually did have an enjoyable experience with the gameplay. Sure, the game is repititive with the same objective structure being true for 85% or so of the game: Complete 3 missions, and assassinite your target. While this may definitely be a problem for some, the gameplay does work quite well to break this problem apart.\nA staple of Assassins Creed is its parkour and stealth mechanics, and both are present and enjoyable to do here. Soaring across the games three cities is enjoyable, and stealth can be very rewarding in the game as it is quite difficult to pull off compared to the sequals. Combat is also very rich, and has many sides to it (even though it becomes pathetically easy with counters). You can dodge, block, grab, and slash at your opponents with various tools at your disposal: a sword, a shortsword, throwing knives, and the iconic hidden blade (and also your fists, of course).\nThe objectives your are required to complete before assassinations are quite repepitive however, and may be something you may not enjoy. I personally found informer challaneges to be very tricky, while pickpockets and interrogations were far too easy. And eavesdropping is... well... sitting on a bench, and that's that. Assassinations are, however, very enjoyable and can be done in a variety of manners, and are followed by extremly intense escpae sequences that will keep you on your toes.\nWhile there are some optional activities (saving civilians, collect-a-thons, and scaling every viewpoint), the game doesn't offer too much else. and is purely an action adventure game rather than an RPG (like its sequals). This is why Assassin's Creed is honestly a game that doesn't have too much replay value, even though the adventure is about 15 hours and is overall enjoyable, if not repitive for 85% of the journey and telling of a story that isn't too memorbale, despite the immersive world presented. $20 may be a bit too much for how shallow AC1 is (and considering you can buy the more polished sequals for the same price), and if you're curious I would advice that you wait for this to go on sale and to have an open mind. However, the game should keep you entertained enough to be interested in AC2, which is definitely a GOOD thing.\nOverall, AC1 is a decent first game into the AC franchise, and one you should approach with some caution, and avoid if you've played the other AC games (unless you're extremly curious). I would give this game an overall 7/10, however if I had to take replayability into account it's definitely a 6/10.", "hours": 16.1, "username": "Stadarooni", "products": 132, "early_access": false}

This game possesses a very historically-centric plot and the parkour gameplay foundation that the franchise, and many others, now use.\nFirst off, the gameplay has aged somewhat badly, particularly if you've played any other parkour movement games released since. The movement in this game is noticeably slower than its sequels, especially when climbing up the sides of towers and buildings. The combat, however, is both better and worse than that in the sequels. It is much simpler, not allowing nearly as many options in combat and can be very slow when fighting multiple opponents. On the plus side, it is more difficult than the newer Assassin's Creed games, actually providing somewhat of a challenge in combat.\nNow, the real highlight of this game is the plot. While it may be told in a very weak way, with you doing the same things over and over in different locations and being rewarded with a monologue, it is a very thematically/morally strong plot. It addresses the nature of good and bad on a very deep level and if you enjoy philosophy or analyzing morality, you will love it.

I remember watching a friend play almost all of this game when it was first released on xbox 360 and i remember how blown away i was by its fluid character movement through games open world something i had never seen before this game. The game had amazing music, sounds, world detail, combat, and story that made me very very hopeful for the future of gaming. I remember saying to my friend that it would be the most amazing thing after a few more installations of this IP how great it would be to have the games story move into the modern era with Desmond taking town to new templars. While i have not actually played the rest of the overkill that is AC annual releases it does not seem to have done this yet\u2026 This game remains very good.\nHOWEVER!\nThis is a Ubisoft Title and with that comes the 90% of the time fact that it will just not run on computers a few years newer than the game very well (ie XIII & Beyond Good & Evil)\nA few of things i ran into finally playing this game in the year 2015 and what i had to do to make it work for me.\n-Absolutely no in-game overlays can exist it will just crash. raptr, steam overlay, caused ShadowPlay caused crashes for me. Shadow Play also caused graphical artifacts and sound distortion randomly. (while having all of these turned off or disabled there were still time that game crashed but i was able to get past the title screen)\n-The game will crash at random times when you complete certain actions like killing a templar in the game world because the game tries to connect to ubisoft server that does not exist anymore. Its recommended that you turn off the internet to computer you are playing it on but you can also use your firewall setup to block it.\n-iirc correctly this game may have come out before the wireless xbox 360 setup was available for pc. I \u201cthink\u201d it was patched in later in the version that you can buy on steam. So the game does see the \u201cwireless\u201d controller but by default it is set-up incorrectly the triggers serve as camera movements left and right but are opposite. the colors of the buttons and on screen prompts are counter clock-wise wrong by one position. this can all be fixed with a little bit of tinkering in the buggy options menu or in the ini files.\n-not as important but still relevant. this is an open world game with  many thing to find and collect. two of which i found rather pointless. Flags & Templars. They serve no real purpose in the game. they existed on the console version for achievements and trophies that do not exist on the pc version at all steam or uplay. This is not a uplay game just fyi it was long before it existed and was never incorporated. but anyways while i am usually one to take my time and find all of the things in games this game gave me no motivation to do so, neither achievements or in game unlockables\u2026\n-the actual controls and character movements now feel very tank like. a sort of inbetween modern 3rd person games and classic tomb raider for lack of better comparison.\nIn conclusion This IS a great game and it is very fun but it was not made to be future proof. It takes a good bit of work to enjoy. I can't recommend it on modern systems but if you are willing to do the work get it running it is a lot of fun perhaps mostly nostalgia.", "hours": 28.1, "username": "Artyom Havok", "products": 1374, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Which would have been pretty bad if I didn\u2019t seeing as I binge traded for pretty much the whole franchise.\nThe main impression I got from people was that the story was good but the gameplay was repetitive to the point of you just wanting to get to the end ASAP. Which, in ways, it was repetitive. But for me it was more than tolerable. The story kept me interested enough for me to not really mind all that much.\nIt has a \u201cBatman Arkham City\u201d feel to it. Or at least for me it did. The world is open but there are a limited range of activities you can actually do.\nStory wise, I enjoyed it! I constantly wanted to know what was going on and I wanted answers, dang nab it! At points it messed with my head, made me think of all kinds of weird possible plot twists and weird philosophical theories on truth and reality. Which is great! Might just be me but you gotta love games that poke at your brain a little.\nThere was a whole element to the game that kind of comes up in-between chapters that I didn\u2019t even know existed. You don\u2019t really see that side to it in the trailers so that was interesting to me.\nI played through this with (well, at the same time as) a friend whilst on call and from the profanity that came from my mouth and just how angry I was getting at times it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he thought I hated this game. A few times I did actually shout \u201cOH MY GOD I HATE THIS GAME\u201d.\nBut it was lies! Point being that even though I raged quite a lot, I still really enjoyed it.\nThe mechanics for the game are great, the parkour kind of free-running stuff is really fun when it\u2019s not being annoying (although you get used to it), the combat is fun but was the main part I raged at to be honest. (Probably just horrific at it). The assassin/stealth parts of the game are also really good. Makes you feel all badass being able to be really sneakily stealth kill some suckra then free-run your way out of it.\nOne thing I kept in mind the whole time whilst playing this game was that this game is pretty darn old. It was released around 2007 or somewhere around there. I think it\u2019s been touched up since then, but still for how old it is especially, it\u2019s a good game.\nAll in all, I like it and I look forward to continuing the franchise!\nTL;DR : Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (although it\u2019s not that bad) but it makes up for that with an interesting story.

I think in the 19 hours I have recorded, I encountered 10, which doesn't sound much, but is built up enough over the course of the game, that you're taken out of the experience by expecting one at any time; and they can come at any time; cutscenes, gameplay, and so forth.\nThe humble yet fascinating beginning of the lore throughout this franchise, as expected, remains highly enjoyable, especially if you're an alternate history buff.  This is about the only positive thing to be said.\nIf you're somebody who's lived under a rock and want to finally get into this huge gaming franchise you can't stop hearing about, I'd say go straight to AC2 (a buttery smooth, utterly flawless port, with superior visuals to the console versions) and read a Wikia article/YouTube vid/etc on the first game.  If you're one of these people who absolutely must experience the story first hand, then wait until this is absolutely pennies in one of Steam's sales.", "hours": 19.4, "username": "GloriousEuropa", "products": 658, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It also has amazing graphics for it's time and age which is a really great thing. In this review I'm going to be letting you know about the good and the bad for this game, (although it's generally good and I would highly reccomend).\nSomething that I thought was great about this game is that it wasn't one of them horrible console to PC ports with horrible controls. It worked absolutely fine, and though I haven't, I'm sure it would also work great with a controller. Now, that aside, the general controls for the game were... let's say interesting. This is not because of it being a port, but part of the storyline. Basically you complete the levels in the Anamus and are reliving your ancestors memories. You have to be completely in sync with what they did, therefore as you are playing through their memories, the controls are a bit weird. For instance, you can't simply press the space bar to jump, you need to press 'W', the right mouse button and then the SPACE bar. There are many other examples aside from that too.\nThe storyline for this game is absolutely amazing. You start of as a reckless assassin, ignoring the clear rules of the assassin code, therefore having your rank stripped of you. To regain your rank, the assassin leader, Al Mualim, requests for you to kill 9 'corrupt' leaders in different cities. Around the cities you learn more evidence about whatever plot or plan the leader's are planning, eventually you kill the leaders ect. The end of the game has a very dark twist, and I'm not going to tell you, because that would be spoilers but if you play the game with no knowledge of it, such as I did, it will be quite a shock. The game also has quite a good storyline outside of the Anamus, as you have been kidnapped by modern day Templars who are using your ancestors memories to locate the other Apple of Eden's scattered across the world.\nThe gameplay for this game was generally good, but it could get quite clonky at times when trying to face more than 10 other enemies at a time especially if they are templars or highly suspicious guards. The game was also pretty repetitive as every time you entered a city you have to complete 3 investigations, such as earsdropping, stealing, interrigation and more. When finally facing the target things become less repetitive as each target has something different up their sleave leaving things to get more and more difficult.\nOverall I really enjoyed this game and would highly reccomend it. I would rate this game an 8/10.", "hours": 22.7, "username": "Jack", "products": 137, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 133, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-02-28", "text": "Adding to what most major commentors have posted, I feel that most do not mention or even consider the context of this game, in regards to its problems as well as achievements:\nMost reviews are written several years post release, and it started to get the attention it deserved by the masses starting AC2, which was 2 years after release.\nTo start, this game is a very deep and plays magnificently with your imagination.\n+ An audience which does not consider philosophical/theological as well as historical, anthropological and political matters will not get the full depth of this game. Since it will not resonate or inspire their imagination as much.\n+ Supporting the previous point: the historical accuracy/plausibility is brilliant, considering how history is normally retold in the media.\n+ In connection to the first point: The main character is not as bland as he seems (nor does any other character to be honest). We have seen multiple main characters in many other games that said and did less. Clearly this main character hasn't resonated with everyone in the audience, but not everyone is capable of understanding the depth behind his statements, the fact that they're at times laconic gives them more depth (however, not everyone perceives it so).\n+ A great many small details which show the care of the development team (ex: the changing of the sword which you carry as the game progresses, this is not easily noticeable. Enemies that are not hit fatal blows will yell and bleed on the floor in agony, just as real sword battles should do. You can even end their misery. Ability to switch between weapons and fighting styles, very easily. Environmental ambience, architecture, music, character modelling, and actors. They thought of having the A.I react to you climbing, by throwing rocks at you. Having an enemy climb down a ladder while you are on it, they will kick you. Ability to push enemies off roofs to their deaths mid-combat. Tons of details)\n+ A wide range of new inovations or smoother implementations of mechanics and aspects are presented in this game, which makes it more noteworthy. (i.e: freerunning, melee combat, horse riding)\n- Game is made for consoles, so the PC version has more bugs and glitches. Full HD resolution is also unstable, which is why it is greyed out in the menu. I have replayed this game on xbox without facing any bugs, however I tried to revisit it on PC and it was a bit bothersome, especially with the game randomly crashing at times (since, I was trying to play it in full resolution.\n+ The amazing quality of the graphics (in full resolution only), everytime I revisit or look again at this game, I am simply amazed by how visually appealing this game is.\n-+ The repetitive format of the missions was for a reason, adding to the realism by needing to scout and survey before actually doing the mission. (This along with a few other small aspects from AC 1 and 2 are echoed but not well enough in AC:Unity). However, I agree that it negatively impacts that section of the game's replayability. +But these are optional and you are not forced to complete them.\n-+ Hand to hand combat isn't that great either, the fact that the option is there is good though (however you are forced to use it in some side missions), but the ability to use it to throw enemies as a finisher is pretty cool. In AC 2 they address this melee problem and make it very desirable to use since you can start using any enemy weapon through this, also fun to watch disarms (I'm not sure about being able to kick your opponents when they're on the ground was added in AC 1 or 2, so I wont place it).\n+-Not being able to swim isn't a negative, considering how much the developers worked on the huge range of things in the game. I think the reason they did this (choosing not to implement swimming) was because of the A.I, which might be why in the following ACs, the AI still cannot swim and die when they touch the water.\n+ Adding to the previous note on Altair, his voice actor here is brilliant, unlike the later AC:Revelations actor who gives the young version of Altair a very American Hollywood accent. Then again, a big part of the original team, including Patrice D\u00e9silets (One of the main creators of the game) was forced to quit around the time of the development of AC:Brotherhood (which I consider the beginning of the winding road which sent the series to its demise, losing most of what it originally had, with whatever remaining as bare bones).\n+ This game replies to real world context of a prejudiced audience and biased media. Which again, links to the first point regarding the historical links, philosophy, movement of people and ideas. I truly felt (and still do) that this game broke through multiple barriers.\nTo elaborate on this character's development, and compare him to the similar theme with other AC main characters. We see him in the beginning as brash, arrogant and impetuous. However, when faced with the reality (of whatever, the real world, 'the truth', responsibility, or you could consider all the above), they quickly mature and become the wise and calm sage-like individuals (or at least calmer, they're still human). This again links to the pursuit of knowledge, truth and philosophy, mentioned above. We see this pattern with all the main characters, but most quickly with Altair, which Ezio remarks on in admiration when he was discovering the past of his ancestor. This is why I liked AC:Revelations more in comparison to Brotherhood, since you get to see the older Altair as well as the older Ezio, with the similarities more explicitly shown, and one of the many patterns of humans and individuals is shown, simply put as 'the repetition of history', which is another major theme in the series.\nAnd replying to 3 unique criticisms, which I felt rated the game on idealistic, current (2014-2015) expectations:\n-Little Interaction with crowds: What? This game putting in a huge and vibrant crowd, which is pretty amazing considering its pioneering position. In the sequel which is released 2 years later, they make it possible to hide within crowds. In this game however, you see early mechanics of such, ex: sitting on benches between people, using monks to hide between them as your crowd to blend in.\n-Emptiness between cities: this \u201cemptiness\u201d was quite a rich area, which showed small farming towns, with farmers, military outposts, trade checkpoints, patrols, rich and diverse landscape of the Levant, with mountains and open fields. It was actually quite impressive, and a great way to explore the new horse riding system they implemented.\n-The cliff-hanger ending: This game was released as simply \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d and not \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed: Arrival\u201d. The game needed an ending which showed the continuity of the story and history, that you (as desmond) are nothing special, and that you are simply a piece of a long line of others like you. And at the time of the release, it was not certain that they would or would not make a sequel, which is why they left it with a possibly open ended ending so to be able to carry on from it. I remember it was amazing to see such an ending and I truly hoped to see a continuation, which was very well done with the elaboration regarding the First Civilization and conspiracy theories (I can\u2019t say the same about the  later conspiracy puzzles and such, which for example: was noted in Brotherhood for its sub-par quality in comparison to 2, which is why they completely removed those conspiracy puzzles).\nThus in context, this game did so much that was right for its time, that it released a very long and drawn out series because of it. A very similar comparison is with CoD 1 and its later successors.\nIn summary, this is one of the games that I would consider well made and it doesn't deserve the 7/10s that have been posted by so many others. This game truly deserves a 9.5/10 considering the huge step it to it took in so many aspects.", "hours": 6.2, "user_id": "76561198007447584", "username": "Cpt Adham", "products": 355, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 133, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-02-27", "text": "I want to mention that this is my second time when I finish this game, the first time I've did almost 7 years ago, on a pirated copy. I didn't remember much from that period because I was young and didn't payed too much attention to the story or the details, so I really enjoyed this second playthrough, because I was able to learn much more.\nImpressions & Score:\nStory: 9 out of 10\nThe story in Assassin's Creed is very captivating and fascinating, because it uses historical characters.  The main plot is that the history of religion as we know it's a lie and the people were manipulated using advanced technology to believe certain facts. The action in the game takes place in september 2012 (5 years after the game was launched in 2007) and the main protagonist is Desmond, who is forced to relive the memories of his ancestor Altair using a machine called the Animus, by an umbrella corporation ABSTERGO, in order to find some lost artifacts. The memories of Altair are from the year 1191 during the Crusades and it involves the Templars and the Assassins, templars found the truth and wanted to use the advanced object to control the population and make order in the world, while the assassins  think that peace should be attained by choice and not imposed, and they will try to stop them.  While the idea of the story is very good, the way is told, isn't very clear and by the end of the game you'll have more questions than answers. Also at the end of the game you'll be able to see some cryptic messages and images, for which I strongly advise to search explanation on the internet, because they are very  interesting. Overall I will give a good score for the story, mostly because of it's original idea.\n\nGraphics: 9 out of 10\nThe graphics in this game are good, not exceptional but good. I really liked how the lighting was done and the design of each city. There are of course flaws and multiple glitches and some details are poorly done (like certain trees or the water), this is why I cannot give the maximum score. Does the graphics really deserve a 9? Some of you might disagree, but the high score is because of a personal preference for the time period, and not from a technical point of view.\n\nGameplay: 6.5 out of 10\nYes, even if the gameplay was cool for 2007 and was considered innovative by many, for me it wasn't the case. The jump system and moves were similar to another good game: Prince of Persia, with a lot of improvements, of course. So why a medium score? Well, first because the majority of the investigations and missions are repetitive as hell which becomes boring after the third time you do them, because the AI follows predefined paths, because the assassinations are almost always the same: I'm refering only to the options to kill your target, not the cutscenes (so the investigations become even more pointless, since the outcome is always the same), because the fighting is very simple and you can rarely die in this game (I've played the game with no HUD interface at all: no sync bar, gps etc. and died just a few times in combat and that because I was rushing  to kill my enemies), because most of the characters have no personality, because of no unique abilities for the enemy targets etc. After all this list of bugs/errors, you probably wonder why I gave it a 6 and not a 2, I guess because it's fun, the game is really casual and I've did all the repetitive investigations for the story details, which is a very good story.\nAudio: 8.5 out of 10\nThe audio is good, but I would have prefered to hear more diverse soundtracks, especially during combat.\nAI Behavior: 7 out of 10\nThe AI is bad, repetitive and sometimes glitchy. The high score is not because of the fighting system or the guards, it's because of the people inside the cities and the horses, which move realistic. I really liked to see this type of behavior, the crowd has a very good collision system and that makes cities feel alive. I can only appreciate this type of work done by the programmers, but I cannot say the same about the fighting which is repetitive and easy, with just 2 combinations you can defeat dozens of enemies, the only challenge that you'll have when facing AI enemies is numbers, not quality. The are a lot of funny situations where the AI behaves like a complete idiot, for example: not seeing that you jump right in front of them in a pile of hay , or not seeing that you just killed one of their friends a few meters from them (I'm not talking about stealth kill here, I'm talking about the stupid soldiers that don't react when there is a fight a few meters from them - I mean Ubisoft could have increased their detection range when the combat music starts, so that every soldier nearby can come and help his comrades), falling like idiots from buildings ( just try and make 10 soldiers or more follow you on a cliff or a tall building in the Kingdom area, and then do a ledge grab: you'll notice that the idiots cannot attack you and they will start to push each other off the building and die, until only 3-4 remain) etc. The AI needs a lot of work in the next sequels.\nMultiplayer: none\nOverall: 8 out 10\nThis is a good game, the great things about this game are it's story, the graphics and the main character Altair. The bad things, well the main bad things are enemy AI and the repetitive missions, I can pardon Ubisoft for a weak AI, since the game, overall is well made, but I don't like the fact that they were very lazy in designing the investigations, I mean on the Xbox and Playstation, they are just 4 investigation types that repeat 5-6 times, and on the PC they added just 2 more which also repeat 5-6 times throught the game. They could have added small details, like names for each character that gives you a mission, or more interesting side assassinations etc. , details that will remove a bit from the feeling of repeating the same activity over and over again in each district, in each city. They left the investigations to be done at random but in the memory block they put a specific order, I didn't liked this stuff, since  you either give me full free choice or you make it linear (I don't like doing an investigation and then seing that it was actually the 4th one in the memory block and that I should have done 3 others before it). I recommend buying the game, especially now that it costs less than 10 EUR, I paid less than 2.5 EUR during a sale on steam, but be warned that the end leaves many things unanswered, so you'll want to buy the sequel and the one after it, etc.  I will start doing the sequel now, I'll be back with the next review.", "hours": 39.4, "user_id": "76561198098975009", "username": "Dragos", "products": 119, "early_access": false}

There are hundreds of them all over the places we visit, the good thing is we are not forced to collect them, but still manages to distract me, this is because they appear in every AC game!

It is, of all the Assassin's Creed games, the most unpolished, glitchy and baldly unplayable. Considering most of the other games are rather mediocre, and that this is the worst of them, this praise, again, astounds me.\nI have heard praises heaped upon this game for it's narrative, for it's gameplay mechanics, and for it's primary protagonist. All 3 of these points fall flat when put to scrutiny.\nLet us look first at the narrative. I will spoil it, though for such a inane and so ideologically uninteresting of a story, one could hardly spoil it. The structure of the narrative revolves around a process of reclaiming your character's honor and position within the Assassin Order after they disgraced themselves by betraying the creed's 3 tenets.\nTo this end, you eliminate 9 targets, learning of a templar conspiracy. As you take them out, the assassin versus templar conflict becomes clear. Both the assassins and templars are secular humanists, so to speak. They both recognize religion, God, spiritual belief, philosophy, morality, and universal truths to be illusions manufactured by man.\nTheir difference is in the conclusions they come to from this recognition. The assassins seem to advocate liberty, that they would dispel the illusions, that they trust humanity with this. They think human nature good enough to find it's own truths without the illusions. So, freedom is their ideal.\nThe templars would not dispel the illusion, fearing the chaos that would come from it. They would maintain the illusion that they might maintain order. In fact, they would strengthen the existing hierarchies, religions, and authorities so they might further build an order to which all men serve. A new world order.\nThere's some sci-fi garbage somewhere in there revolving around a race who came before and how they or their artifacts manufactured all the various miracles and religious events throughout history. Whatever, it's abysmal at best.\nIt comes to pass that the templars you are eliminating are part of the same order as the assassin's mentor, Al Mualim, is also a templar, and was using you to kill the other leaders of the order so he would be free of any obligation to share power.\nThis is the same narrative twist we see used in a couple other, hugely superior games. In Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, a long chain of side quests where you work for elite bounty hunters known as the genoharadan -- the same form of twist is used. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the Dark Brotherhood questline concludes with a series of contracts that ends in a similar twist as well.\nThe conclusion we should make here is simply that the same sort of narrative has been told before with more interesting characters, conflicts, moral questions, and acceptable gameplay mechanics -- all things Assassin's Creed lacks.\nAs for the main protagonist, let us discuss the glorious, nuanced character of Altair that receives so much praise. Great lines of dialogue delivered in a monotone, flat, American accent -- Altair is, one would infer, Middle-Eastern. Seriously just listen to some of the lines he delivers, the voice acting is hilariously terrible. The character in the beginning so obviously set up for an arrogant-character-is-humbled-and-has-to-rediscover-honor-and-self cliche it's unbearable waiting for it to happen.\nThe gameplay mechanics are the most unnacceptable features of the game. Combat is slow, awkward and frustrating. Climbing and physics are beyond stupid. Gravity in the 1st game works like this: jump off building, fall normally for 10 feet or so, stop completely midair and resume falling but instead straight down, no matter the trajectory you had originally.\nMissions structure is the same literally every time. Do around 3 investigations upon entering a city, consisting of folllowing someone and beating them up, eavesdropping, or doing race or assassination minigames. This is supposedly to gather information on your target. In practice it seems useless, as every assassination seems a wholly scripted event, the investigations just repetitive and unneeded hoops/filler the game forces the player through to advance the shoddy story.\nGlitches are, of course, prominent and further make the game a frustrating and difficult experience to push through.\nPlease don't play this game.

(tl;dr at bottom)\nWhile that might not be exactly a breathtaking score, you will get 20-30 hours of gameplay out of this bad boy if you take your time and allow yourself to be immersed into the world, which I think makes it worth the price tag. When it first came out, everybody in the right mind knew that this was a good first step for Ubisoft's new IP. I owned the Platinum Edition of the game on Xbox 360 (which had fixed almost all the bugs and glitches) and I must say that it is easily one of my favorite single-player games of all time. Collected every flag, slayed every Templar, and unlocked every achievement. So to play it again on PC was nostalgic to say the least.\n-Pros-\n1. A rich and immersive story that has never been done before. That is, if you can look past the repetitive nature through which it is told (more on that later). You can see a lot of things being set-up, and with the help of the setting it takes place in, you might just find yourself doing what I did. Which was looking up stuff about the real life Hashashin and Templar Order, and researching the Crusades and places within the game, which they did a stunning job of recreating, especially for when the game came out. Their alternate take on history is crazy-cool, but the only way to truly do it justice is by playing it for yourself.\n2. Stealth works quite well, although it is significantly improved upon in later editions of the series. Blending in with the masses or groups of scholars fits and is quite seamless. As things progress the city guards are on higher alert, and you'll notice more of them on the streets, and also that there are more elite guards on the look out for the infidel. They provide a fair challenge until you get a grip of the combat (which is fairly basic), and that's good because Altair is supposed to be a total badass anyway, and a master swordsman. This allows for three primary different playstyles: stealth, open combat, or a mixture of those two.\n3. Another major thing to mention is the climbing works well. It is what gave that magical feel to this game when you play it for the first time. An open world where I can scale buildings and run through the streets of these beautifully crafted locales using parkour? Honestly made me want to go do it in real life. And some people did, just check YouTube! This is another mechanic that was trademark of the AC series, and only got better for the most part with each new installment. For its time though the system was awe inspiring, and fit the nature of the game perfectly, allowing you to truly bring out your inner assassin.\n-Cons-\n1. I won't spoil anything actually important, or something that would ruin the story. The story and lore is great. But the gameplay that tells it... repetitive. For me, a kid who played Mercenary: Playground of Destruction several times over, this wasn't much of a problem. It was easy to look past this and appreciate it from an artistic standpoint. Still, it must be mentioned, and if you ask anybody, this is probably one of the biggest gripes on Assassin's Creed I.\n2. While the Director's Cut and Platinum editions fixed a lot of stuff, the game can still be buggy as hell. I *DO NOT*... repeat, do not recommend this game if it is not compatible with your PC. Like me, you'll run into occasional crashes (the game has a great autosave system though), outright unobtainable and missing flags or Templars if you want to 100% the game like I did on the 360, and simply hilarious! glitches with guards dead bodies and even Altair. Annoyingly, sometimes when performing a Leap of Faith, he'll go through the entire animation and everything only to oddly bounce off the haybale at the bottom, sometimes resulting in your death. A fix can be found on YouTube / with a Google search.\n3. The game is not keyboard friendly at all. In fact, the controls aren't even described in-game for mouse and keyboard, saying things like \"Press the Head button to use Eagle Vision\" but you'll be screwing around for minutes trying to figure it out. I recommend a controller. However, this also has issues setting it up. Majority of people, including myself, had to do a quick internet search, download a patch to get the game to recognize the Xbox 360 PC controller properly. Even still, keyboard and mouse with the Assassin's Creed games just feels awkward and wrong. I recommend a controller, and spend the ~10-15 minutes fixing it if needed + learning the controls of the game. At least if you learn them now, you'll basically know how to play the rest of the series.\n4. The graphics did not quite withstand the test of time, but you shouldn't go into this game expecting anything like that. They were awesome for 2007 as far as I'm concerned, and hopefully you can look past those kinds of vain things to appreciate what lies beneath the surface. They're not terrible or anything, but lacking by today's standards... although, again, don't know why you would bother with such unfair comparison.\n---\ntl;dr is if it is compatable with your PC, buy it. More than likely, your computer will be 'too good to play the game'. Of course, if you don't mind dealing with occasional glitches and bugs, most of which are humorous but might detract from the immersion, go for it anyway. Your call. The story is fantastic, and you should definitely pick it up if you want to play and understand the following installments. Worth the money with plenty of content and mild replayability, and a definite gem of 2007 despite its repetitious nature.", "hours": 28.4, "user_id": "76561197999684533", "username": "foxxx", "products": 108, "early_access": false}

However, once I started to play this game my opinion shifted and I realised why his franchise became huge.\nThe graphics were far ahead for its time as it was released in 2007 and even though there are an occaional glitch or two, they aren't majour-they are quite trivial and don't affect the gameplay. The story is a very good one as it focuses on a an assassin regaining his lost honour and title by assinating 9 templars and in doing so reveals much about corruption and deception. The character admitadly we don't see much of a development on as he is quite bland-I prefer Ezio overall as we see his development and maturity more- however, he adds a sense of \"coldness\" which i believe makes him more of an assassin. Even though I had feared that there would be a lot missing and would make the game simple compared to it's sequels, there were things that did make it much harder such as not being able to have a killstreak, calling other assassins, having air/ledge/hiding spot assination-which I think was the most difficult part or having a double blade which made the game more of achallenge and makes it more fun.\nOverall, if you are looking to see what began it all, don't mind how many things are missing from it since AC2 was a huge leap from AC1 and want more of an Assassin game where the objective is to assassinate multiple targts as the main plot then this game then this game is for you and you should get it since it is quite cheap!\nI would rate this game 8.5/10 for being a brilliant start to an awesome franchise!", "hours": 18.7, "user_id": "76561198096562654", "username": "Ideal-Dragon-101", "products": 159, "early_access": false}

It's English class and dictation time. You like English and welcome the challenge. So, you master this task and look forward to the next topic. But instead of changing the subject, the teacher forces you to write down the same text he or she has just dictated. Again. And again and again, the very same text, merely replacing a word here and there. Eight times, to be precise. That's Assassin's Creed.\nAs an assassin fallen from grace, you are given the mission to assassinate nine people in order to bring peace to the Holy Land. Each target sits somewhere in one of three large cities. In order to access missions vital for your task, you have to climb to the top of towers, churches and minarettes and get a view of your surroundings from there. If you are bored, you can rescue citizens from being terrorized by city guards. The actual missions to unlock the target are eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. Once you completed enough of these critical missions, you move in and kill the target. The actual assassination is the only part with a bit of variety. The rest is. Exactly. The. Same. Nine times. This is where AC transcends ist existence as a game and becomes something a game should never, ever be: A chore.\nIf you are REALLY bored, you can spend your time finding hidden flags and assassination target, which reward you with more energy bars. BUT: You can get all bars by climbing the view spots and saving the citizens, all things which are marked on your map. So, unless there's some super-secret unlockable I've never heard of, you have zero reasons to do these sidequests. Oh, sure, you get your XBox 360 achievements for them, so if you're after them, feel free to -Wait.\nThere are good and worthwhile things in Assassin's Creed. The atmosphere is nice, if a bit cold. The cities are well-realized. The animation of your player character is nothing short of spectacular, even now. The freerunning is great fun... and honestly the only thing that made see this one through. Now, I haven't played the second part yet, but from what I've heard, it's supposed to be far superior.

The characters are almost none existent and the story seems to have trouble developing itself, most notably towards the end of the game where the story just collapes in on itself and doesn't make sense anymore, leaving on an ending that leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth.  The story does have a few twists and turns you won't you see coming and they can be very suspenseful, but none of them last and are only small moments that shine.  As a whole, the story is unsatisfying and leaves much to be desired.\nGameplay\nNow, the gameplay as a whole isn't exactly bad.  In fact, it can be quite good.  For example, combat can be fun and satisfying and the free-run system is equally satifying.  However, the game mechanics work 90% of the time, but the other 10% it doesn't work makes the game infuriating.  The 10% is most notable whenever you are running away from guards, and Altair decides to have a panic attack and jump to whatever platform he feels like, coating himself with gorilla glue in the process, in order to stick to every pixel possible at the worst times.  It can be very difficult to control Altair during this instances and leads to possibly broken monitors.  As a whole, gameplay can be fun, but usually results in frustration due to annoying controls and error in game mechanics.\nThe Good\nStory\nThe only good that comes from the story is the unexpected twists and turns.

I played a few hours of it, only to walk away annoyed and disappointed. Recently however, when the majority of the Assassin's Creed franchise was on sale for less than $5 a game, I decided to give it another try. That was one of the best decisions I've made in gaming and I've been hooked ever since.\nThe true historical applications of the game, albeit slighty modified, is intriguing, educational, and very well-done. I felt as though I really was fighting an oppressive force during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191. This game takes advantage of historical events, locations, and terminology in the same way the Metal Gear series does. The ancestoral concept throughout the game was like nothing I've ever seen in a game and brought a uniqueness to it. The protagonist, Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, is a competent fighter and agile acrobat. The growth of character witnessed during the course of the game was satisfying and gave you a clearer understanding of what the creed means.\nOn the other hand, the tasks were a little repetitive and stealth wasn't very prevalant. You had very few ways to sneak up on someone and would rather kill someone then have to run away each time.

Launched in 2007, the game received enormous commercial success on consoles, but only a year later after its initial release, Assassin\u2019s Creed was introduced to PC. Assassin\u2019s Creed is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy lands of; Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus during the Crusades.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed is a beautiful game, every crack and crevasse is filled with amazing detail, from astounding visuals to overheard cries for help. The graphics are absolutely jaw dropping, despite the age of the game. The Vast cities of Jerusalem and Acre extend into the horizon with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people living out their daily lives. All the while the frame-rate remains constant.\nThe story, or should I story\u2019s, brings the game to life. On the one hand, you play an assassin during the Third Crusade in 1191 AD, named Altair. We follow his quests as he assassinates nine public figures at the command of his master. And on the other hand, you are put into the shoes of Desmond Miles, whose ancestor was Altair. Desmond was taken in by a mysterious organization for questioning, and put into the Animus. The Animus is a device which allows the user to revisit their ancestors\u2019 past memories. Desmond is forced to relive his ancestor\u2019s life against his will for unknown reasons.\nThe voice acting is solid throughout the game. Conversations are completely believable and delivered with the perfect amount of solemn dignity. What you hear in the game is more impressive than what you see. In the cities with populated areas, your ears will fill with the pleas of beggars, the din of street vendors, and the occasional humming. At the top of synchronisation points, you hear the wind blowing past you as you climb for the sky, the barking of a far-off dog, and the twittering of birds.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed is exceptionally entertaining in that it features a mix of fine stealthy exploration and exciting combat. You start the game off fairly weak, but as you progress through missions, Altair gains new abilities and increased health. Before a primary target can be assassinated, you need to gather intelligence. The methods by which you go about doing so present the most irritating aspects of the game. When you get a mission to assassinate a target, you have to do at least 3 side quests first before you can assassinate the main target. There are an array of side quests that you can choose from, like; Pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interrogation, and target elimination. The problem is that after doing one of the side quests, there\u2019s practically nothing satisfying about it.\nAfter completing three side quests of any variety, you head over to an assassin\u2019s bureau in the city and you get informed that you can now assassinate your main target. The problem is that all the bits of intelligence you pick up while on side quests have little to no impact on how the eventual primary target mission plays out. Beyond that problem, after repeating the process for each target, things got plain, simple and just really boring.\nThe controls, for me, could have been better. I often found myself getting stuck on a wall, roof top or the side of a building as you can\u2019t just jump anywhere; you have to jump from one specific point to another. This really got on my nerves, especially when trying to run away from guards, the last thing you want to happen is to get stuck. Combat in the game is fun and exciting, but it does have its issues. First off, there are a few combinations that you will need time to get used to. Secondly, the character did not always do what I wanted him to. This did get a tad annoying sometimes but it\u2019s not a major issue.\nThe player is given five different weapons; long sword, short sword, throwing knives, and a hidden blade. Each weapon is useful in different situations. The long sword is the main tool of self-defence, and is useful for big battles; the short sword is a light and fast blade which is useful when facing small numbers of enemies; throwing knives can be very useful as they kill the enemy instantly, and you can use them for long distance kills; and the hidden blade which is used for assassinations.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed does come with a few issues that just can\u2019t be ignored. Firstly, the amount of guards that walk around the roof tops is incredible. It is impossible to go anywhere by running \u2018freely\u2019 on the roof tops without alerting a guard. You can assassinate them, but after a while, that satisfaction of watching Altair use his hidden blade to slam down a guard just becomes boring and you just want to get to where ever you going. So then you decide to take the city streets to your destination, only to find out that it\u2019s just as annoying as taking the roof tops. The city streets in Assassin\u2019s Creed are plagued with beggars, drunken people and woman carrying pots on their heads that fall and break if you run into them.\nIf you are on a stealth mission where keeping your distance or blending in is needed, just wait until you come across the beggars who run in front of you, and you only, and start asking for money, meanwhile your target is getting away as once the beggar is in front of you it\u2019s hard to get them out of the way. Same scenario, but you are confronted with drunken people who walk around and look like zombies from 'Land Of The Dead', if you get close to them they will push you which ultimately gives away your position and you have to restart the mission.\nThe Verdict:\nAssassin\u2019s Creed is definitely not the best game in the series, with its repetitive side quests and annoying NPCs, the game can get a bit frustrating and boring. For somebody totally unfamiliar with the game, it's certainly worth playing. Even though the game does have its faults, it still offers a great mix of exploration and action that is just waiting to be experienced.\n+ Good graphics\n+ Lots to explore\n+ Great story\n+ Challenging missions\n- No side Quests\n- Controls could have been better\n- To many guards on the roof tops\n- To many beggars and drunk people in the cities\nSCORE: 7.5/10", "hours": 20.8, "username": "ZS-KEV", "products": 168, "early_access": false}

See Conclusion\nNote: This being the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.\nINTRODUCTION:\nAssassin's Creed is the first title of the popular Ubisoft Franchise of the same name. It is a semi-sandbox, action-adventure-stealth game set in the Holy Lands during the medieval period, more specifically, during the Crusades. It was originally released for the consoles back in 2007 with a PC release the following year.\nThe game places you in the shoes of Desmond Miles who, using a machine called the Animus, accesses the genetic memory of his ancestor Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad in an attempt to retrace a series of events that would lead him to an unknown artifact called \u201cPiece of Eden\u201d. Journey across the war torn Holy Lands and watch history unfold as every action Alta\u00efr makes, unravels another piece of a greater mystery and conspiracy that stretches across several generations.\nPROS:\n+ Good Storytelling with a refreshing mix of historical, and sci-fi elements.\n+ Good combat, stealth and core gameplay mechanic\n+ Graphically beautiful despite its age at the time of this review\n+ World and level design are well done\n+ Beautiful atmospheric surroundings\n+ Lots of NPCs which make the Holy Land feel alive and immersive\n+ Interesting and memorable characters\n+ Good sound design and voice acting\n+ Top notch animation quality\n+ Large semi-non-linear map to explore\n+ Target assassinations can be completed in several ways\n+ No Uplay account requirement\nCONS:\n- Combat becomes repetitive\n- Counter-attack can be seriously abused\n- Not much to do outside the Animus (while you're Desmond Miles)\n- Useless and unrewarding collectibles which results in...(see next con)\n- Not much incentive to explore the vast game world\n- No progression system to speak of (not a lot of upgrades or weapon variation)\n- Master Assassin Alta\u00efr cannot swim (living in the desert is not an excuse)\n- Lepers and Beggars\nCONCLUSION:\nAssassin's Creed is a good game with a very interesting story which mixes together historical background and sci-fi elements. It has a vast atmospheric world and together with the beautiful graphics and sound design, makes for an enjoyable experience. I kinda wish they had more rewarding side missions though. Combat is fun, stealth is satisfying and the core mechanic, although it can feel repetitive at times, rarely gets boring.\nOverall its GOOD and a GOOD BUY. As it stands, buying the game at full price is not bad but since the game goes on sale frequently, I suggest waiting. It's a good game to have in your library as a collector's item if anything else.\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

And with hordes of enemies on every corner, it's really a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nGameplay: basically, it's the same pattern throughout the game: find the assassins' bureau, perform at least minimum number of investigations, kill the primary target, report of success. What changes is the city/city district and number of soldiers in the cities. By the end of the game, the numbers are overwhelming. There's really no way how you stay incognito, unless you are tiptoing through vast quarters full of beggars, thugs and crazy people, that all stand in your way to perform missions. What I hated the most was that there's really no way you could STEALTH kill the targets, because they were surrounded by number of guards. And that number was increasing with each next target. It felt more like hack'n'slash at some points.\nSide missions:\nclimb points of view - reveals the location of assassins' bureaus and other side missions;\nsave citizens - reduces number of soldiers and unlock vigilantes that might help you escape (it's not that much of a help actually);\ninvestigations: eavesdropping, pickpocketing, intimidation missions, escort challenges, killing archers/pursuers for fellow assassins, flag challenges/catching informers on time;\ncollectibles: flags (a set for each city/territory).\nWith every completed set of 15 objectives, you are granted additional health unit, but after you're maxed out, there's no point to bother with side missions, because they're all the same and do not provide any substantial reward.\nI have previously played AC3 and I think it's a wonderful game.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 156, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-11-02", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed is an undeniably ambitious game. Attempting to follow in the storied tradition of greats such as chocolate and peanut butter, it wants to be a bunch of awesome things made even more awesome by way of combination\u2014specifically, equal parts tense stealth game, badass fighting game, and open-world sandbox game rolled into one. It even wants to deliver a complicated plot that will keep you guessing to the very end. The result is sort of like dumping your chocolate and peanut butter into a bowl of ice cream along with every other item from the make-your-own-sundae bar. The mixture as a whole is a little odd, but once you learn to identify the things you like and pick around the things you don\u2019t there are some incredible taste sensations to be had.\nDespite taking place during the Third Crusade in the embattled Holy Land surrounding Jerusalem, Assassin\u2019s Creed barely touches upon religious issues and instead focuses more on general issues of power over society. You play an assassin named Altair (pronounced Al-Taa-Ir) who is tasked with the killing of nine influential men\u2014including both Christians and Muslims\u2014towards the greater goal of restoring order to the land and bringing justice to the people. There is also another element to the story, a sci-fi bit that may not be to some people\u2019s liking. Although it does permeate the HUD and other parts of the graphical interface it only surfaces directly as very brief interludes a few times during the game, and the story as a whole remains interesting enough to drive the action forward.\nThat action revolves around the nine assassinations, and each one follows the same basic formula. You go to the city district your current target resides in (three districts in each of three cities), find out where and what your target is up to, and then take him out. There are investigation mini-games\u2014eavesdropping, pick-pocketing, interrogation, and other forms of information gathering\u2014which you must completed to move on, as well as lookout points to climb and citizens to rescue from the guards, optional tasks encouraged by the increase to your maximum health and additional means of escape from the guards they grant. The assassinations themselves often come down to a scripted sequence followed by a brief stalking or a brawl and a large dose of the plot. Though not entirely unsatisfying, those hoping for more of a Hitman-esque arena to set up your own style of assassination will be disappointed.\nTo accomplish all this you\u2019ll rely on Altair\u2019s three rather impressive skills sets\u2014fighting, sneaking, and acrobatics. Fighting, while it looks amazing with tons of cinematic flourishes and gruesome finishing moves, basically comes down to a one-button timing game. Repeatedly press the attack button with the right timing and you\u2019ll score a kill. Likewise, the proper timing on that same button while blocking will score you a counter strike, either sending your foe sprawling or killing him outright. Mess it up and you\u2019re likely to take some damage. There are a few other wrinkles, but that\u2019s pretty much it. Your enemies always have swords, and come in maybe three or four different difficulties, but once you master the system no number of enemies is ever really hard again.\nWhen you don\u2019t feel like fighting, or in rare instances when it\u2019s actually required, Altair\u2019s stealth abilities come in handy. Assassin\u2019s Creed doesn\u2019t use typical stealth mechanics though, but rather the concept of hiding as its mainstay. When the guards aren\u2019t alerted, you can hide in plain sight, by moving slowly and blending into crowds. In this state you can assassinate even the toughest enemies in the game with a strike from your hidden blade. Once the charade is up though, you\u2019ll have to run to one of many pre-set hiding points\u2014piles of hay, small cloth-draped gazebos, etc.\u2014or kill all the guards chasing you before you can go back to being sneaky again. It\u2019s a little hokey, but it more or less functions as intended, leading to some tense moments and harrowing chases.\nOne of the real highlights of Assassin\u2019s Creed is Altair\u2019s incredible acrobatic abilities. Taking a page from the Price of Persia\u2019s playbook, Altair is a master of all things running and jumping. Anything and everything is a potential hand or foot hold, and scaling city structures using the seamless controls is not only a joy but one that nets very tangible strategic rewards. It also gives you an opportunity, particularly when climbing the many lookout points, to gape in awe at exactly how beautiful Assassin\u2019s Creed is, arguably featuring the best art direction ever in a game. The cities and surrounding landscape are fantastically presented, and the panoramic views from high above are truly breathtaking.\nThrough the first third of the game, which amounts to a greatly extended tutorial, you are shown all of these wonderful things you can do. What happens after that is a very subtle escalation of the difficulty that continues through the rest of the game. Hacking through guards too easy? How about larger and larger groups then, with better countering abilities and trickier timings? Sneaking around too easy? Try getting past more guards on higher alert who will spot you if you\u2019re careless. Likewise, later city districts have trickier buildings to climb, with more archers positioned on the roofs. It\u2019s a very clever and refined way to make a game, but the subtlety is at times too slight, and there is a great repetition of the same basic elements for most of the game with little in the way of overt addition.\nIncredibly stylish and undeniably unique, Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2019s particular choices in combining all these gameplay elements will be debated by supporters and critics alike for a long time. If it all sounds like too much to realistically fit into one game, at least in this case it is, but not by as wide a margin as you might imagine. The result, while not quite all it could have been, is definitely more than the sum of its parts. While Assassin\u2019s Creed doesn\u2019t manage to deliver a top notch experience in any one of these areas individually, it gets enough things right in all of them and gives you a lot of freedom in how to use them, all while looking pretty damn cool. Though it degenerates into a lot of fighting at the end, and makes a fair number of mistakes in its execution along the way, there\u2019s something entrancing about this game and each of the amazing things you can do. Your mileage may vary on precisely how quickly the game\u2019s repetition exceeds its subtle nuance, but it\u2019s well worth checking out for the first times if not for the seventy thirds.", "hours": 18.8, "username": "Nerd House", "products": 3362, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 156, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-11-02", "text": "The original.\nGreat story, the element of past vs. present and the ever-present mystery and suspense is almost overhelming. A definite favourite of mine at any rate.\nThis game got me into the Assassin's creed franchise. The gameplay may not be the very best there is, but it's good. The \"side missions\" are the same in every city and every district, which is at times boring. However, the whole story and the actual main missions are all worth this.\nThe free-running aspect of the gameplay is of course the main pull. Even at this stage it's already great fun to run along the rooftops, though it gets considerably better in the later games.\nThe weapons are few, but it's enough for this game. The hidden blade and the sword are all you need most of the time, anyway.\nMy favourite part are the little \"stories\" told during the death scenes. The dialogue is well written and it makes you think and question and doutb much like it does the main character. The plot is the driving force of this games at any rate, because the mystery and the power are something to be revealed, something to be discovered.\nThe combat is fairly easy, once you get the hang of it. As you acquire new skills and techniques, you grow bolder in combat, no longer waiting for the opportunity to counter, but to attack as well. The aspect of growth is important as the game progresses and as the character changes. First, you get to try out all the things you have, all that you can do, but you do not know how to do or use most of those things. Then, they are ripped away from you and you're left with only the bare necessities. You learn as the characters does, to use the little you have and to deserve more.\nThe cities are different in architecture, all magnificent, although the details are not all that sharp. However, this is the first game and if played first, it will pull you in. It's set where most other games never set foot, therefore compelling.\nThe educational side is great. The characters presented in the games, mostly \"villains\", are based, in many cases, on real history-related people. There's so much to learn and so much passion to ignite while having fun at the same time.\nOne major downside is the lack of subtitles. For someone such as myself, who is not a native speaker, it is hard to understand the dialogue at times, which is a pity since it's so well written. Also, the hearing impaired gamers are sure to feel left out, because they cannot enjoy this piece as well as they could were the subtitles there.\nDespite the fact that the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, apart from the main missions, it is still revolutionary. You're allowed to run and be free for as long as you wish. The combat is fun, because winning usually is - saving poor people is a bonus and you feel like a hero for a while, though the story and the other characters don't see you as such. But as the story grows, so does the character and this is one of the few games where the main character learns, grows and changes. The Altair you start out with and the one you are at the end are not the same and the difference is palpable. The game holds a potential for greatness only developed and fully discovered in the later games. It makes for an enjoyable 20-hour ride nonetheless.\n7/10", "hours": 27.9, "user_id": "76561198133287006", "username": "cheerie", "products": 86, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 156, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-11-01", "text": "Initially published by Ubisoft in 2007, Assassin\u2019s Creed is the under-appreciated foundation of the critically acclaimed franchise. It is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. While this fluid and beautiful game is often the victim of mixed reviews by fans, it serves a very important purpose. The first time I tried this game, I put it down as a result of becoming bored too quickly, but this game is worth investing in. That is, if you have taken a shine to any of its sequels. It is my strong and undying opinion that you\u2019d be doing the developers a great disservice by skipping the heart of the best selling series. While the later games are more entertaining and hold more appeal, one needs to play Assassin\u2019s Creed in order to truly understand the elaborate groundwork laid out for its successors.\nThe game focuses on the use of an immersive computer system known as the \u201cAnimus\u201d, and its latest subject called Desmond Miles. While Desmond may appear to be an average bartender from an average world, he is actually a descendant of the legendary Assassin Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u2019Ahad. Through the Animus, the player will bear witness to the genetic memories of Desmond\u2019s ancestor, and the events between two secret societies as they unfold during the Third Crusade.\nOverall, I felt that the story was weak, but it took some revolutionary steps towards creating a solid foundation for a marvelous series of sequels. While the story might initially seem confusing as the player nears the end, it is surprisingly well thought out, so give it a chance.\nAs stated previously, much of the game is disclosed through the eyes of Desmond Miles as he relives the memories of Alta\u00efr through the Animus. Inside the Animus, the player will be introduced to a computerized interface displaying all of the mandatory information varying from health to inventory, and a third person view of Alta\u00efr.\nIt is important for anyone unfamiliar with the franchise to be aware that Alta\u00efr moves in real time opposed to turn-based. The  movement in the game is possibly its most notable feature which permits the player to scale buildings, catch ledges, jump over gaps, and more. Assassin\u2019s Creed has a love for utilizing a diverse set of active (high profile) and passive (low profile) approaches, so if you manage to draw unwanted attention to yourself, you\u2019re probably going to need to find a haystack - fast - unless you feel like fighting a band of poor unfortunate souls (otherwise known as guards).\nUnfortunately, even with easy access to multiple weapon sets and various combat skills, the gameplay of Assassin\u2019s Creed can only be described as repetitive. The game makes a habit of recycling the same formula for most of the key assassinations, which becomes tedious. Despite that, it\u2019s still worth buying - If this is too repetitive, simply rush through this game. There is a lot more to do in its successors, and the developers improve the ability to enjoy the tasks in the future. However, as I stated, skipping the groundwork does the entire franchise a bit of a disservice.\nFurthermore, as Alta\u00efr the player will also need to familiarize themselves with the art of synchronization. Synchronization is measured by the Animus as Desmond follows his genetic memories, and reflects its user\u2019s faithfulness to the memory in question. In other words, is Desmond re-living the memory as it was, or has he diverted from its path? Straying too far from the objective will result in a loss of synchronization, which will result in forcing the user to start over from an earlier point. Needless to say, not \u201ceverything is permitted\u201d.\nFinally, the last aspect that I really feel called to touch on is Eagle Vision. In short, Eagle Vision is a seemingly dormant sixth sense in most humans, however it manages to aid Alta\u00efr in his tasks throughout the game. Utilized, this ability will help the player to locate targets, gauge intentions of others, and ultimately seek out his mark. I found this aspect to be fairly interesting, and hope you enjoy using this ability as much as I did.\nThe controls of Assassin\u2019s Creed are extremely friendly. I used my 360 controller, and the game provided me with excellent controller support. However, I did try to play the game with the mouse and keyboard setup, and I cannot recommend this to anyone. This game is best played with a controller.\nIn general, the targeting is a bit tricky, but that is something you can work around.\nAs I stated at the beginning of the review, I tried playing Assassin\u2019s Creed once before. What I failed to mention was that my first attempt was on the XBOX 360 years ago. On the 360, the game looked polished and pretty. However, it\u2019s original appeal has nothing on the dreamlike quality of the graphics on the PC. I could hardly believe that the game was originally released in 2007 when I first booted it up. Sure, there are some technical glitches here and there, but the PC version has definitely left a deeper impression.\nI feel like it is an understatement to report that the views in Assassin\u2019s Creed are breathtaking. In fact, they are polished, atmospheric, realistic, and lifelike. It is absolutely fascinating to me how well Ubisoft managed to present the world in this game.\nIn Assassin\u2019s Creed, you will come to hate that one stupid beggar that manages to find you in every single town, who just absolutely has to tell you \u201cMy family is sick and dying\u201d... What I\u2019m really trying to say, is that the continuously recycled voice tracks are just as repetitive as the gameplay itself. If it doesn\u2019t annoy you, I envy you your patience. With a bit more polishing (and perhaps a few more lines recorded by their voice actors) the NPCs could have been a much enjoyable thing to encounter.\nOn a positive note, the music is gorgeous.\nOverall the sounds of Assassin\u2019s Creed are realistic and immersive, fitting for a game that places a heavy focus on its atmosphere.\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d play it again, unless I wanted a refresher of the story, but it is definitely worth at least one playthrough. As always, the replay value is entirely dependent on the individual holding the controller, and I can see a great deal of replay potential in this game. While the story is questionably weak, there are a lot of remaining individual elements to explore and to enjoy - Particularly if you enjoy exploration and immersive combat.", "hours": 28.5, "username": "Foreverlore", "products": 148, "early_access": false}

Assassin's Creed is an enthralling, original game about old historical events, with a twist. In this game, you play as Desmond, an assassin in a clan of assassins, and your goal is to go into the past and discover who you are by observing your ancestors through the \"Animus\" as they participated in key historical events. The ancestor whose life you venture though in this game is Altair.\nWhat I really like about this game is all the history you can learn from it. This game has an entirely fictional story with an accurate, non-fictional, historical environment. Many of the locations you visit in this game are similar (obviously not exact) to their real life counter parts during the time period the game takes place in. There are also real buildings and people that were recreated in this game, and when you encounter them the game tells you some of the history behind them. Also, the parkour in this game is unique and more complex than that of any other game that came before it. It provides very fun gameplay and plays a major role in the game's story.\nWhat I dislike about this game is the side missions. They are all more like challenges and have practically no side story to them (that was probably intentional, but I still felt like they should have had some sort of side story). I think with something interesting to do in this game other than the main story missions, the game could have been a little better. That doesn't include the game's underlying story with Desmond, which I actually also found entertaining.\nIf you love parkour, stealth, and/or a 1100 A.D. theme, this is the game for you.

Relatively repetitive, little replay value. Good starting point into AC Universe, but with no multiplayer or branching story, and little in the way of customization, there is no need to replay the game unless one is looking for deeper meaning in the story. The more recent AC games have also perfected the formula.\n8/10\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\nAs the introduction to a now well known and defined franchise by Ubisoft {France and other studios}, Assassin's Creed\u2122 is the cornerstone entry into now what has become Ubisoft's flagship brand.\nAssassin's Creed\u2122: Director's Cut is the quintessential version of that cornerstone. Ultimately, the game is fun to play to an extent. For those lost in the annals of the Assassin's Creed universe, this game is a great stepping stone to move into the now popular \"revenge, passion, and growth\" storylines that permeate the modern AC entries. For fans of Ubisoft's work, it can serve as an interesting look back at the mechanics and storytelling that launched a new IP.\nHowever, I would like to stress that this game is not like its future bretheren. The game has little in the way of customization of either character or playstyle. The unlocks are given at defined intervals and there is significant travel time between mission sets. The gameplay is repetitive, taking place through a variety of event types that ultimately lead you up to an extended mission with a difficult situation to overcome tactically. However there is no replay value, as the missions do not change. The graphics are dated 7 years later, and the Director's Cut content does not add anything that changes the way the mission sets play out.\nI do want to note that the game places much of stress onto players to approach situations how they want while being given the tools to do so. Two of the 6-8 side missions are required for the player to approach the set-ending assasination attempt, which leaves it to the player to decide how much preparation they want to place behind their precision. The future entries in the AC Universe certainly distill this methodology of player agency and expand on it, incorporating the side missions into the main story, therefore lengthening the story and making the work up to an assassination attempt significant in a different way.\nI would also like to stress that the story is different as well. The story for AC was developed following the loose adaptation of Vladimir Bartol's Alamut. The story is not the typified AC norm (emotionally scarring event that leads the protagonist into a catharsis, forging the character and leading to the emergence of an assassin moving to vanquish those who wronged him/her/the brotherhood) The Assassin v. Templar threat is not well fleshed out here in the meta-story either. However, these are tropes left to the rest of the franchise to carry out.\nI argue that this story line is the last one that has significant interpretation that can be administered. Although containing franchise staples such as revenge and freedom, the epiphany here takes the length of the game, and the true value is in the growth of the main character, not in the vanquishing of the main antagonist. The assassination's in the mean time serve as the vehicles that propel the character to the objective, without becoming the objectives themselves. It is here that the story shines, even though it is an adaptation of a story written in 1938.\nDespite it's flaws, Assassin's Creed\u2122 is a title that enthusiasts and beginners can both pick up and enjoy with the only draws being the repetitive nature of the mechanics. I love the game and certainly suggest it to all interested. With it's interesting and well written story, and fun gameplay with appropriate twists, this title earns and keeps it's place as the birthplace of AC and one of Ubisoft's riskier and profitible entries.\n8/10\n**It should be noted that Ubisoft took a financial hit in developing AC, losing a significant amount to a lack of sales driven by the release of this as a new IP and the lack of heavy marketing that Ubisoft now relies on. Ironically, the game's mechanics and models have been copied into many of Ubisoft's other IPs and has created an extremely successful franchise that is soon seeing it's next installments in AC: Unity and AC: Rogue, bringing the total number of console/PC AC properties to 8. Vladimir Bartol would be proud.**", "hours": 14.0, "username": "ThreeRangers", "products": 129, "early_access": false}

The fact that it takes 2 buttons and WASD to sprint really proves that. The whole high profile low profile aspect of the controls really make the entire thing feel really clunky. This also leaks over into the combat, which I love in concept, but in execution eventually becomes hold down RMB and then spam LMB after theyre done attacking, at least until you get countering. After that, the combat becomes even more of a joke. Parkour doesn't feel satisfying in the slightest, really all you have to do is press \"W\" and RMB and press space when you plateau. All of this gets really repetitive fast with a storyline that reflects 2 boring AAA movies forced together , a main character that almost borders on shadow the hedgehog levels of edge and sci-fi elements that are completely uncalled for.

It also nailed the basic open world action gameplay mechanic of combining primary objectives with optional side quests (batman), climbing towers to make nearby objectives appear on the map (farcry 3), and fluid hand to hand skirmishes that become more complex as the game progresses (batman).  AC nails these mechanics right out of the gate.\nThe meat of the game is exploration of the game world, set in the middle east some time during the crusades. There are 3 cities to explore, each with similar architecture but a distinctive feel.  The player can only access a few sections of the city initially, and more become available as the story progresses.  Being an assassin, the primary missions involve dealing death to some high profile victim in a specific city and section.  Secondary objectives are a mix of \"protect the citizen\", \"assasinate these minor dudes\", pickpocketing, evesdropping, and parkouring challenges.  There are also flags scattered around that you can pick up but there was little incentive to do so.\nStory sections and major missions feature a brief cinematic that is rendered in the game world.  Often you can switch to another camera position by clicking a button on the joystick.  The cinematic then seamlessly returns control to the player.\nThere is also an overarching \"meta story\" that is told from the perspective of a young man who is apparently a descendant of the assassin you are playing.  There is a device called the \"Animus\" that you lie opon... it then allows you to access and play out the memories from the past, and also influence (apparently) the original outcome.  I won't reveal anything else about that... you will need to discover that for yourself.\nAll is not perfect though there are some annoyances:\n> The gameplay is repetitive, with only minor variance as your level increases.  The \"boss battles\" tend to become more complex but the meat and potatoes are samey.\n> The cities have some differences but honestly if you plopped me in one city and asked me to correctly identify it, it would be difficult.  They don't feel different enough, adding to the samey-ness.\n> The textures and character models are a bit crude.  I would definitely recommend the hi res texture mod, which you can find on the steam forums.\n> This game was designed with an XBOX controller in mind... you will NOT want to use a mouse.  Not necessarily a huge annoyance but I for one prefer mouse and keyboard over joystick.\nAll in all I enjoyed the game immensely and would definitely recommend it.\n9/10", "hours": 12.9, "username": "CinderellaMan", "products": 769, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 165, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-09-15", "text": "The original Assassin's Creed game is what started a franchise that can be recognized almost anywhere. I honsetly believe it was this game that served as the catalyst to boost Ubisoft Montreal into creating the multiple other AC games.\nI wanted to include my own story overview, because in my opinion you'll want to play this game because of the gameplay (Parkour, Freerunning, Combat) first and the storyline second. This isn't because I thought the story was bad-- it is just the least interesting in the series. However this story was what started the Assassin's Creed lore and, well, Creed.\nYou start off by waking up inside a machine known as \"The Animus\", a device developed by a company called \"Abstergo\". To be more clear 'you' are Desmond Miles, a young man who claims to be a bartender. Abstergo kidnapped Desmond as a means to probe him with the Animus to recover memories of his ancestors, which would lead them to something (something of value) that was lost to time (as Assassin's Creed I is set during the Crusades, in 1191 AD). Once inside the Animus, you play as Altair, a master Assassin who loses everything he built up in the Brotherhood by breaking key Tenents set by the Order's leader, Al Maulim, and Assassins from a previous age. Abstergo follows the memories of Altair, searching for a device created by unknown people (speculated to be supernatural beings) that has the ability to control the minds of others. Towards the middle of the story Desmond realizes what is happening, that the company called Abstergo is actully run by Templar Knights, who are still bent on ending the war waged by Assassins and Templars, even after a thousand years, by using the Apple (as the mind-control device is called).\nSo does Desmond or Altair do something about it? You'll have to buy this game and play it to find out.\nBeyond Story, this game has very nice gameplay and graphics for a game made in 2007-2008. I can still consider it a Next Gen game, as the details and cinematics are very well done. This game isn't seamless, as you have to load every time you change locations-- thats another thing: While this game is tagged as \"Open World\", the game is devised to give you the first few levels complete control over where you go. After this, you can quickly travel between the main cities in the game; Masyaf, Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus. The area in between these places is called Kingdom on the map. You can always travel through Kingdom, but you always have the option to teleport to the cities' outskirts after you return to Al Maulim at Masyaf. This game, in this case, becomes both Open World, and Linear. But because this is a small detail, it doesn't really add up as a problem in-game.\nParkour is always fun in AC, as you can freerun up any place so long as there are handholds of ledges to hold onto. The game's \"Leap of Faith\" idea wasn't bad, but it makes the game seem unrealistic in my opinion, not that this game should sound \"real\" at all. Basically a Leap of Faith is when you climb up onto a veiwpoint, spy your surroundngs, then leap down into a nearby haystack. Its a very fun feature, but looks very impossible. Ignoring the aesthetics of the Leap of Faith, it's a great way to get players to explore without feeling rushed. You don't just walk around and unlock map bits. You have to climb up and look around to know where to go. This is also great because you don't complete missions if you don't explore-- you have to complete three side-quests before the target is avaliable to kill. So viewpoints and Leaps of Faith are very much-- gameplay wise-- critical.\nI've played Assassin's Creed through once now. It can go quick if you want it to, or rush through it to do the most important thing you can possibly do once you complete AC1-- play the next game.\nI give this game a 8/10, because its fun to play, but just ends too quickly!", "hours": 34.7, "username": "Litoo Blek Sebno", "products": 44, "early_access": false}

So I\nactually have to say that trying to get 100% in every memory is actually a\nwaste of time as it doesn't really add much value to your overall gameplay or\nyour understanding of the game world.\nWhat I absolutely don't like also is that you as a player can't really decide\nfor yourself how you want to accomplish a mission. I personally would much\nprefer to eliminate my targets without any suspects or at least without the\nwhole city knowing about it immediately but the game doesn't give you any real\noption.

Waiting ten seconds for enemies to hit you is not tense, it's an annoying filler task that serves to make the game boring.\nThe climbing is also very problematic, Altair will get stuck on things for absolutely no reason forcing you to drop and then try climbing all over again. The game also places a very large emphasis on stealth without having any practical stealth mechanics. The mission structure was cool in theory but it's poorly executed. It gives you no freedom and every assassination is extremely scripted.\nI'd LOVE LOVE LOVE to see this game updated for the modern audience on say, the Unity engine with better climbing mechanics, combat that doesn't suck and actual open ended assassination and info gathering. As it stands, this game feels like nothing more than the beta for the second game which improved things exponentially (except I was disappointed that the second game went for a less ambitious structure, but considering everything else it fixed I can forgive it).\nRead up the story of this game on Wikipedia then play the second if you want to get into the series.

I've got a folder for multiplayer games; that should be self explanatory. I've got a folder for currently installed games; that also is self explanatory. There's a folder for games I wish to play, a folder for games that I may play at some point, a folder for games I won't ever play that mostly consist of the extra, unwanted humble bundle games, and then there's the last folder. This folder is called \"Absolute Garbage Full of\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\" There are only two games in this folder, two games that are the worst of humanity and deserve nothing more than to be displayed in Museums where they display rotten games. One game is Deus Ex: Invisible War, the game that marked Ion Storm's downfall as they pandered to consoles, much like Crytek. The other is Assassin's Creed.\nDon't get me wrong, the Assassin's Creed series is not a terrible one, or so I've been told. I have only played this one and Assassin's Creed 3. I did not like Assassin's Creed 3, but dear god does it fail in comparison to this piece of flaky bull. You start out with a rather interesting concept of a story; you're in a laboratory undergoing a simulation to relate to your knife-oriented ancestors in some plot involving Templars. You go through an intro with some heavy fighting and you're thinking \"Oh, okay, this definitely is not a stealth game. This is a hack n slash.\" But whatever right? You suppose it can still be fun, right? Wrong, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you. You get these awful controls and repitive combat that make you yearn to go play with a toaster; at the very least the toaster would be responsive to controls. But whatever, again, you think, who cares if the combat is boring? I'm in it for the raw gameplay. Parkour man. Doing side quests. Story!\nWell, I'll give you that. Parkour is enjoyable. The wall climbing feels satisfying when you scale insurmountable heights leading up to the conclusion of a bird's nest at the peak of a city. But that's really the only thing it has going for it. When you enter a city, the side quests are by far the most boring, repititve, garbage nonsense that half the time doesn't even make sense. Why am I capturing flags? Why is there a time limit? I'm a trained assassin, not a crazed blue coin collector. There's tons of people being harassed and you can intervene, but why? You're told you're supposed to blend in, not ostracize yourself. Even if they did make sense, they're so senselessly boring the second time around that you do any of them.\nBut hey, there's no uPlay.", "hours": 0.3, "username": "Gondile", "products": 680, "early_access": false}

I've played through AC1 - Revelations on consoles and have decided to revisit AC1 - AC3 and eventually the rest on PC with 100% completion.\nThere are two mind sets I would review this game in; 1. Completing purely for the story and background. 2. Completely the game 100% (All collectibles and missions etc..).\nIf you're more of a number 1. then by all means purchase this game and enjoy the backstory to the others and if you're like me then play the rest. The only real downside the completing the game like this is sometimes the parkour movement will seem clunky especially late game. I won't spoil when I started getting frustrated with it.\nHowever if you're the wanting to full clear this game with all collectibles found and all missions completed then you may or may not want to skip this one depending on your patience.\nProblem 1. As I said the parkour in this game can be clunky if you're not going straight forward. As can be expected it's only the first in the series.\nProblem 2. The side missions are very repetitive. You will essentially have a cookie cutter copy of missions through each district in the game (a total of 9). The only thing changing will be the final assassination.\nProblem 3. Since I had decided to do a full completion run I found myself constantly Shift+Tabbing to a steam guide for all the locations. Now for some reason this game does not take that too kindly and if you remain in the Shift+Tab state for too long the game will simply crash. I have tried to numerous fixes I could find but not of them stopped the problem entirely. Thank fully AC1 auto saves after every collectible pick up so I never lost data. Just patience.\nProblem 4. Speaking of the final assassinations (don't worry no spoilers here). I found that most of them cannot be \"stealth\" killed. Now I don't entirely remember if the following games have improved on this to allow the player to stealth or styalise their final kills but in the first game it is essentially find the target, kill all the guards and then kill the target.\nThis is a great game for the first in its series and I highly recommend it for pure story playthroughs. If you are willing to go through 25+ hours and occassional crashes + clunky parkour at times then it will also be great for a full completion (all collectibles / missions).\nEnjoy and Happy Assassinating!", "hours": 25.6, "username": "G3N1S1S-", "products": 234, "early_access": false}

All in all, it has a good story (although static camera angles for long periods of time makes it difficult to commit to it), but unrefined gameplay.

Not to mention it's only like $10 anyway!\nSo what's so fun about it you might ask. Let me tell you. After you finally start running around and killing the enemies the game becomes fun! I have once spent 80% the mission just hunting the guards and doing all the other random things. For me, the selling part of this game is running around and jumping on the rooftops.\nControls. I understand that this game was ported from a console so controls for PC only users will be funny. I didn't not try to reset them because they are still well put. But, its not your normal WASD + ctrl and space. You will just have to get used to that.\nWhile playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city.\nThe very first time I ran this game was actually in 2007. The computer I was running it on couldn't even handle it. That is partially the reason why I only came back to the game now. At the time of release the graphics very amazing. The foggy city environment impressed me in particular. The models of characters are very well made as well, buildings are quite detailed. Nothing really to complain about as 7 years later it still looks good.\nYou might say, what an unfair review, where are the negative things? Well they are here as per any game. For example I don't quite like how character moves sometimes and how he cant do certain jumps and things. But its all negligible I think. Oh, and once I flew from my horse really high. The worst thing is that it only saves your game when you have completed something which can be quite an annoyance.\nThe story is not all there is to do. You can actually explore the cities to find some random flags. I am not too sure what they going to give you at the end, but there's quite a number of them to be found and  they also might be in places where you wont be able to reach from the first time. So a few more challenges. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the Templars. They are very hard to deal with, but there are always ways to abuse the system( find out for yourself).\nRe-playability is low in my opinion, because once you finish this game you can get the next one and then the next one and so on. You will be playing the same game but with the different filling inside.\nSo in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game( which evolved into a big sequence of games). I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody.", "hours": 20.2, "username": "Princess Gay X", "products": 354, "early_access": false}

The combat is mostly fun. Free running is mostly fun. The \"jump and tackle/stab someone\" move is awesome. But almost all of those have very frustrating moments that get all the more frustrating the more they happen.\nLockon is absolute crap. There was moments where I was trying to quickly assassinate someone with a throwing knife and ended up either missing or getting spotted before I could strike. To make matters worse, even if I was spotted but still close enough for a throwing knife kill, the game locks on the closest enemy to me.\nTo enter combat, one must press R to enter combat mode (read: lock on to enemies). This is EXTREMELY frustrating when you're trying to quickly dispatch one or two enemies in your way before moving on (when you're in group of five or more). There are also times you'll think you're fighting only to realize the game didn't automatically enter combat mode for you. It's extremely inconsistent.\nWhen on ledges near enemies, there doesn't seem to be away to assassinate your enemy without first awkwardly jumping down and hoping he doesn't hear you (unless you have throwing knives). I once had someone RIGHT in front of me but botched the stealth assassination because I was out of knives and couldn't do the \"jump wrist stab\" move.\nThe assassination get repetitive after awhile. You do the same thing over and over. Get 3 sources of info, report back, assassinate. Get 3 sources of info, report back, assassinate. Et Cetera. The concept is cool, but gets less interesting each time.\nWhen given advice on where to investigate, the game doesn't seem to keep a log of the info the local bureau has given you. That never get's annoying. Plus, it seems (from what I've seen) you must re-synchronize every time your told to investiage the \"southeast\" or \"north\" or whatever. That or they expect you to immediately recognize or remember what a Middle-Eastern hostpital looks like.\nFree running is super fun when it works. It's super frustrating when it doesn't. Altair might jump in the wrong direction, jump too far, not jump far enough, jump into a wall instead of an enemy, jump off a building, etc. This will ruin a lot of missions for you, or make them take longer.\nAlso annoying is when drunk and crazy people in the streets push you into others and you're chased by the guards because of it.\nSo yeah, as much as I hate certain parts of the game, I still recommend it. Just know what you're getting into.\nAnd here's hoping each future game gets better and better.\nAlso, the game seems to run like crap on DX10 (when there are more then 10 people in a crowd, the FPS drop like bombs). I had to open the Local Game Files (or whatever Steam calls it) to launch the DX9 version which runs a million times better (also why Steam only shows me having played the game for about 1 1/2 hours). And it's not because my PC can't handle the max graphics or anything. It's in the software. I can run BF4 on High-Ultra settings with my current setup.", "hours": 1.5, "username": "mdubmachine", "products": 123, "early_access": false}

Sure there's more to it than that, but what else do you need, really?\nHow about a great story with interesting characters?  Would that entice you?  Here we have Altair, an experienced assassin who's gotten a bit too big for his britches, so the leader of his order has decided to knock him down a few pegs.  In order to get back in the good graces of his mentor and his colleagues, he has to go track down several targets by the book and get back in touch with his roots.\nBut not all is as it seems . . . the morality of what he is doing begins to trouble Altair as he learns that his targets seem to be doing evil but also seem to have good intentions at heart.  And signs begin to point to a larger plot threading these targets together, bigger stakes to be won.  Eventually Altair has to learn what is going on, discover who he can really trust, and find a deeper understanding of himself and his creed.\nBut hey, let's not downplay the throatstabbing!  And the gutstabbing!  And the knife throwing and the sword fighting and the many other ways there are to murderize your enemies.  Plenty of running around on rooftops, jumping people while their backs are turned, and escaping into the crowd before the guards crack your skull open.\nThere are a lot of great ideas in this game!  Of course . . .\n. . . a lot of those ideas are not fully realized.  The first\nvery much feels like the testing ground for a lot of promising stuff, and sadly not all of it clicked right away.  Many of the missions and sub-missions are interesting at first, but lack variation, gradually becoming dull through constant repetition.  The combat can likewise become something of a chore, mostly just standing there waiting for your opponent to attack so you can counterattack, then waiting for the next opponent to attack so you can counterattack, ad nauseam.  Fast travel hadn't been introduced yet, so just getting from the central hub to any of the destination cities could take a depressingly long time.  Many of the stealth elements were handled in a very strange way . . . Altair can slowly plod around cities in full assassin regalia and a ton of weapons strapped to his bod, for example, and garner no attention whatsoever, but if he dares try to move even as fast as a somewhat brisk walk, the guards immediately sense he's up to no good and start viciously attacking.\nIn short, AC is dragged down somewhat by its own carefully constructed drudgery.\nNow this may all sound like I went back and played this game after playing the others am thus judging it unfairly against the progress made by those that followed, but I must point out that this is not so!  I started here and have been working my way through the series in order.  These problems are all things I noticed my first time through, and I was pleasantly surprised to find afterward that the later installments fixed a lot of them.  And despite all of that . . .\n. . . it's still an immensely fun game to play!  The greatness in the series overall is very easy to sense in this game because it's extremely close to the surface.

To leave you have to exit the animus, then quit. Took me too long to figure that out.\n-Combat can sometimes be slow to respond which, considering how lethal fighting is and the fact that you don't have medicine to heal mid-combat, can be a death sentence.\n-NO FAST CLIMBING.

Makes traversing areas painfully slow if you've played any of the other games which feature this faster climbing.\n-Altair's voice is plainly American, while everyone else in the Animus has period appropriate accents.

Replaying through the game the story isn\u2019t half bad, and am looking forward to reviewing the other Assassins Creed games in time.\nOne big negative thing is the way climbing works.

You start the game in real time, as a man named Desmond who has been taken by a company known as Abstergo Industries, a company where they are secretly part of the order of the Knight's Templars. The Templars are enemies to Assassins, and since Desmond is an ancestor of the previously meantioned assassin Altair, the head executive and his assistant Lucy put Desmond into a machine called the Animus. The Animus lets a person delve into his ancestor's memories, and since Altair is an ancestor to Desmond, the executive (i forgot his name, but lets just call him Bill) puts you into the Animus so he can monitor Altair's memories and find a secret that the Templars need that only Altair know. Once you are in the Animus, you finally play as Altair. You start in a mine looking for a Templar named Roberto, and once you find him, you see he is planning to steal the holy artifact known as the Ark of Covenant. You fail to kill him, and your other Assassins are left to kill him (one of them fails by the way). You go back to your master, Al Mualim, and he finds out about the attack. Suddenly Roberto and his fellow Templars are attacking, and you send a diversion to help. After you send the diversion, they flee, and Al Mualim punishes you because you did not remember the three strict rules to being an Assassin in the earlier mission. He stabs you, and you pass out. You are still alive and you must kill 9 other Templars to redeem yourself and be one of the master Assassins again.\nThe game is overall very good, but there are a few things I did not like. First of all, I know it is set in the First Crusades Period (somewhere around 1000 A.D it started) but Altair cannot hold any type of currency. Your gearand weapons are gained from each of the 9 Templars you kill. Also, in the trailer, Altair is seen to have a crossbow as one of his weapons, but that crossbow is nowhere in the actual game, so that got me dissapointed. Another thing is that youdont carry any types of medicine or potions or things like that, which would be useful in fighting because Altair isnt the best fighter without ALL of his weapons. Speaking of health, you dont have an actual health meter. Your health is displayed in something called a Synchronization Bar, a bar that fills as you do good in the game. If you commit crimes, your Synchronization Bar goes down. If you lose fights, it also goes down. Basically, anything bad makes it go down. Those are basically all the problems i have with this game.\nTo wrap it up, Assassin's Creed is a fun game with a really cool and exciting storyline, not alot of  situations i was mad or angry about, but it is old. The graphics are from somewhere around 2000 (i dont know when the games came out by years). So if you dont mind about graphics and want to have a fun action-adventure game with enticing storyline, Assassin's Creed is the game for you.\nMy Rating: 9/10\nNote from Author: There is stealth in this game. You will have to blend in with crowds, pickpocket without being caught, and if you are caught by a guard or someone you are pickpocketing, you can go blend in by sitting in a bench, hiding in a haystack, blending in with a group of scholars (they look similar to you in clothing), or just running away until they give up. There is a fourth way to blend in, but I forgot it. Another thing in this game is climbing and parkour. You will have to do alot of that, so be prepared.", "hours": 18.8, "username": "big chungo", "products": 35, "early_access": false}

If this review was written after my first play through when I played the game back on a PS3 some many years ago, I would only half-halfheartedly recommend this game.  However, after a full play through and many years to consider what had been bothering me before about the game, I finally had the proper mindset for this game.\nYou see, in this game, a game about stealthy killing (or in my case, not so stealthy killing) all the mechanics feed into that activity.  For example, it annoyed me in the original play through that I couldn't just pickpocket money to give to beggars to make them go away, or to buy knives from merchants.  Now I realize in my second play through that these things are mechanics meant to make being sneaky that much harder; the drunks, mentally impaired, beggars, etc are all there to make it harder for you to kill and silently blend into the crowd.  It bothered me that the game seemed more interested in making me run than stand and fight; with this newest play through, I see that they are trying to teach that discretion is the better part of valor, sometimes.  In other words, running from a fight is not a bad thing.  Not that that kept me from killing over 20 guards in a row, but it takes a bit of finesse, and full command of all your abilities.  This isn't God of War or Darksiders or some spectacle fighter, you aren't meant to hurtle towards foes (though near the endgame you certainly can).\nThe game feeds that need for moving fast, for speed and alacrity that is fed in other games by battle, but here it's fed by efficiency.  Be it moving over rooftops, through streets, killing guards, hiding, climbing, assassinating, escorting, whatever you do, the game expects you to be as efficient as possible, to make choices and change those choices as the situation demands.\nIn other words, even 6 years after its release, this game still is very good at forcing you to know all your tools.  You can't just know one attack, one move, and expect the game to work fine.  You could still get through, but the game would be much less fun.  No, this game demands that you know it well to play it well.  In that, it demands knowledge, and the intelligence of when to use your knowledge.  Much in the same way Altair must learn, you to must learn.\nAnd to me, that is a possible mark of a good game.

Instead he got kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. There, his real adventure begins. Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is capable to replay genetic memories of the user's ancestors. The Abstergo seeks to uncover information about Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, a legendary assassin from the Third Crusade.\nThe gameplay of Assassin's Creed is quite interesting but also very repetitive and linear. It's repetitive because before you assassination missions begin, you need to conduct some side mission to get information for your main mission. The side mission include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interogation and completing various task of your fellow assassin's which include, killing guards, race or flag capturing. You will do those side missions everytime you're going to assassinate someone. The good part is, you are free to choose which side mission you want to complete, only 3 from 6 side missions needed for the main missions to unlock. The freedom of the game is also quite big. You can explore the whole city of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Kill guards from behind, help civilian from rogue soldiers, find and kill templar soldiers or climb a tower and perform a leap of faith. You can travel from a city to another city with horses. Despite all these freedom, the game is till linear.\nThe graphics are beautiful and amazingly detailed. The textures are just, amazing. The animation are also very great. The physics effect are also good, you can watch dead guard roll over the rooftops and eventually fall to the ground. The lightning is perfect too. The environment combined with the AI make the game feels more alive with the civilians walking around, the guards patrolling about and some beggars will try to annoy you.\nAssassin's Creed is a good start if you want to dive into the world of Assassin's Creed series as this game contains the foundation of the whole story. Even with linear story, you still have the freedom to do many things in this game.

It's a sandbox nature game with remarkable visuals, sound effects and story, which is based on historical events and people. There are two overlaping stories in this game: Desmond Miles and Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, through machine called Animus. Within the Animus, Alta\u00efr's memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sabl\u00e9 from taking an artifact from a Solomons temple, but broke all three of the assassin brotherhood's tenets in the process. The brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Alta\u00efr to the rank of novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status. As Alta\u00efr assassinate them one by one he realises something is wrong about this assignment and that these people somehow are connected. Overall pretty good story,\nThe gameplay consist out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim. To achieve this goal, you must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional \"recon\" missions before attempting the assassination. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.\nOverall it\u2018s pretty good game, worth your attention but it does have downsides. The bad: It\u2018s repetitive and does not provide much graphic options for high end pc, combat is clunky and sometimes feels awkward. The Good: Fun parkour mechanics, great story, huge sandbox world that feels alive, great soundtrack, many little details. 7/10", "hours": 14.3, "username": "Zardu Hasslefrau", "products": 99, "early_access": false}

I had to play it.\nIt's a really pretty game, even by current 2014 standards.. but aside from that there's not much else in the way of redeeming features. You'll be doing a couple of things in this game, running around exploring, fighting and doing side quests.\nAll the side quests are the same, there's a million 'save a citizen' quests that just involve fighting some guards and then getting one of three canned replies from the person you rescued.. there's no variation in conversation.. by the end of the game you'll have heard a million other people say the same lines whenever you start to climb anything or knock anything over.\nClimbing / freerunning is the other big thing, but it feels a bit gimmicky in the game, there's very little reason to use it other than the game forcing you to use it to explore areas by getting to vantage points.By the end of the game I was using it for that purpose and just to get places quite far away quickly, everything else was easier to just stay on the ground in my opinion.\nCombat itself isn't fluid and locks away most of your combat moves until you progress the game, which makes combat start out clumsy and boring and ends up the same way as every combat move you get is defensive in nature, the entire combat system boils down to defending and counterattacking.. there's never any storming in and killing everyone like a badass.. there's storming and and defending yourself until everyone dies which just does not have the same feeling at all.\nEven the ending just really truly sucks, I don't want to put up any spoilers but it's one of the most dissapointing experiences I've had finishing a game.\nThe entire game is repititous and feels extremely grindy, by the end I was putting it on for an hour and then turning it off because it just felt like work.. unless you have the same issue as me and need to see the game yourself for the storyline before moving onto the next, then honestly skip this game.

As for the controls, I managed to play with the Xbox 360 gamepad so they weren't as clunky as mentioned with Keyboard+Mouse. Although, since this game is the first of this annual release franchise, there was many aspects that was clunky and boring. I'll get to that down below!\nThe game itself is linear and repetetive, but the amazing art style(which makes the game feel kinda \"dusty\"), freerunning mechanic and combat made the game a revolutionary success!\nPROS:\n+Intriguing story that keeps you guessing until the very end (both the animus and real reality),\n+Interesting visuals and especially the artstyle (Impressive graphics even to this day).\n+Amazing soundtrack (Jesper Kyd really truly rocks! It's great that he's back with AC2, AC: Brotherhood and AC: Revalations. Sadly, Ubisoft discarded this great composer for AC3 and AC4).\n+Freerunning gameplay adds some exploration to the game.\n+Escaping \"your assassination\" pumps your adrenaline! Sad this feature was removed on the other AC games as you actually feel like an assassin there.\nCONS:\n-Experienced a few game crashes and freezes so maybe it can be attributed to Windows 8.1 although, I haven't left any game progress!\n-Audio stuttering.\n-No subtitles (closed captions).\n-Repetitive submissions, tasks.\n-Can't swim!\n-Eagle Eye vision mode cannot be use while moving.\n-Annoying NPC that hinder your progress during freerunning (namely the beggars, drunks, etc).\n-HUGE amount of collectibles that serves no real purpose besides collecting (Flags).\n-Last missions requires you to SOLO fight multiple enemies at once and that repeats a few times. If you haven't mastered the controls by then, you'll be restarting quite often!\nRECOMMENDATION:\nYes, I really recommend this game if by some chance, you haven't played THE GAME that spawned a big successful franchise. You may become bored though once you finished the game so for the replayability factor, it can be either low or high, if you really liked it.

Pretty much everything is climbable. The implementation is not perfect and will sometimes frustrate you, but it is for the most part solid and works well. Without doubt, the satisfaction of scaling buildings and jumping across rooftops lasts the duration of the game.\nVisually, the game is stunning for its time. In particular the draw distance is very impressive. Standing at the top of a tower in one of the game's cities and being able to see past the city gates and to the rolling hills beyond is a lovely eye-candy experience. This is definitely a strong point of the game.\nI must, however, point out that the game is very poorly optimised - something I believe is largely endemic to the Assassin's Creed series on the PC. Aside from the frame rate being hard-capped at 60fps, I very rarely found myself hitting this number and instead would hover somewhere between 30-40fps.\nThis will turn a lot of people off and sadly there is no good reason or excuse for it. Obviously, this will annoy some people more than others. If you can \"tolerate\" a console-level refresh rate then you have nothing to worry about. For those used exclusively to frame rates of 60fps and above, however, you might as well give it a miss if you aren't willing to compromise on this aspect.\nAnother major criticism I would level at the game is its lack of variety and its reptitiveness. After I progressed past the initial levels and into the game proper, I often felt like I was playing an extended tech demo. It's clear that the title was built upon the climbing mechanic and that the plot and design came second.\nThis wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing were it not for the fact that you pretty much do find yourself doing the same few tasks over and over throughout the course of the game, with random spatterings of narrative here and there.\nAs someone who likes to complete all side objectives and acquire every collectable in my games, I found Assassin's Creed distinctly unrewarding in this regard. There are an (infamous) number of collectables in this game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What makes it is problem, however, are the literally non-existant rewards for actually finding all of them. The game also provides no tools to assist in your collectable hunt, instead simply relying on you meticulously combing every single inch of the maps in search of them. I disagree with this model simply because it takes up too much time unnecessarily. At any particular moment there are thousands of good games worth your attention - can you really justify spending an hour or two poking around a map looking for that one last pickup?\nPersonally, I say no - especially when the game doesn't reward you for it.\nDespite this, I would say Assassin's Creed is worth most people's time, if only to set yourself up for the other installments in the series. One thing I have been told repeatedly is \"Don't play later Assassin's Creed games before playing the first\" and I can imagine why this makes sense. The game is novel provided you haven't played similar titles or other games in the series, and the meta aspect of the plot can be compelling, although you ultimately learn very little by the end of the game.\nFor this reason, I recommend Assassin's Creed, if only to set yourself up to play the later installments in the series.", "hours": 28.9, "username": "Xeraii", "products": 99, "early_access": false}

Everything else is best described as \"the same stuff over and over and over again.\" The actual assassinations were somewhat cool with the dialog and set pieces, but there's no way it was worth doing the same investigations nine times to get to them.

I do not necessarily recommend it to people who have played the later installments. Anyone who hasn't played any AC game yet will do better with it's sequels because this original AC still lacked much. I did play it because I was curious to see how the series, Alta\u00efr's story and the story about \"Those Who Came Before\" started and was fairly disappointed.\nThe cities and rural areas are fairly nice to look at and ride through. However they all look and feel sort of the same, both weather and the daytime are static (the whole game plays at sunny daytime). Perhaps one can see more in it if he knows Damascus, Israel and the other cities you visit in this game, though I assume they have changed a lot over the centuries. Monumental places and buildings are not \"commented\" by the Animus system whatsoever, which makes it hard for people who don't know these cities to connect to them and to their history. You do not buy places, build your own \"home\" or interact with the cities in any bigger scale either (there isn't any money or economy to begin with). There is some awe-inspiring feeling to the whole of Maysaf being the center of the Assassin order, and both Alta\u00efr and his mentor have a feeling of serious- and meaningfulness you may miss within the later installments. But even then their outlines are fairly weak; after having finished this game I could hardly understand what the fuss about Alta\u00efr was about for people to apparently miss him so much when Ezio became the new protagonist in AC2. Alta\u00efr didn't feel as special as I had believed he was, hell you will probably dislike him because he is an arrogant \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 throughout most parts of the game.\nThe true letdown is the gameplay. The combat is underdeveloped compared to the sequels (you cannot strike down enemies  with assassination streaks as they were introduced with Brotherhood, you don't have as many weapons - it didn't feel as enjoyable) and the progression throughout the game is pretty repetitive. This original game is probably most faithful to the idea of being an assassin as you are constantly tasked to kill some templars hiding in the cities, often wealthy or well-protected people you need to \"locate\" first by doing minor tasks that in the later installments would pass for \"side activities\" at best: Eavesdrop one some guys, beat up/question another, pickpocket some intel from someone else and the likes. There are about 5 of these tasks to do per kill target, you choose which to do and need to finish about 3 of them to be able to \"locate\", approach and strike your kill target (which thankfully have some background, and are approached in a bit more interesting way than your previous tasks). After that you go back to Maysaf, speak to your mentor and go for a new target. Rinse and repeat. And that's already about it mostly. There are activities having the nature of \"collectibles\", like killing templars hiding in specific locations in the cities and rural areas, or saving citiziens from repressive soldiers, but those activites are very repetitive too. They didn't really motivate me much to roam about more than I had to. There are some unique story/plot moments, but they are rare.\nAlso, this game had an usability issue: It doesn't have subtitles. It may seem stupid, but apparently it wasn't self-evident back then. For a game trying to take serious steps in storytelling and bringing some past time to life it would help to understand all the people. I think they all speak English in this game (in the later games the citizens partly speak in their native language), but I still can't understand them all because English isn't my main tongue.

So let's begin from good:\nThe atmosphere that the game delivers when you finish prologue and arrive at the first city is spectacular. The feeling you get runing over the rooftops or through the crowd is amazing and never felt before. The city feels huge and has adequate medieval style atmosphere. The assassinations are the best part of the game as they are rather memorable experiences. Before them you usually see your target doing something horrible that makes him worth dying but when you're done you get to talk to him and you experience different side of the story which makes you think if killing him was worth it. It really makes you think about what's right and wrong and that's something rare in games. And while all that seems like an awesome game the other elements that create atmosphere seem to be weak, especially storyline. The game basically has no storyline at all, you only play to learn some secret in the end which doesn't even feel worth all the trouble. The characters are quite stereotypical too. And while Acre and Damascus feel different, Jerusalem city feels like some mix of the first two.\nNow to gameplay. The combat is great, you have a hidden blade for stealth, a sword for normal fighting and throwing knives for enemies in distance. That plus your character's parkour skills and you get all you need to feel like an assassin able to infiltrate and escape without enemies detecting you. On the other hand, the challenges you have to do to track down your targets are repetitive, kind of boring and random, not related to your mission or targets at all. What it means is that the game is not only short (took me 11 hours), but also monotonous. Extra challenges in the game like collecting feathers, killing templars feel meaningless as you don't get anything for doing them, plus they're boring.\nTech stuff:\nGraphics are really good for a 2008 game, soundtrack by Jesper Kyd delivers as it should. Controls feel complicated in the begining, but some practice and you're good to go.\nOverall an alright game, if you've never played other Assassin's Creed games and want to start or try, you should start with this, first one. Gives you amazing experience but unfortunately too short and repetitive.\nAtmosphere 7.5/10\nGameplay 7.5/10\nOverall 7.5/10", "hours": 11.9, "user_id": "76561197995219372", "username": "FOX15", "products": 104, "early_access": false}

The mental people and beggars get annoying quickly with the same sound clips over and over again so I ended up spending most of the game on the rooftops to avoid them, missing out on a lot of the city and feel at ground level.

This can be really annoying when accidentally falling down or trying to escape guards.\nAnother very annoying thing is the distracting citizens. The beggers, the drunk fist fighters, the people who just push you for no reason. I fail to understand why this content got into the game for any other reason but to annoy the player. You can't really make a stratigical move to avoid them since they are at random places and/or follow you around.\nThe gameplay becomes very repetitive once you got your first assassination, it's just climbing towers to find mini-missions, completing them and going for the big kill, which would be the only fun part of the game if all the careful planning, taking care of rooftop archers and finding a good escape route would not be ruined by a drunk guy randomly pushing me into my target or a guard.\nProbably the most annoying thing is the people of the cities speaking the same things over and over again. The high score for me was a guard harassing a guy saying \"You dare steal in my presence? That will cost you your life!\" six times over and over again.\nWithout all the annoying content the repetitive gameplay would not be so bad since the story seems great so far and the great (but currently buggy) engine of the game would compensate for the boring submissions.\ntl;dr: one of the most annoying games I've ever played and all it would take to fix it is a patch", "hours": 15.9, "username": "War Row Gape", "products": 276, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

You relieve the memories of Altair an assassin from the year of 1191. The story in this is great and makes you feel like there are two stories instead of one, the story of Altair's fight and stuggle against the templars and Desmond's involvment with Abstergo. Has one of the best twists I've seen in a game since it came out. 9.5/10\nGRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are of course dated since this was made in 2007. Still though they're pretty to look at and the 60fps wins me over with it's smoothness and textures but still it's dated. 7.5/10\nGAMEPLAY: Wow what can I say about gameplay, of course comparing the stuff you can do in AC compared to the others there's not much to do you only have 4 weapons, your fists,knive and mini knives,sword, and the iconic hidden blade but you do receive upgrades in the game as you progress through the main story. There are sidequests and with the PC version I was able to grab 4 more, annoying but helped in the main game. You can collect flags but to me there really was no point into them. Then there was the parkor and the view points....holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665their amazing. With the awesomeness of free-running and viewing the map piece by piece by the climbing on top of a tower and viewing it while an eagle is in the background just screams badass. Even though there's not much to do except do main and side missions you still have your own bit of fun. 8/10\nCONCLUSION: AC is a great game and again in my personal opinion is ranked 2nd best in my book due to it being the starting point to the series and NO FULL SYNC!

This is a good game, but it becomes borderline monotonous and repetetive.\nI loved the story and the settings the game takes place in, being able to ride horseback, the \"stealthy\" parts of the game. Practically everything. What I hated was, no ability to save your game (it autosaves and you can't skip cutscenes so if you exit and start back to a point you already where...you have to wait), it becomes a real pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665at times. The storyline missions become very repetetive and are basically almost the same until you get to the intended target. Go into city, find person, kill person, etc... It gets very tedious if you try and finish the game in one go. Thankfully you get \"fast travel\" which cut down on the repetetive nature slightly. I got so bored at one point, I started pretending I was Batman and killing guards 'cause they kept bragging about their parents. The timed missions were annoying (some more than others, but I think you can ignore them for other quests to progress if you aren't 100%'ing the game) and one I felt was poorly designed (the timed one where you break the stalls which puts guards on you in seconds which takes precious seconds away, the time is too short, people scatter and you can't exactly grab people and bring them there without automatically throwing them). They couldn't add an exit button to the main screen, so you gotta go back into your profile and exit. My favorite, the main character has Aquagenic urticaria. You touch water and bam dead which was fun when he kept missing simple friggen jumps.\nThe repetetive-ness and the lack of a proper save option were my two main gripes but the rest of the game makes up for it. If anything don't expect to binge play this to the end. I kept playing in blocks, If I played straight through, I'd have been extremely bored.

All the ancient cities are well designed for bounding across rooftops and clambering over walls while you avoid the city guard and Templars.\nI hadn't played a game with combat set up like this before I gave it a try, and it's a very rewarding feeling to get the timing just right to dodge, parry, and deliver a killing blow to any number of attackers.  Obviously the system of \"Everyone attack, just one at a time\" is realistically silly, but it makes the game simple enough that you aren't ever overburdened, as long as your timing is up to par, even when facing more than ten attackers.\nThe missions are enjoyable at first, but they tend to get repetitive after a while, as there are only a handful of different types of mission.\nAnd oh god, the flags, they do nothing.

This was not my introduction to this series. I had played ACIII first on a friend's Xbox 360. I then decided that I shall learn of the other Assassin's before. Now, in this day and age 7 years is a long time and as of writing this review it has been like almost 7 years since this game came out. It is technically \"old\" which is dumb because something like SimCity 1 is old not some game from 7 years ago that looks fine now.\nAfter playing ACIII I was willing to understand that AC1 came out a good 5 years before and is probably not as good. I then realised that Altair, unlike Connor controls like he has cinderblocks strapped to his thighs and he has\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off gravity sometime in the past. His running speed, while still lightyears faster than mine, was severly slower. He also plummets to the ground like a  semi-realistic cartoon character who has realised that he is off the cliff and now must fall. It's great that there are conveniently placed Hay bales every 3 feet to blanket Altair's drunken falling.\nThey talk about how Altair is one of the best Assassin's at the time, if this is true, no wonder the templars (evil generic bad guys) have been stomping on the Assassin's (Secret organization who pretty much took the Robin Hood thing really almost too far, especially the hood bit.) Altair has to have a conversation with words so large and self interested they practically walked away to buy a new yorker and sip drip coffee every time he kills a target and this is quite a few times, like 9 in the game. 9 times you have to listen to the generic douchewaffle say the same thing as the last generic douchewaffle but in a slightly more snotty and arrogant way. These cutscenes get to be like 9 or 10 minutes long and they're UNSKIPPABLE!\nI should probably go over the plot before I rip into the game anymore. Well, you're Altair an assassin who works for the assassins. He is given 9 people to kill in order to get back some artifact or something. That's it. For a story driven game the story is pretty lackluster. At the end there is plot twist, that I'm not gonna spoil, but if you didn't see it coming from several million lightyears away, I suggest you stop eating paste and finish 1st grade.\nThe 9 assassinations I mention before, cannot be completed right away, because then the game would be like 45 minutes long. You have to take part in the same 4 minigames before you can assassinate your target. Now, the assassination is obviously the fun part. It's in the name. Most of the game however is tailing some poorly voice acted (I'll get to that later)\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665or pickpocketing from some poorly voice acted\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665which sounds fun... but is just walking up to them pressing shift and running away like some socially inept girl scout on her first day of selling cookies. You are rewarded with some information that is for some reason necessary but you never actually use. These minigames should either be toned down or be gone. The absolutely worst one is the eavesdropping one. All you do is sit on a bench kind of close by and DO NOTHING. I went and  got my hot pocket out of the microwave when these bits happened. I'm sure the game wouldn't have sold as well if it was called BENCHWARMERS CREED.\nIt also felt somewhat anticlimactic during a few of the assassinations. They either involved walking up beside someone in a slightly more colorful robe and stabbing them or walking up in front of them and stabbing them with a throat while the broken AI decided whether they should stop you from stabbing them or continue walking into a wall.\nThe actual combat that wasn't assassinations was generally just block block stab. It was a more depressing and violent version of simon says.\nNow, I've saved most of the good for the last. The setting is awesome spanning 3 fair sized cities Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. Jerusalem is more Jewishy, Damascus is mor Islamy and Acre is more \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. My problem with the cities though is not the size, which every reviewer seems to think is a problem. Every open world game doesn't need to span \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing Bavaria. My problem is samy-ness. One block in Acre looks like every other block in Acre, etc. They look cool, but its the same cool. There are a few historical landmarks, but the only city I was even remotely familiar with was Jerusalem and I only recognized Dome of the Rock. It was cool to climb it though!\nSo, lets see. Semi \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 freerunning controls that are still pretty good in comparison to most game controls, nice areas if not semi-samey, a main character who was acted by the Intern at Ubisoft and a boring storyline.

It was pretty damn great then, but now its age really shows. The only thing that's like I remember is the combat, which is somewhat difficult at times. Air assassinations are possible but annoying (want to kill a civillian? here's your chance), stealth is almost nonexistent, and climbing things turns out to be a chore, as Altair takes forever to make his way up buildings.\nSide quest? What are those? Each time you go to one of the 3 major cities, you have to investigate your target. This comes down to repetitive side quests involving pick pocketing, beating people up for information, eavesdropping, and some other silly missions like collecting flags or killing archers. There's no variety, and you can't cut to the chase (most of them have annoying cutscenes). By the time I was on the last few assassinations, I was doing as little as possible to get through the game. There was no reason to complete everything aside from lengthening your time with the game.\nThe plot and the characters inside the Animus are also very forgettable. Who are these people I'm killing? Why am I killing them? Oh, they're templars. Well that makes sense. But who ARE they? I don't remember any of the names of the 9 people I was tasked to kill aside from the \"big bad\", Robert de Sable. The game doesn't make it a point to try and make the characters memorable.\nAltair is a bland protagonist. His arrogance is frustrating and his decisions make no sense sometimes, or at least he rarely justifies them. His \"growth\" is only shown in one scene where he reiterates what he was told at the beginning of the game about the Creed. His voice acting also sucks, but that's besides the point.\nI still recommend this game because it's where the series started, and outside the animus scenes are still interesting. Learning about the fight between the assassins and the templars in the present day, meeting Desmond, etc, are all still worth the time you have to put into the game itself. Will you want to play it again anytime soon? Probably not. In a few years I'll just use wiki pages to refresh my memory on what's important.

Altough AC has turned into a yearly release game, which usually means a decline of quality, it is one of the few games that actually has a story which is not like from a mediocre tv soap episode. AC 1 sets the tone and introduces the storyline which is very interesting. The graphics are still good, and set the right atmosphere. I personally liked the set of AC1 the most, because I really like the history of the crusades in 1190. The designers did a real good job to give the player the right atmosphere and setting of the holy land and it's look-alike back then (of course just of our todays imagination of it).\nIts' a great game which you can actually playthrough pretty quick, so it is worth the time. The only let down is the repeatance of the game which starts to bore. Here you can feel the understandable fact that this franchise and it's genra was in it'S birthstate, it set the technical aspects right (detailed sandbox cities whith AC's well know climbing aspects).

If you played and liked the other Assassin's Games, you will probably like it as well, however, there are some key differences.\n\n1) As many people have mentioned, thier is no economic system or money in the game at all. Instead, unlike all the other games, rewards are received for performing missions, whether it is save the citizen, where you deal with a certain number of soilders to save someone, or  completing the mission cord, you will advance and go further from there.\n2) There is no notriety gauge- Later in the franchise, there is a notriety bar, which shows how close, or how easily, guards recognize you. Instead, ,they have something more like a noticability bar. The main differnce is no matter how bad you were somewhere else, say, a few blocks away, and you kill a bunch of guards and civilians, it will not seem to affect your noticability, as they seem to notice you if you are in an area they don't want to be in (seems like a good time to mention there are no restricted zones) or are doing socially unacceptable actions (running, pushing, knocking over crates, stabbing the guards buddy).  There is also no way to remove this bar, as, unlike later games, you cannot no longer be recognized becuase a poster on a third floor flowerbed is removed.\nThose are some of the main noticable differences in my opinion, of course there are more, but not as important.

Oh, sure, the assassinations drive the plot, and they are probably the high points of the game, but a lot of this game made more sense to me when I discovered it was originally concieved as a Prince of Persia spinoff. And that really is the case - the chase sequences and getting around the open-world environment generally consists of hopping and swinging around. It lacks the motivational buzzsaws and spiked pits of its forebear, but the combat and platforming is really remisicent of the Sands of Time series.\nA lot of people complain about the controls, and the \"one-button\" platforming can result in some annoying moments. When it works, it's delightful as you leap from beam to beam effortlessly. But sometimes, you'll be running across rooftops, trying to flee some guards, and running into a small raised portion you expect to spring over, when suddenly you cling to it like a koala as the guards surround you. The fault, to me, is largely in the environments, which at times have obstacles or areas the controls really aren't designed for.\nThe missions are the simple fare you'd generally expect for an open-world game - go here, fight there, etc. Most missions are repeated over and over, making the assassinations a fresh breath of air between having to rescue scores of civilians. If you don't worry about completing every mission, I understand this game can be powered through in a few hours, like many open-world games. Most of the missions are simple and not terribly difficult, with the exception of some later stealth missions that are a frustrating exercise in trial and error.\nDespite being over half a decade old at the time of this review, the game is gorgeous. The environments are immersive and great, and the missions where you climb up to the top of a viewpoint never got old for me on account of the amazing vistas. About the only criticism that really can be leveled are the somewhat wooden faces during cutscenes. As far as game art goes, it's a great artistic achievement, with a distinctive environment.\nCombat is much like Prince of Persia, only the main issue is that basic timing with counterattacks will win nearly every fight. Most of my fights consisted on spamming attacks, and as soon as an enemy attacked, counter. The game often tries to punish you for transgressions with hordes of guards, which are easily dispatched to clear your wanted status. It's similar to the fighting systems from later games like Arkham Asylum or Sleeping Dogs, only plagued with one good solution to many issues.\nThe story and setting are interesting and unique, even if the overall plot ends up a bit lacking. The assassination targets are often interesting and blatantly cast in shades of grey, often leaving it to the player as to whether or not their death was warranted. Unfortunately, many of the assassinations boil down to a plain fight, often without a means to perform a \"clean kill\". Despite the Crusades-based setting, it doesn't play heavily into the plot, and doesn't delve too much into matters of history, instead focusing on its own conspiratorial mythology. The modern framing sequences are interesting in their implications, but are hampered by strictly being a narrative device, not allowing the player any agency and a bare minimum of exploration.\nDespite the flaws, I'd generally recommend giving it a shot if it still sounds interesting, especially since it's regularly on sale during the Steam sales. It's a good barometer for deciding whether or not you'll enjoy the following games (which are major expansions and refinements on the gameplay presented there), and honestly it's worth trying as something quite different from an AAA developer. It's an experiment in a lot of ways, though, and you have to go in understanding it's a fairly flawed gem.\nEdit: Also ignore the flag collectibles entirely. It's one of the worst collectible systems devised and is entirely skippable, and you earn nothing more than having a spot filled in on your pause menu.

The rush of killing a target and fading into the crowd, or racing across the rooftops to safety is immensely satisfying... for the first 3 hours or so. Well I've played this game for about 20 hours and the last 10 have been some of the most frustrating times I've spent gaming in my entire life. Let me Explain.\nThe game is absolutely stunning in the visual and aural sense. The cities feel incredibly alive and full of movement, bustle and conflict. The game's handling of light and shadow is incredible, especially for a game from last year. The animations on the player character and the NPC's are astounding. As far as making you feel like you're in the holy land during the crusades, this game is incredibly successful. It redefines \"atmospheric\". Yet after your first real assassination mission, when you start to realize that every single one after it is more or less exactly the same in the bulk of the gameplay, you quickly become less and less enthralled with the game.\nEvery single district of every single city is the same for gameplay purposes. You gather information that has no real bearing on your mission, you save citizens, and you climb towers for incredible views. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Even the PC's extra missions cannot help vary the gameplay enough to stop this. It is some of the laziest gameplay design I've ever seen.\nAnother major flaw of this game is that while it looks much better on the PC, the controls for both fighting and freerunning are incredibly consolized and clunky. They make the game feel like a lazy port. In that same vein if you fail missions there's no way to have saved your progress midway or fight your way out. If you screw up an archer assassination with one archer, you must start over from the beginning, which deprives you of a choice to keep fighting, and is incredibly annoying.\nAnd while the level design is mostly great, the \"Arsuf\" level is blatantly stacked and terribly designed, and reeks of lazy gameplay design.\nMy final major bone to pick with the absolutely laughable story. To be fair, I have always mocked conspiracy theories, and their use in games has always irked me, but assassin's creed takes the prize. The fact that I assassinated a few key individuals means that the crusades will suddenly end, Richard and Saladin will come together at the \"evil\" Templar's bidding and destroy a small cult of Assassin's? Ridiculous. And of course the whole animus technology is funny as hell. Genetic memory??? HA!\nAnyways, that's not to say the story isn't well written, it's just that at times the suspension of disbelief isn't there.\nOverall, the game is gorgeous, immersive, and atmospheric, but it is also badly designed, relies on silly story crutches, and is heavily consolized.", "hours": 26.2, "username": "Brendissimo", "products": 329, "early_access": false}

You originally play as Desmond Miles, who is a descendent of a order of Assassins who know a terrible secret that the company Abstergo who is secretly under the influence of the Templars is trying to find out. They kidnapped Desmond Miles to uncover the secrets left within the past through a machine called the Animus which allows a user to relive the past of his ancestor through manipulation of the genetics of a person. While inside the Animus the player will play as Altair who is the main assassin in the game, you will be forced to slay 9 evil men who hold the secret that the Templars are after and ultimately uncover the truth.\n\u2022 Characters: 7/10\no Assassin's Creed's characters arent as colorful as other characters of other games, but they do seem to hold a interesting point of view considering the fact that most of the game takes place in steed of historical events. You will be playing as Altair who is pretty much a bad\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665persona Assassin who thinks he can do anything but learns that he is far from perfection, he not only refines his skill as an assassin but refines his character, you will go through different trials and tribulations meeting a strange array of characters who at first seem oddly placed within the game but follow through the storyline's path. In terms of NPC characters, they are no different from what you would see in a typical GTA game.\n\u2022 GamePlay: 8/10\no Assassin's Creed is pretty much action oriented but also dwells in stealth action. The game plays in a Sandbox type of style similar to GTA, you can easily travel around cities and certain locations. You can climb rooftops, buildings and towers. You can blend with people to cover your tracks or to get through certain obstacles. There are about 3 cities in which the game will mostly take place: Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. Within each city, you must activate missions from the Assassin Bureau, find view points and activate them to see a wider area of the map. Rescuing citizens will allow you to find allies who will help you from pursuing soldiers. You can also do mini missions such as Race challenges, flag collecting challenges or escort missions. You mainly do interrogations and pickpocketing to advance in the storyline, once you complete at least 3 of the missions, you can head back to the Bureau to start the assassination mission where you will be forced to see a storyline scene involving the victim and surrounding characters, and then afterwards you must go for the kill and escape afterwards back to the Bureau without being under the watchful eye of the soldiers. There are about 7 memory blocks in total with each giving you about 1-3 assassination missions, you will also be able to converse with the two characters outside the Animus and read the messages. Once you complete a mission and return to the main city you originally started in, you will be upgraded with a new weapon feature or health meter. Throughout the game's view points, saving citizens and such , you will be awarded a DNA sync point, when it gets to the maxed which is 15, your Sync health meter will increase.\n\u2022 Graphics: 8/10\no Assassin's Creed was released right around the time when the current gen was starting, due to the fact it was in design between the two generations, you can see a mixture of the two generations within the game. Some say it looks like it should of been released on the Xbox and PS2, while others welcome the release on the PS3 and Xbox360. However since we are reviewing the PC version, graphics wise it could differ depending on your graphics card. You will notice that NPC characters will have drawn faces similar to a GTA III style or something you would see in a WWE game. Only the main characters who play a major role in the game will actually have full fledged facial features. The game's environment at first may seem a bit bleak and bland, but it is necessary due to the storyline's dark tone and time.\n\u2022 Sound: 10/10\no Assassin's Creed consists of several made noises, clashes and sound effects. You will notice a great detail of effects depending on your actions, from the grunting of your attacks to the final breath of your victims, from the clashing of swords towards the climbing of the buildings. This game contains alot of vocal acting, as many of the NPCs will talk about 90% of the time and there is barely any text for you to read unless they are instructions or messages you read off of the animus. The game also consists of amazing voice work as well which players will enjoy along with the revolving storyline.\n\u2022 Music: 7/10\no Assassin's Creed music isnt as vibrant as most games, one can say its similar in number of tracks as a typical Resident Evil game. The music within the game consists of several orchestral dramatic tones which players will gain a beat of suspense when they hear the song playing during a duel or a battle. Much of the music is calm as well depending on what you were doing whether it was an assassination or escaping from pursuing soldiers. Music isnt really a strong point as you would need all the silence you can get from background to see what and who you are facing as a obstacle within a mission.\n\u2022 Length: 6/10\no Assassin's Creed is divided into memory blocks, there are about 7 in total, some of them consists of you killing 1, 2 or 3 targets before progressing through another. You will be going back and forth towards many of the areas of the three major cities, and depending on which block you are, some areas will be restricted or changed. Assassin's Creed should take you at least 20-25 hours to finish the main storyline, however more can be achieved if you are bent on collecting flags and completing all of the missions, view points and the rescue of citizens.\n\u2022 Replay Value: 8/10\no Assassin's Creed's main weakness would be its replay value, as you wont get much from replaying the game nor do you unlock any special level or ability. You can go back and attempt older missions and memory blocks, but there's nothing more to that.\n\u2022 Player Value: 10/10\no Assassin's Creed is an enjoyable new game where people who are fond of conspiracies will surely enjoy the amazing storyline with a twist. Players will also enjoy the amazing unique gameplay and the different views of places which are based upon actual real life locations. Any person who is a fan of Action, stealth or sandbox games will surely love this game and will be glad to add it to their collection.", "hours": 22.2, "username": "Basilicious", "products": 1411, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 205, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-12-29", "text": "- Personal Rating: \"Single Playthrough\"\n- Traditional Rating: \"7 / 10\"\nThe first game in the now very popular Assassin's Creed franchise. While this entry wasn't as popular as the following sequels, it's still a pretty decent game even now in it's own right. In this entry, you play as the arrogant Altair (and Desmond controlling him through a machine called \"The Animus\") as he is forced to recover his original rank among the Brotherhood after a mission gone wrong.\nNow, bearing in the mind that this IS the first game in the series - the game has two \"stances\" combat and movement. In movement, there are further two stances - Blended mode, movement is slower but makes you less conspicuous, even less so if you use the \"Blend\" command and then there's the \"Free Run\" mode, where you hold down a key/button and movement will be much faster and will be able to automatically scale walls, jump from buildings, etc as well as do a more \"flashy\" assassination maneuver. The combat stance is accessed when you are locking on to an enemy and have a weapon drawn. By holding the same key/button you use for \"Freerun\" is the same key you use to block incoming enemy attacks, the rest of the moveset is a your standard attack, grapple and step (dodge) - by holding the block key and pressing the attack key will initiate the Counter animation (when unlocked). It's not a very complex system but it works and is fun to experiment with.\nAltair has with him an arsenal that gets bigger as you progress through the game (Yes story, not collectibles). You start out with a standard sword and of course your handy Hidden Blade. Later on, you gain the (overpowered) throwing daggers and a better standard sword. Now I made a mention of the daggers per se because you will be using these a LOT. They one shot enemies off combat or if you're far away from them, they work on Assassination targets fights by decreasing their health by quite a lot and staving regular enemies off easy.\nNow the real meat of the game is, of course, exploration and assassinations. Each city and the road in between them is filled with bustling life that looks and feels very natural as well as enemies and NPCs react to what you're doing very realistically - like say if you're scaling a wall, an NPC will say something according to it. Every city, like Jerusalem, Acre, etc - is very detailed themselves and is a visual treat to see. The enemies and NPC models are pretty well varied across each city with minor details changed up in faces to distinguish some people from others, their facial expressions and the such are also pretty decent, though not as good as Altair's.\nAs far as your objectives in the game go... it's nothing very interesting, at all. Each city has about the same objectives everytime you're sent on an Assassination mission - you're forced to climb up to Synchronization points scattered through that city until you find \"Investigation\" missions, which serve more as game padding than anything else in my opinion because they aren't varied enough. Two of them involving fellow assassin's have you racing from Point A to point B within an alloted amount of time, another has you \"stealth\" killing special enemies - other missions involve \"Interrogations, which have you following an NPC around till you feel it's a correct time to beat the information out of that person, another has you \"Eavesdropping\", a mission that has you merely sit on a bench and listen to two NPC babble on, and one that involves listening to NPCs babble on about some special item, whom which you \"Pickpocket\" from them. You only need atleast 2 or 3 out of the usual 6 per Assassination Mission to actually access the Assassination mission. And this process will repeat about 9 or so times throughout the ENTIRE game. One issue I had with the game was that it felt a little too random at times. There were times where I failed an investigation mission, had to kill the enemies or die so I could restart it merely because there was a group of enemies walking by that for some reason notice you while others don't. It was irritating. - However the actual assassination missions are amazing, and easily the most fun you will have in the game. You can complete most assassination missions without being seen and resorting to combat since there's no set timer and the game forces you to think your options through and act accordingly. Some later missions sadly force you to resort to combat, which lessens the impact the assassination has because it's a bit random, you can be fighting a group of enemies and then another second when you counter ANOTHER enemy, you'll see Altair jump on top of the target and kill him randomly.\nAn issue I did have with the game that may put off a lot of people - combat. The combat is generally really slow and clunky and is really random. At first, the enemies behave pretty predictably and are easy to kill - more so considering that they actually wait until you kill someone else first and just stare at you brutally murdering them THEN decide to attack you, or some enemies actually flinch allowing for an easy chain kill - then they start countering your moves as enemies get stronger. Unlike what you may read around, no, later on in the game, most counters will NOT one hit kill enemies, Altair may just push them back and you have to do that killing yourself by attacking the downed enemy. Something that I felt was rather random was sometimes the counters don't seem to work outright, and you end up taking more damage than what you needed to, sometimes because of things outside your control. Later on aswell, the enemies take a liking to grappling you a LOT and that can get REALLY annoying. Not to even mention that you CANNOT hit the boss enemies when they are grounded. The AI is also really stupid - in closed areas of the game, if you get low on health, just run circles around the enemies until you get some health back.\nAll in all though, I had fun with the game. I actually do recommend it lightly to those that enjoy the thrill that is careful preparation and to those that love seeing worlds that feel alive. Annoyances like the NPC beggars (whom will actually block movement sometimes and are EXTREMELY annoying), the random and clunky combat, and the repetitiveness of the Investigation missions will seem more forgetable after you get to the better parts of the game. Altair becomes a more likeable character and the story itself, while not as clear (sequels) will actually keep you wanting to see more of what the game can offer - and of course the amazing Assassination Missions, the reason you're playing this game.\nEdit: I forgot to mention, this game DOES have collectibles in the forms of Flags scattered across the world. I personally didn't go after them in the game as they have no real incentive or motive to collect them other than for collectionists' sake.", "hours": 12.0, "username": "Emily Lux", "products": 1680, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "15100", "page": 205, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-12-29", "text": "The first, and probably worst, in the Assassin's Creed series.\nWhen this game first came out people, I included, thought it was revolutionary.  The historical fiction story of an ancient battle between the assassins and templars that draws ties to present day conflicts, the philisophical conflicts brought forth between both sides, and of course, the free running mechanics.  These story elements were things not seen often outside of traditional RPG's and this may be the first triple A title to do so.  The story was a bit cerebral for such a wide audiance, and some gamers may lose interest, but I was captivated.\nThat said, if you've played any of the instalments since, and you're just coming back to see who this Altair character is, you're probably going to be very disappointed.  Remember all those pointless quests and collectables present in the other games?  Here you will find the most annoying and most pointless examples of said quests and collectables.  Thankfully, there are no achievements for this version, erasing any point of getting most of them in the first place.  The story, while good, is the least interesting, and least weird, of the series so far.  The world is very bland and the cities don't have few landmarks by which to navigate so you will almost constantly be bringing up the map to figure out where to go unless there's a marker for your destination.\nOverall this is a good game though, and I can't bring myself to not recommend it.

It's pretty much the epitome of terrible console port - starting with the menu and exit game mechanism that makes it literally take several minutes to quit unless you press ALT-F4.  Seriously Ubisoft - 6 menus to quit the game?\nBeyond that, as the game is called Assassin's Creed you would be forgiven for thinking it will be about stealth assassination.  Generally, it's not - very few of the true assassinations in the main plot allow different angles of approach or stealth mechanics.  You would assume an assassin would prefer to avoid doing their work in public, or would prefer to use a handy bow from a nearby roof - you would be wrong, though.  Rather, you are expected to get in close, which inevitably means getting into combat.  That's also a strike - the combat is bloody terrible.  Again, the console port-ness appears, as the combat is typical of other console ports (I'm looking at you, Prince of Persia Sands of Time) and is not at all intuitive for PC players.  Much of it relies on timing moves, which don't appear to register well, and are better suited to a controller.  In fact, the majority of the game is best suited for a controller - or to be watched in a LP rather than played.\nTL;DR:  For a game that was published well after the Thief series, Deus Ex, and a myriad of others that contain aspects of stealth assassination, they all do it much better than Assassin's Creed.

Apart from that the audio doesn't really stand out in any particular way, everything sounds like you would expect.\nis heavily story driven. The story and premise is fairly interesting. The historical part of the story (the important part IMO) is about a disgraced assassin trying to redeem himself. The protagonist sees himself as the bringer of justice etc.\nUnfortunately the games is boiled down to but a few core gameplay mechanics such as fighting/evading, eavesdropping and, and the main one, assassinating. This makes the game incredibly tedious. The meat of the story is the assassinations, but to get to that you have to do a set number of the other stuff first. Unfortunately the other side missions become tedious after just a few times because it is ALWAYS the same. After 20 hours of gameplay I completely lost interest and stopped playing. Travelling between locations is also uninteresting, but thankfully there is a quick travel option.\nOne thing that I just can't understand is the requirement to walk when near the authorities, it just doesn't make any sense at all. In Hitman it is somewhat logical, you are in disguise so you must walk to maintain your cover, but in Assassin Creed you wear your assassin's outfit everywhere, so what difference does it make if you walk or run?\nThe sandbox presentation is wasted on this game, I think it would have been more successfull as a linear mission based style like Hitman. The developers limited the core gameplay too much when compared to the likes of GTA.\nIf you have plenty of time to waste, this is an above average game but the repetitive gameplay was just a bit much for me, I can't recommend it to people with limited game time. Take a look at Far Cry 3 if you want a really good sandbox, or the new Tomb Raider for a nice linear experience. Both of those games felt shorter than this even though they probably aren't and they both felt much more engaging and interesting.", "hours": 23.2, "username": "Deimos", "products": 628, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

That alone will sell it for some people, so I figured I'd start with that.\nStill here? Alright.\nThe controls for freerunning are mostly handled by the game, you simply hold the right buttons down and push the direction you want to go. I'm usually skeptical about letting a game try to decipher what I wanted my character to do based on very little actual control, but in this case, I almost never fell to my death based on a decision the game made for me, which is good. The combat is pretty easy, and the controls are as tight as the sequels. The swordplay is intuitive. Usually, the only time you will get destroyed is if you happen across an elite enemy early on, with many of your advanced skills missing. The combat in this game is very much for fans of the \"one-man-army\" idea. There is very little actual stealth required. Even if you screw it up and the entire city is out to kill you, you can defend yourself without a problem if you can counter. That said, the stealth is not unfun. The game is very up-front about giving you feedback on everything you need to know about who or what is or isn't your enemy, what you can and can't get away with, and when you are and aren't visible, at all times.\nThe story is good, but it's better in the sequels. It's also pretty repetitious in this game. After your first or second assassination, you can probably decide for yourself if you will enjoy the rest of the game. The only break from the norm is near the end, where you will be forced to play out the \"one-man-army\" scenario mentioned above, so again, I emphasize, this is not really a stealth game. It's a hack-and-slash with stealth elements, where both are mostly optional. This means, though, that you are given the choice of how you want to play the game. You can hide in plain sight, mocking your enemies from the crowd, or you can be a total delinquent, make the guards very angry, and kill the beggars that throw rocks at you (the game stops penalizing you for that once the story is completed). The assassination missions also have multiple solutions. You are given a lot of freedom in terms of gameplay, again, except at the end. Stealth is impossible during the final chapter. Overall, I would recommend playing through Ezio's storyline (Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) first, then giving this one a try if you find yourself a fan.

Development process was apparently cut a bit short and Ubisoft was quite surprised by the success. This is also a rough console port, with a menu system very possibly designed by Satan himself.\nAltair is a hard man and hard to like as well. He is completely asexual (in this game at least) and more intellectual than emotional in temperament. Yet this uncompromising attitude has it's benefits and Altair does not wear out his welcome. His voice actor, however, is a completely flaccid line-reader. Peter Renaday (Duncan from Dragon Age) steals the show as Al-Mualim.

It's too bad that the following games in the franchise stopped urging the player to seek alternative ways to kill their targets, 'cause that's something Assassin's Creed does right.", "hours": 34.2, "user_id": "76561197977766807", "username": "Julian", "products": 275, "early_access": false}

Full of action, excitement, and thrills, you're guaranteed to have plenty of fun.\nThe controls are fairly simple, but aren't the best. They take a bit to get used to, and for those who have played the recent games, they are nothing alike. The story is somewhat hard to follow. You are a bartender who is kidnapped by a company called Abstergo to dig through your mind by using the Animus, a device in which plays memories of your ancestor, memories you cannot access on your own. The reason of your capture is because of your family: your family are members of the Assassin's Brotherhood, dating all the way back to the Third Crusade, in which the story takes place, putting you in the shoes of Altair, an assassin whose reckless action cause a friend to die, but is pardoned. Instead he must start training again to prove his worth, assassinating nine targets assigned by the Brotherhood leader, Al Mualim. As the story progresses, you learn more about why Al Mualim wants these nine dead, and the bigger picture in the adventure. The ending is pretty confusing, and leaves you wondering what the heck is going on.\nThe gameplay is smooth, with the emphasis on stealth. You can take out your sword and slash your way through, but it is much more difficult. The sequels improve on the mechanic, but, again, on it's own the combat is much fun.\nFor a 2007 game it still looks great.

The entirety of the gameplay consists in riding an horse near patrols of guards with a strict max velocity policy on very large distances, reaching a city, performing some side-quests which remain exactly identical till the end, gameplay-wise, and then, at last, performing your assassination. And off you go again.\nI'd say too it's something that can drive you away from the title. However, Assassin's Creed got two features that I was never able to find in the following sequels:\n1)The game really made me feel like an assassin, having to reach the target's town and gathering information before planning my move. Also, unlike Assassin's Creed II onwards, in the first title you are far from a killing machine: leave the scene and hide is always the best solution, here. Also, no economic or risiko mechanics: very interesting, I won't deny it, but not very fitting to a group of shadows which main purpose is to stealthy eliminate menaces to humanity\n2) Assassin's Creed spots very interesting villains in the Templars, who are mostly portraied as anti-villains and well intentioned extremists. Their final speeches are the main highlight of the game's plot, in my opinion\nSuffice to say, I really think Assassin's Creed the first is the only worthy game of the series this far, with Assassin's Creed III coming very close to give me the same feelings", "hours": 14.0, "username": "Halflight", "products": 185, "early_access": false}

The story takes place in an interesting era and is quite intriguing but sadly a bit forgettable.\nThe combat (apart from the assassinations) is somewhat clunky and you can tell that it's a console port.

I had a lot of fun with the game when it wasn't feeling repetitive. Climbing up to the view points was really fun and a few of them was a little bit challenging, too.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 223, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-02-07", "text": "Assassin\u2019s Creed is a game with lots of cool ideas that ultimately fail to come together cohesively. You just get the feeling that the developers were forced to release whatever they had done for the 2007 holiday season, whether it was ready or not. In that way, it reminds me a lot of the first Mass Effect - lots of great ideas, cool story and universe, but ultimately not as good as it should have been (which, like AC, was mostly rectified with the second game in the series).\nBut first things first... let\u2019s break down what works and what doesn\u2019t. As mentioned above, what works are the ideas the game puts forth, both in terms of story and gameplay. The story centers on a clandestine battle between two orders - the Assassins and the Templars. You play as Desmond Miles, a present-day descendant of Assassins, who has been captured by an organization named Abstergo (the modern day corporate face of the Templars). Using a device called the Animus, Desmond is forced to re-live the memories of his ancestor, an Assassin named Altair, in order to find a mysterious artifact.\nThe game is played from Altair\u2019s point of view and takes place in the cities of Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre, circa 1200. It is here that you can see where the majority of the work was put into the game. The cities are sprawling, alive, and built with tons of detail. You really do almost feel like you could be in those places at that time. It\u2019s quite impressive, technically. Gameplay centers around two main mechanics - free-running and combat. Free-running allows you to run across streets, rooftops and climb buildings in a fluid manner. When it works, it\u2019s great fun, but oftentimes you\u2019ll accidentally fall off buildings or jump in a completely wrong direction or climb something you didn\u2019t want to, etc. Clearly the developers hadn\u2019t worked out all the kinks yet. The combat is interesting, but nothing special. There are lots of options and it looks great in motion, but it\u2019s not particularly difficult or engaging. Simply mashing buttons usually works in most cases. However, you can clearly see the potential in it. So again... good ideas, but not yet implemented as well as they could be.\nWhere the game ultimately fails is in the design. Assassin\u2019s Creed 1 can basically be boiled down to the following: go to a city, climb a few towers, beat up a few people (or some other menial task), assassinate a high-priority target, return to home base. Repeat this 9 times and you\u2019re done. It\u2019s all very tedious and gets boring quickly. While there are a few different types of tasks and side missions that you can do in the cities, none of it really rises above being mediocre. The most interesting parts of each chapter are the final assassinations, but even in these cases, the verdict is mixed. Instead of actually being able to sneak around stealthily and assassinate your targets, many of these encounters just end up turning into a big brawl (not exactly what one would expect in a game involving secret assassins).\nUltimately, the game is promising, but flawed. The ideas underlying the story are definitely cool and the environments are really nice (for their time), but as a game, it is simply average in most respects. It also doesn\u2019t help that the Altair character isn\u2019t terribly compelling and nothing really interesting even happens until the very end. That said, this game is worth checking out if the premise intrigues you and you think you might be interested in the series as a whole (which, for the record, DOES get better). If you think that might be the case, my recommendation would be to either skip this game entirely and watch all of the cut-scenes/ending online, or play through it doing only the barest minimum needed in order to continue.\nGrade: C\nNote: I don\u2019t recommend playing any of the Assassin\u2019s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.", "hours": 23.7, "username": "noibn", "products": 1828, "early_access": false}

Machine called Animus s(t)imulates genetic memories of our hero to put him in shoes of his ancestor, assassin Alta\u00efr ibn-La'Ahad, during times of the Third Crusade.\nThis meta story is definitely one of the highlights of this adventure game. The other being the pretty well executed, smooth freerunning exploration aspect. I also love how the whole Animus business explains lots of acceptable breaks from reality present in video games. But then who will explain the stuff that is going on for Desmond? xD\nI would hesitate though to call this much of \"action\" game or especially \"stealth\" game. It's rather easy, for one, bar maybe the very end and any area that has water as Alta\u00efr can survive falls from some rather jarring heights but can't swim even in a puddle of liquid. But okay, let it be an action adventure.\nFor two, however, regarding the stealth aspect. You're not that much interesting to the guards to begin with and then you simply have one button to make you even less interesting, kind of hiding in plain sight (blending). Once you do garner unhealthy interest what you do is run away, break line of sight and hide in some hay or something, often jumping there from some ridiculous heights.\nExcept you often get this impression it is actually easier and faster to kill dozen of guards rather than to run from them and hide.\nIn short, the stealth aspect is actually barely present and not that all rewarding, especially compared to something I would call \"proper\" stealth like in Dishonored or even Deus Ex: HR or Batman. Not mentioning Thief, of course, that's a given. But I imagine I have to set this expectation for the whole series that this is more about the story, freerunning and mass murder rather than stealth. Not saying it's bad, just bit different from what I originally anticipated.\nArguably the most challenging part is gathering literally hundreds of some flags loitered around, yet it gives you pretty much nothing, there aren't even uplay points or steam achievements for that (on consoles you'd get achievos at least). Sufficient to say I gave up on that portion :] Even creator pretty much agreed he was just trolling players with that.\nAlthough I did execute all the \"side\" missions even if you're required to do only a fraction of them to proceed.\nAh.. the missions.. That's another stab at gameplay. Despite all the open ended nature, it gets pretty repetetive. Maybe that's why they decided not to force all side missions on you.\nOverall I'd still say it is a pretty interesting experience, and even if it didn't exactly meet my expectations it did nicely set off the whole franchise and can't wait to play the next installments.", "hours": 25.2, "username": "Blue Award", "products": 857, "early_access": false}

I desperately wanted to play the first, but the second wouldn't leave me be and ultimately became the experience of this game.\nUbisoft's brand of boring and repetitive combat makes its series debut in AC.  Add to that the three virtually identical main set pieces, and you will be left amazed as I was that so bland a game could come from the hundreds of creative people who had a hand in making this title.  Adding more creativity to the production does not necessarily mean more creativity in the final product to be sure.\nThe tragedy of AC is that underneath all this blandness lies a pretty interesting story of inter-temporal... well... something or other.  The story was obfuscated by the very presentation that was meant to tell it.  I had to youtube the ending and secret story points after beating the game just to see wtf happened.  This obfuscation could have been by design, which is possible as Ubisoft does tend to put the finer points of the game's story into easter eggs to be found by the player.  And maybe that's my fault for not recognizing and engaging that.  But with such a bland gameplay experience, I was left uninterested in anything other than finding something exciting and pulse-pounding about Assassin's Creed, which is ostensibly an action game.  Reading in-game emails and interpreting glyphs on walls would not have qualified as exciting at that point for me.\nThe final and in my opinion unforgivable F-you from Ubisoft is that this game has in effect no ending.  Clearly Ubisoft had intentions to serialize this franchise, which is fine.  But you have to have an ending in the first release of an IP, even if you have a cliffhanger in it as AC did.  The original Halo did it, Star Wars did it.  It's a rule.

The game is built up around assassinations, as you might have guess, but the actual assassination sequences are rather dull, linear and poorly designed and not really worth doing at all. The rest of the gameplay however, the gameplay that's been put in there for no reason other than to claim it's an open world game, is specatular. Running around the cities, jumping from building to building, evading guards is one of the best open world experiences I have had since Prototype.\nYour are put into the shoes of Miles Desmond who, through the magical wonder of a machine called \"The Animus\" get to live the life of his ancestors, or in particular, this one ancestor who happens to be a 12th. century assassin during the crusades. I guess they got lucky when he didn't have to live through the life of that other ancestor that was a 15th. century bar wench.\nThe story gets quite a bit complicated as the life of Miles and his ancestor gets intertwined in a web of conspiracies and ancient secret societies. You know, the usual stuff. It's not a case of bad writing but it does get a little contrived towards the end and the lack of any strong and memorable characters hurts it a lot.\nThe fighting is mostly a case of parry and counter facing numerically superior enemies who are, fortunately for you, quite weak. Learning the tempo to this is quite easy however and you'll get bored quickly with the regular combat.\nThe assassinations, performed mostly with the trademarked \"I cut my finger off for laughs\" hidden blade, are usually a scripted sequence and often involved a chase scene of some sort. It's not particularly interesting and the amount of fighting and running that needs to be done means you'll never really feel like an assassin.\nThe open world is where the action is at, the movement is fluid and quick and the scenery is beautiful. Running around the city being chased by a slew of guards is open world at it's best and I'd recommend the game almost purely on that fact alone.\nWhen it all comes down to it, it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do and succeeds at what it's not.

Ezio's father and two brothers were wrongfully framed for something they didn't do. Enraged, Ezio escapes the city with his sister and mother and seeks revenge against the people who killed his relatives.

{"product_id": "15100", "page": 236, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2012-06-28", "text": "The Good: Amazing story, beautifully created visually and technically, lots of different missions to complete, parkour and crowd system are unique and revolutionary, DirectX 10 looks great\nThe Bad: Some control and clipping issues, extremely repetitive missions, not very diverse visually, crowd simulation gets predictable and repetitive\nNothing is true. Everything is permitted. This is a saying heard throughout Assassin's Creed and it really sticks with you. So does the thick plot that has come to take the game industry by storm as well as one of the greatest game characters of all time: Altair. The plot is actually weird at first because it's a sci-fi story. You are actually Desmond Miles capture by modern world Templars. They stick you in an Animus and use your DNA to access your ancestors memories to find the Piece of Eden which can be used to control people's minds. That one ancestor is Altair set during the crusades. The second story is of Altair who ends up losing his rank and status among the Assassin Brotherhood by failing a mission due to eagerness and stupidity. Your master, Al Mualim, sends on special missions to assassinate key leaders throughout the holy land (Acre, Jerusalem, and Damascus) to keep them from taking the Piece of Eden and using it to win the war.\nAs you can see the plot is very interesting with a lot of twists. How is the game though? You have a huge open world that are full of side missions and hundreds of buildings to climb. Assassin's Creed has a parkour climbing system as well as a puppeteering system. You control each of Altair's limbs in two different states. The \"socially acceptable\" state allows you to use eagle vision which can show enemies and key targets. You can gently push people away from you and this is key because is you're running around the city knocking people over the guards will come after you, and towards the end of the game everyone is highly suspicious of you and just a few people knocked over will have the entire guard on your tail. The third thing is obviously combat, but if you hold down the run button you start climbing buildings, grabbing people to toss them, and jumping around.\nAssassin's Creed really tried to introduce crowd psychology into the game and it works here, but does feel limited. If you climb buildings people will react by stopping and staring and saying things accordingly. If you use ladders people don't mind so much. While using rooftops is faster and keeps you away from most guards you must watch out for guards on rooftops who will shoot you with arrows if you don't get down, kill them, or move away quickly. The climbing works well enough, but there are some controls issues, clipping issues, and other issues with the camera. When Altair is facing a different way then the camera he will jump towards his way instead of the way you're telling him too. Also, if you run around a pole or near a crate he'll start climbing it instead of just jumping over or going around. This can get down right frustrating when you are running away from a dozen guards and trying to find a hiding spot.\nThe game also introduces anonymity via a symbol near your health bar which stays white when no ones suspects you, but will turn yellow when you are watched and flash red when guards are on to you. When it does this get away quickly or kill whomever is watching you. Don't just kill out in the open or people will run around screaming and call guards. Get away from dead bodies quickly because guards will come by and try to find who killed them or citizens will give you away. If you are caught you need to kill all guards after you or hide. To do this you must break their line of sight and the symbol will flash yellow. When it does find a hiding spot quickly before it turns red again. You can hide on benches between people, stacks of hay, in groups of monks praying, or draped boxes on rooftops. Stay there for a few seconds and you will by anonymous again. You can avoid all this chaos by just jogging, staying calm, don't flail around and jump around like a monkey in crowded areas etc.\nThis whole crowd system is really something else and works well, but feels repetitive and predictable because of the recycled sayings, animations, and it always happens the same way. The combat is the same way because while you can gain new abilities it feels like a counter fest. You can attack with a sword or short sword, throw daggers, but most guards always block and you just stand there with the block button held down and wait for someone to attack and then counter which is usually an instant kill. This gets repetitive and the combat isn't as deep as it could be since combos are limited, and animations are repeated often. It does control well and feels smooth so I guess that's better than broken.\nThe most repetitive thing, and the game's biggest flaw, are the constantly repeated missions that repeat dozens and dozens of times. You can save citizens, do some time trial flag gathering missions, escort missions, assassination missions (probably the most fun), interrogation, eavesdropping, pickpocketing, and climbing tall buildings to find view points to put more missions on your map in that area. Sure they are fun at first, but after you have saved the 30th citizen, or climbed the 50th building it gets old and you just want it to end. Some more mission diversity would have been nice.\nWhile its cool to be an assassin, sneaking up behind a guard and shoving a punch dagger in his gut, and then running away while he falls to the ground without anyone suspecting otherwise is satisfying you must look good doing it too. Assassin's Creed looks amazing, even today, and the PC version sports DirectX 10 graphics with some slightly higher resolution textures. The game looks a lot better than console versions and is well worth another play through just for that alone. While the graphics are amazing technically, artistically the game feels very Middle Eastern with a great soundtrack to support that, voice acting, and the whole game feels true to its time. The architecture is great, the clothing, lifestyles, and jobs people do in the game, but it all does kind of look the same with a lot of greys, browns, and whites.\nOverall Assassin's Creed is an amazing experience with a story you will talk about long after you finish the game, great crowd simulation, and the true feeling of being an assassin. If there was some more mission diversity, visual diversity, and smoother controls the game would be perfect. This is a game you can not miss and every gaming fan should play this.\n~Score: 8.5/10", "hours": 11.9, "username": "Ivory_Soul", "products": 400, "early_access": false}

I enjoyed the game totally oblivious to the \"well known facts\" that it is redundant, buggy, too easy, and has a confusing ending. I just bought it, started playing and fell out of reality for a week, and loved every minute of it, except the ending - it was really sad to realise that it was finished and I couldn't play any more.\nI must admit I'm not a \"gamer\", I enjoy games since my childhood, but I do not play them professionally, and I'm more on the intellectual side. I get bored with shallow keyboard-smashing action titles, and more appreciate a solid story and an adventure that allows me to use logic to solve the problem. I've never played games like Assassin's Creed before (were there any?), so I was totally blown away. I found it very similar to the original Prince of Persia from 1990, the same cinematic movement animations, same classic approach to a level-based story progression. One fight was a bit too hard for me, but I generally loved the idea of not dying. Since it was a memory, I could not really die - desynchronisation merely meant I was not doing it right. Psychologically it's somehow easier for me than getting actually killed. This game is much more logical than its sequels - here you live through a genetic memory of an ancestor, and you have to follow it very closely. In the sequels you had much more freedom, you could buy property, get various weapons, heal yourself, dress in fancy clothes through uPlay rewards (sometimes losing a finger), visit same place during a day or night - that really broke the concept of a DNA memory and moved the franchise from a science fiction into a non-science... better said: nonsense-fiction genre.\nI have found the multi-layer matryoshka-like plot, the graphics and Altair so realistic, I was saying sorry to him each time I was clumsy enough to make him fall off a wall :) I don't understand what \"redundancy\" people are talking about. I guess I'm not blessed with a consumer's mind, and to me consistency, integrity of a story is more important than the \"fun value\".\nSo, if anyone hasn't yet played the original Assassin's Creed and makes up his mind by reading my review, I'd say that if you're jumping through the games while chatting to your friends, and you pay no attention to dialogues and story, this one is not for you, and you will be disappointed with it.
