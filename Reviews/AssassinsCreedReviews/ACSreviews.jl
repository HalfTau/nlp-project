I am not even finished with the main story yet because im having so much fun with the side missions and the missions you do for specific characters you meet like alexander graham bell, Karl Marx, Charles dickens, and more.  I am a huge fan of this time period.  I love victorian era and this game is absolutely beautiful.  You get to play as either Evie or her brother Jacob which is awesome.  I love that you get to play two characters and they each have there own charm.  The controls are for the most part pretty good.  the only problem i had at the beginning was the parkour because of the control keys on keyboard i kept climbing things i did not want to climb, but, i did get used to the controls very quickly and now im having no trouble at all.  The recreation of victorian London and its vicinitys like white chapel is gorgeous.   i find myself just looking at the scenery alot throughout the game.  The skills, crafting , and upgrades system is really good as you can upgrade your main characters but also your gang can be upgraded.  The game runs great and i have not experienced any game breaking bugs at all.  The main story is pretty good so far but i havent gotten through it yet to tell how the entire story is.  I love the combat in this game. it feels very smooth to me and once your character is high level you can really kick the butts of multiple enemies at once.  the combat animations for finisher moves are really good too.  i have been playing almost 50 hours now and am not bored in the slightest bit.  I havent played the jack the ripper dlc yet and will update the reviiew once i do, but, im so thrilled that they included something to do with jack the ripper because i think thats just sooooooo cool. ive done some of the crimes dlc and those missions are actually a nice change of pace in the game because you look for clues, interrogate people and solve the crimes.  This definitely is one of the best games in the series and well worth the price.  i can see easily getting 100 plus hours of play out of it.  Overall i rate this as a definite 9/10 right now and that may go up to a 10 after i finish the main story and the jack the ripper dlc.", "hours": 70.5, "user_id": "76561198197123261", "username": "agapewirejewelry", "products": 254, "early_access": false}

If you\u2019re looking for a solid AC game with good mechanics and enjoyable characters this game may be for you. If you\u2019re looking for a game with a deep plot or gameplay that mixes up the franchise you should probably skip this one.\nI will start by stating that I am really enjoying this game. It\u2019s a solid entry to the franchise that will give folks everything they have loved from the older AC games with a little more polish and far better graphics. Where AC bogs down is in its failure to bring anything new to the table.\nBlackflag, by far one of my favorite games of all time, took the AC franchise and revolutionized it by adapting and building upon the preexisting mechanics to create something new and exciting. It tied these mechanics into the core of the gameplay to create a unique environment that was exciting and energetic. Syndicate fails at this, instead stagnating in old concepts and only adding in minor new mechanics that are mostly oriented around speeding up gameplay and fixing playability issues. Items like the hook shot, while fun and useful, are nothing more than an attempt to save players from spending hours scaling buildings that they just have to come back down. Something AC probably should have fixed long ago.\nThe characters in Syndicate are well rounded, unique, and have great report with one another. Unfortunately the detail put into the character development was not put into the plot which can be disjointed and jarring at times. It\u2019s engaging enough to keep me playing but nothing to write home about. It appears that far more thought was put into the side missions then the main story line. I particularly enjoyed the Charles Dickens side quests which were great fun and changed up the atmosphere of the game.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good old AC romp (Unity Excluded of course). It would also be a great starting point for anyone who has never played an AC game and likes open world exploration and unique games mechanics. I doubt it will appeal to folks who know AC and have gotten bored with it. They will be looking for something new and won\u2019t find it here.", "hours": 22.8, "user_id": "76561198009893444", "username": "Wezzor", "products": 1356, "early_access": false}

Many many times. Watch Dogs, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed..so many times...\nBut this time is different. Because this time, Ubisoft has finally done it. Locked the collectibles maps (thats right! MAPS! Plural! there are two sets of collectibles map!) behind a micro-transaction .And the cost has risen since Unity as well, the Helix Points needed this time is 1000 which doesn't come by often in this game.\nIn sum, Ubisoft has made sure that an active part of its already available content is made that much harder to find unless you cough up 10 euros for EACH map. Look, DLC's always been part of the Ubisoft package, but its always have been adding something extra or giving you access to some high level gear early in the game. In this case however, a DLC actively takes away your 100% unless you're willing to comb thru the huge open world for them or stream a video guide on the side. All of which actively takes away all the fun in a game.\nMaybe this is an unfair gripe and some people might say \"yeah, you think all collectibles should appear as blazing neon icons on the map everytime? How privileged are you???\". All fair points. But this is a Ubisoft game.

From the wretched backyards of Whitechapel, the busy, murky Thames to the cosy corners of Westminster with its caroling, it's actually quite diverse imho.\nI liked Evie as a character, more than Jacob, who is rather a gangleader than a real assassin, as she is the one who drives the story forward as the true assassin in this game. Unfortunately the missions where you have to play a set character lean more towards Jacob.\nThe story is rather straight, with very few surprise moments, but the characters good, and the main antagonist's reasoning is actually quite comprehensible. More so than e.g. Cesare in Brotherhood.\nThere is less parcour than in other AC games, as you will find yourself using the rope launcher most often, but it's a good mean to traverse the city or to make a quick getaway.\nThe combat as usual is rather easy, just press E or F in the right moment and you'll never get defeated. But it's fun to see some nice multiple takedown animations.\nI didn't encounter any bugs, aside from mission or train icon disappearing on the map twice, but a fast travel fixed it for me.\nThe Jack the ripper DLC is a nice idea, but not worth it imho.\nAll in all it is one of my favourite AC games, probably right after AC II and Origins, and if you like a darker, industrious, yet atmospherioc setting, and can deal with the usual AC flaws, mainly the wonky controls, it will be a game you'll very much enjoy.", "hours": 84.7, "user_id": "76561198260038853", "username": "rossobianco1895", "products": 14, "early_access": false}

Most of the issues I had with Rogue and Unity have been fixed, loads of improvements have been added. Industrial London is a fantastic and immersive place to explore and the gameplay is loads of fun. This time I actually understood the story and thought it was pretty well done; meeting lots of famous characters of the era along the way. Carriages and the hookshot add much needed new movement tools, cover mechanics are a lot smoother. Excellent all round.\nI really didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to top Black Flag but I was pleasantly surprised by this. I even decided to try and do EVERYTHING. After 40 hours, I\u2019ve just had to stop that as there is SO much stuff to do. I\u2019ve got about 80% completion, but I think this time round there are just way too many collectables. Seriously, aside from the actual missions, there are 680 things to pick up from the map.\nIn terms of performance, this one is still pretty much the same as the others; its quite pretty but it\u2019s badly optimised. I have a GTX1080 and the only way to get more than 60fps was to put things on a mix between High and Very High. Everything turned on ran at about 45fps. There are also frequent freezes while riding carriages (possibly because the game has to load assets more frequently?), and the game crashed about 6 times in my 40 hours.\nThis time round, there are only 3 kinds of weapons, which is probably a good thing. No one was going in to the menu to equip two handed rifles and halberds in Unity, so it\u2019s nicer to have a simpler choice here. They\u2019ve also reduced the number of armour pieces you can wear.\nThe addition of carriages and the hookshot give you more options for getting around London, which I think is a great addition. Some people denounced the addition of a grappling hook but I think it simply makes it more fun and gives you other ways to get around and assassinate people.\nInstead of being able to disguise yourself identically as someone else (which was a bit weird), you can now kidnap NPCs to walk in to restricted areas undetected, which works really well. They\u2019ve also added the ability to dodge bullets again, and added the whistle back in - so hiding is actually functional again. Getting in to cover behind walls is also a lot smoother and happens automatically without having to do an awkward button press.\nCompleted in 42 hours\nFor more reviews, check out my\npage.", "hours": 42.2, "username": "Ishvii", "products": 330, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 8, "page_order": 7, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-12-30", "text": "Assassin's Creed Syndicate, the game everyone was afraid to buy because of the god-awful game known as AC Unity... and after it came out 2 years ago... people still didn't like it, in fact people started to say the AC franchise was dead after it came out (thankfully Origins saved that) but lets see why exactly people hated it so much.\nThe story is about Jacob and Evie Frye, two assassins who go to London to stop Crawford Starrick from oppressing the people of London with gangs and child labour. They meet an Indian Assassin called Henry Green, who takes Evie to the Kenway mansion where they find out that Edward had found an artifact during his days as an Assassin called 'The Shroud of Eden' which Crawford Starrick is also looking for. That makes me wonder... why didn't we just get another game about Edward finding it... making it useful to the series? instead of a pointless game like Unity or Rogue? this plot happens all because of Edward and there's no real lead up to it so... okay then. Using the key and map that Edward left, Evie finds the shroud, but loses it to a Templar called Lucy Thorne. Some random \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 happens, you kill people, start a gang, meet a dog called Desmond (haha funny) and then at some point Ubisoft decide to stop the story and tell you to liberate certain areas of London before proceeding with the story. What a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665way to increase game time. In AC Brotherhood did you have to take town all the Borgia towers before proceeding with the story? no. In AC4 were you stopped to be told to take down all the forts and legendary ships before going into the Observatory? no. So why do it here? these should be optional. You don't have to take them all down but its bloody annoying anyway. It slows down the game and its just boring. After doing this you'll finally face off Starrick, kill him and then the game ends. There's a lot of issues with this story, while I do like how its not trying to be too serious like Unity and just have a simple story, its too simple. Who are Evie and Jacob? whats their backstory? who's Starrick? in the intro Henry Green describes him as \"ruthless as Reginald Birch\" the guy who killed Edward Kenway and honestly, I don't see that. In fact during the entire game you barely see him, he's in a couple of cutscenes sitting behind a desk. Whoop-de-doo. Honestly they try to make him out as this huge evil villain but he's just not, he's not interesting, the Frye twins aren't interesting, nothing is. The story is just forgettable, nothing that pisses me off like Unity did, but just forgettable.\nThe gameplay, I have a serious issue with and I know so many others did too. Why the actual \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 do you have a GRAPPLING GUN like this isn't Batman Arkham City, we don't need to go around doing that. Remember the good old days of climbing up huge towers as Altair, Ezio, Connor, Edward and all those guys? yeah those days are gone. Welcome to 'Batman Arkham City: Victorian London edition'. There's seriously no need to parkour anymore in this game. Its not like its optional either, the city is built for you to grapple across. That's another thing, the city is boring and dull, I mean maybe thats because I live in England so I don't find it interesting but even then, its just not fun at all. Its more lively than AC Unity's cities. Thats for sure, but its nowhere near as good as Firenze or Rome or the West Indies. Also the combat is absolute\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 its not unfair like in AC Unity but they decided to try out a hack 'n slash type of combat. This isn't Samurai Warriors, this is Assassin's Creed. I want to just counter and kill, not mash the X button to kill someone. Thankfully almost every problem in AC Syndicate is fixed in Origins.\nThe PC port... well I have a 1080ti, i7 6700 and 32gb ram and it runs at like 90fps... which isn't really the best considering that AC Origins runs with like 30-40 higher frames than that. This was back when Ubisoft wanted you to have the best\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665possible to run it well.\nAlso the music is forgettable in this game too. A lot of violins, which does fit the Victorian era but its nothing catchy and every track sounds the same, also they re-used Ezio's theme again... obviously...\nWith forgettable characters, a mediocre and forgettable story, music that isn't really good, this AC game just sucks, its not fun, its not bad either. Its just sort of there, if there's a game like AC Syndicate that I could recommend, its the Batman Arkham games... or actually y'know what? just get a different Assassin's Creed game. AC1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Black Flag and Origins handle stuff in this game far better.

They tried adding a cool new mechanic with two playable characters, but unfortunatly the character development is garbage. I dont know why they would challenge themselves in trying to make two interesting characters, when they cant even handle one. Gameplay wise, its same old \"ubisoft clear map objectives\" type of game, only this time you clear buroughs and make them your own. The first few times this is exciting and cool, but then you repeat the same thing over and over again, same gameplay and the same damn annoying speech at the end. This game is fun for a couple of hours and then grows stale.\nAlso, the best gear you can get in the game is the ones that are unlockable by either pre-ordering or buying a DLC. So if you actually have that gear, you never have to upgrade and a huge amount of the games item mechanics go unused.

Whilst one street or courtyard looks nice it also looks the same as the next.\nAs a Londoner I feel simultaneously at home with the streets but also irritated by the myriad of inaccuracies and ridiculous stereotypes. As well as the fact my native borough apparently has about 30 houses in it. In fact the size generally annoys me.\nIt's also fairly buggy with respect to getting caught on stuff or difficulty targeting enemies during fights, and personally I sometimes find the climbing controls annoying.\nSo onto the less negative stuff:\nThe lighting and weather effects can combine really well, the sight of a foggy gaslit street at night is lovely.\nI really liked the detective DLC, felt better than all the investigating stuff in arkham / witcher games.\nJumping between boats, trains and carriages is quite fun.\nThe grappling hook is a massive time saver and adds to the general silliness of everything.\nStory missions are actually not that bad and I liked both the twins acting and their interactions.\nHas a pantomime villain with a fantastic moustache.\nVerdict:\nI don't think this is a good game, its uninspired buggy and repetitive. Despite all this I still enjoy making a big cuppa tea, listening to something more interesting and jumping about the rooftops of victorian London with a grappling hook and revolver in the rain.

Syndicate stars twins Jacob and Evie Frye set in Victorian London. As always with AC games, the world is beautiful and feels alive. The Frye twins are interesting protagonists and the game play aspect of being able to switch between characters for a slightly different play style is a nice change.\nUnfortunately Syndicate also shares some similar problems as previous AC installments, namely repetition. The world map is filled with side missions and collectibles, alas most of them are pretty much the same and once you've collected a few vintage beer bottles or pressed flowers there's not much fun in finding more, unless you want to try different color schemes for your outfits in the crafting menu.\nSpeaking of crafting, the crafting system has been expanded this time around and you'll be able to craft new and more powerful weapons and armor which is a nice addition to the game. Skills and perks have been improved as well but at only 10 levels max it won't take you that long to reach the highest level.\nSome side missions will have you encounter famous people from the Victorian era but game play wise these missions don't do anything new. The main missions do provide alternate ways of completing objectives, which is nice but in the end I found that it just didn't provide enough entertainment to revisit.\nAs with most AC games, don't expect great optimization or a steady frame rate and be prepared to struggle with numerous bugs and graphical glitches, though it's certainly not as bad as AC: Unity.\nIf you're a fan of the AC series then Syndicate is worth picking up.

Its no wonder they went for the reboot option following this title. How to drop the ball 101.\nThis is a bog standard Assassins Creed game with all the usual guff, smoke bombs, darts, ranged weapon, melee combat weapon. For some reason you also manage to loot Batman's personal stash and get hold of the Bat Grapnel as well.\nThe game plods along with a meh plot set in London. It seems like the creators wanted something of Gangs of New York meets Marry Poppins. The ideas are correct but London itself is uninspiring and one dimensional. I couldnt have really told you the poor parts from the rich parts even being a Historian and a resident of the United Kingdom. In short it all melded together. The gang fight missions were nice but you had to troil through the usual assassins creed missions first. In this case its assassination, kidnap and rescue. *Yawn* In most cases I did a mission if I strayed towards it but ignored it and did my usual fast travel method of Assasins Creed map movement.\nCombat was pretty dismal as well, there are 3 weapons to choose from and the \"dynamic\" combat really boiled down to bash attack, dodge or quick shot when need to and stun the guy when he blocks. Gone are the timed counters from previous games. The was little timing or skill involved and I quickly found myself able to take out multiple opponents above my level with the sneaky character much less the combat wombat. Combat felt very forced and more of a button bash that it did in previous titles. The weapons available were also very un-inspiring a Knife, Knuckle dusters and a Sword Caine. I stuck with a Knife the entire game because the graphics of the others simply seemed a bit lame. There were the usual multiple kill options in combat but I think the game rolls a dice to decide if you execute this ability, sometimes it happened others it didnt.\nFree running has always been a staple of Assassins Creed, in this title you now hold A to go up and X to go down. Sure if I wanted to skill jump parkour Id play Mirrors Edge, but this still feels like it takes all the flow and control away from you. To make matters worse the pre mentioned Bat Grapnel means you can fly about like Batman, instead of climbing a building one aimed shot can take you right to the top. Sure you move quicker but it just takes away the whole point and feel of Assassins Creed.\nThe game only uses four types of bad guy which sucked big time. Gang members, Guards, Templars and Police.  Gone are the patrols of guards led by a captain or the guy with the big weapon etc. Again you button bash your way past these guys like you were... hmmm yes Batman.\nThe targets are also badly thought out, I will conceed the final bad guy Crawford Starrick has bags of bad guy charisma even if the final confrontation with him is more like a poorly thought out mini game than an actual finale.To top this off you even have a very predictable Bill the Butcher style guy leading the red enemy gang and he was voiced by Captain Jack Sparrow. *sigh*\nI wanted to like Evie and Jacob Frye but both were quite one dimensional characters one violent the other sneaky *predictable*.\nI really wanted to love this title but found the story pretty non existant. My usual too many weapons gripe was met with a not enough weapons complaint and I honestly couldnt wait for this to be over. The future / modern parts of the story were also lost to me and just served in wasting time, it doesnt fit what so ever and lets not even visit the World War I time line missions. Its as if a dev said \"oh oh London lets cram everything we can in\" That said Jack the Ripper DLC ( didnt bother) should have been part and parcel of the game although it was nice to see Spring Heeled Jack, although the game made no attempt to really explain this. So much potential in a historic and fine city lost.\nIf your a AC fan then go ahead and play this title but I wouldnt suggest getting it outside of a sale, if you havent played AC before avoid this one and play an earlier title you will find it much more satisfying!\nAdditional, having finished this title I decided to go back and play Assassins Creed 3 again. Can confirm there is more storyline and RP aspect in the first hour of gameplay than Syndicate's entire title.

The control system in this game completely destroys the game, I mean it breaks it completely for me. I haven't been this infuriated and frustrated since I played \"Primal Rage\" on the SNES when I was like 12.\nSome examples would be, when your navigating a building face and want to climb up, dependant on the camera angle you will either jump sideways when you want to climb or you will scale down the building when you want to go sideways. I've also noticed that if you want to go into a small gap where say your objective is with a wall either side of it, the character will snap to the top of the wall on either side, unless you walk slowly into it. Obviously when your hurrying its annoying. I've also noticed a fair amount of bugs despite this game having been out for nearly 2 years now, NPC's falling through the floor on the train and spawning at wierd angles occassionally.\nAs london is tightly packed in some areas, the character is constantly snapping to walls or jumping up onto things when you don't want them too. I couldn't possibly imagine what would happen if they set this game in modern day Tokyo, I think every blood vessel in my head would explode!!\nIf your a die hard Assassins creed fan, fine stick it out, the story is good and I like the characters, theres lots of famous historical figures in this game also.\nI played assassins creed 1, 2, 3 and 4 and some of the add ons, I remember 4 being just as bad, but there was plenty of open area for the character to \"Faff\" around without causing to much rage. However I dont remember 1 2 and 3 being this bad although still not great.\nI was going to buy the other older assassins creed's (Chronicles series etc) Not a bloody chance in hell!!!

The last Maharaja was OK\n+ Well worth the money if its around or below 20 EUR\nCons:\n- the story is very forgetable and the storytelling is somewhat grey\n- I personally couldnt care less about the gang aspect of it, you might enjoy it tho, but being an AC game you wanna handle yourself alone if you are like me\n- The borough activities are a bit boring after a while\n- no modern-day gameplay, and the modern-day story is almost non-existent\nAll together, it is a very good AC game, and an excellent game in general.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 15, "page_order": 1, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-11-26", "text": "So I played the entire game start to finish PLUS the DLC. In short, I don't recommend it. Why? I 100% complete the game and it is so repetitive that, you're already tired of the franchise recyling stuff then you see this game take it to the next level.\nThe Pros: Game runs perfectly fine. The stealth mechanic was vastly improved from the absolute crap that was in Unity where ever enemy had SOP (from MGS4) where they could react based on another teammates response (just like 5 paths of pain). Everyone in Unity was high on 500mg of Caffiene. The moment you threw something or ran from side to side they'd instantly be alerted and the SOP system would kick in and EVREYONE in the entire area would know exactly where you were, no questions asked. Thankfully thats been fixed and made the stealth in this game less annoying.\nThe Cons: Man... seroiusly... When they were making and play testing this game.. Didn't they ever say, \"Hmm... this is so boring and complete trash!\"???? The story here is explained in the first 30 mins of the game. London is heavily occupied by Templar control, Jacob and Evie want to fix it. Jacob focuses on killing targets - just like any AC game. While Evie focuses on ONE piece of eden and fixes Jacob's mistakes. Thats it. The villian was by far the weakest in any AC game. He was so tired of this franchise and the game itself that he didn't do anything throughout the ENTIRE GAME. So the story, and main villian were absolute garbage but what about the rest? Well... Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, right? That's all it is. You'll be going around London doing the same crap for the entirety of the game. In the main game you're either doing fight clubs which consists of the same thing multiple times to gain someones loyalty to maximum, or you're kidnapping gang members and handing them over to the cops, or you're stealing carriages carrying supplies, or you're stealing\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off boats, or you're freeing children from cleaning the floors, or you're going into gang strongholds and just killing the leader/enemies. Thats it. You'll be doing this MULTIPLE times. I don't know why they don't get a small like maybe 10 man team and have them develop different, distinct side missions. It can't be that hard. To make matters worse the combat is by far the worst and least enjoyable in any AC game. Sure, some of the kill animations can look cool but other than that its just button mashing. I used the mouse+Keybaord for this entire game and it was all about clicking away. Here's how you become a pro at the combat in this game. JUST STARE AT THE ENEMIES HEALTH BAR. When its red, keep clicking, when its yellow, quickly press E, when its grey, hit space bar. thats it. you've mastered it if you can respond to different colors. The DLC does add new combat mechanic called Fear. Which is cool cuz it was in the main game but to a lesser degree (if you killed someone via execution, sometimes enemies would run away in fear). The DLC was heavily based on fear and added 2 new weapons which make no real sense but whatever. As for the side missions in the DLC Jack the Ripper, they were also repetitive. You're either saving a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 from a carraige, or you're stopping a guy hurting a woman then shaming him through the alley without being detected (very annoying btw), or your escorting a carriage WHILE DRIVING IT REALLY SLOW + no crashing to a destination point, or you're tailing someone then scaring them, or you're going into a fight club and just beating everyone up like before (or you can scare them all away). Yes there are new thigns added but they are new things that must be done multiple times which makes it become really old and stupid so fast. You literally don't have to think much in this game. Just follow the map. That's all it is. Also there are side objectives during missions like \"don't get detected\" which is good and can add challenege however; i found myself constantly having to replay some missions because I didn't realize that I wasn't supposed to kill anyone or not go below 30m. The game doesn't warn you about a new side objective coming up within a mission until you're already into it. Which can be irrititating since the game is already really annoying to play.\nLets talk about the Presentation of the game. There is some serious issues here. Firstly i must recommend you play with SweetFX profile. Why? because the game is a soft mess even without any AA. I downloaded some SweetFX profile and changed the vignette to as low as possible and upped the sharpness to 2.00 because the games overall presentation is really soft. If you enable any kind of AA in the game, the image only gets softer. Why? because Ubisoft for some reason thought it would be a good idea to have FXAA or FXAA + MSAA/TXAA which makes the screen look like you put vaseline all over it. Secondly, I was recently playing witcher 3 @1080p with no AA and the game looked absolutely fine. However the amount of shimmering and jaggies in this game are RIDICULOUS. Theres so much of it that i just don't understand how this can be.... Next, the enemies. Seriously... They ALL LOOK THE SAME. weather they are your allies, your targets, or just random people. THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. You'll have a Rook on your team that'll look exactly the same as the Blighter you're supposed to kidnap. Extreme laziness at its best. Sure, other games have had this same issue. But in AC Syndicate, when your main target looks exactly like the last one, it shows. IT REALLY SHOWS. If this was a 3DS game I wouldn't care as much. In AC1 every target had a different face. In this game only select targets have different faces. I don't know man this game could have been really good but if I have to point my finger at ONE thing that could have caused this game to be so crap, it would be that its annualized. A game like this should come out once ever 2-3 years so ideas are refreshed and not recycled. And thats a fact. This game shows that. AC4 was amazing. Completely different and fun. Sure not everyone liked sailing, but you have to give credit where credit is due and that game brought new ideas changing things up a bit. This game however; just tries to recycle some of the good from the past games just to make a game. Thats it. There is a new thing added to this game and thats the Rope Launcher. At first I thought it was pretty cool but then some great immersion breaking things pop up. I wouldn't have minded if the Rope Launcher was used to scale up and down buildings quickly, however; you can clearly see that you're firing an infinite number of ropes, sliding across them, then leaving them. and doing the same thing over and over. That to me is very immersion breaking. and I know why the rope launcher is in the game. Because of the way London is. To get from rooftop on one side of the street to the other is nearly impossible because of the gaps. I wish this game wasn't made in London because of that. It is so annoying chasing targets on the street or on the rooftops. Extremely annoying era. I think it could have been much better in China, or India where homes are compact and close together. Aside from that the last thing that I didn't like was the way the Jack the Ripper DLC was presented. It's shown through the Animus..... You play as 3 different characters... How? Once you play it you'll understand what I mean. But immersion breaking things are present there too.\nOverall; game ran fine but is extremely repetitive. Story is nearly absent in the main campaign and the Jack the Ripper DLC has slightly better story but thats about it. Side objectives lacked any kind of creativity. London could have been better explored and utilized but I feel like they missed a good opportunity. I bought this on sale and if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed, I suggest you buy it on sale too if you have to play it. It's probably my least liked Assassin's Creed game.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 16, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-11-24", "text": "All AC predecesors have tried (and in quite a few cases FAILED) but they at least TRIED to reinvent the wheel. Even one-off titles like AC Rogue and side-games at least TRIED to do something different. Even the ABYSMAL wreck of YUCK that was AC Unity - even the enjoyable but ultimately miss-guided mess that was AC3 - hell, even the PSP AC titles have at least TRIED to do something new - granted; most of those ultimately failed. But they tried - and I was WILLING to finish AC UNITY to say that I had - to justify the money I spent on it... this game? Not so much... throughout your ENITRE experience you will feel you've either seen this - done that - been here - seen that - and it wears on you. I didn't want to finish this game - not even to say I HAVE finished it. Not because I hate it - but because, quite simply, I don't care.\nFirst up, the story... there... really isn't one. Not really. Criminal warlord is holding England in his grip - really? THAT'S what we're doing? We're not trying to save cultures or protect the world... we're doing street crime? From the get-go this is a problem; who CARES about random punks on the street? I mean, seriously, in ALL the previous AC games - thugs were just ONE part of what you'd encounter in the game. In this game? 80% of what you're fighting are THUGS. Best part? You're not even trying to beat them - you just want to take over. You're a criminal but a nice criminal - a dashing criminal - the criminal that England deserves... ugh. Even AC4 acknowledged that pirates sucked :P this game? You might as well be modern robin hood... with random extras - because, outside of like ONE character, there aren't any merry men to cozy up to or admire. It's really just the main characters with the OCCASIONAL appearance by the moderately interesting Henry...\nTalking of the main characters...\nWith a story like that, you're going to be pretty reliant on the main characters - and, yes, it's characters... you play two characters. Now, AC has done female leads - they've done (predominantly) male leads - but they HAVE done female leads before. Evie's writing is top notch - her character is interesting - her story is good - her interactions with Henry (an assassin who cares too much and is afraid to kill - that's actually quite an interesting trait for a top-secret murder cult) her love for the people around her - it's good... unfortunately, only about 50 percent of the game (and, really, 40 percent... and, after spending time with Jacob, it'll feel like \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing 30 or 20 percent...) is spent with Evie. The rest of the time you've got Jacob... do you remember Edward Kenway? Probably the MOST dickish main character in the history of AC? Yeah... Jacob is Edward with all the charm and witty banter thrown out. He's an idiot. He's a prick. He's selfish. The main story starts with him talking his sister into going to London by telling her about some lost artifact - but the minute they get there all he cares about is becoming the next kingpin. People die - a LOT of people die - children get sick - factories burn down - the best part? Most of Evie's story - when she isn't focusing on the much more interesting hunt for the artifact - focuses around cleaning up Jacob's messes. Literally. He poisons a bunch of kids - Evie fixes it. He lets a bunch of counter-fitters loose on England - Evie fixes it. He teams up with a manipulative\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665who SCREAMS villain - leading to him almost blowing up several workhouses - Evie fixes THAT too.\nHe's an idiot - he deserves to die - and you're saddled with him for most of the game. A game with a story that is focused around running around England blowing\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665up, kidnapping people and saving the odd kid. All so you can control the ultimate criminal empire. We've been here - we've done this - and we've done it with characters we've actually cared about. With much higher stakes. Even characters you COULD care about - Evie - Henry - are side-lined for Jacob and his selfish stupidity. Eventually, it gets to the point, where you don't even care about the bonus content anymore - you don't even care about the side missions - you just want this done so you NEVER have to see Jacob's stupid face again...\nWhich wouldn't be so bad - if there was actual new content here worth playing.\nWe've ridden things in AC before - boats - chariots - horses - we've done this. Trains- wait? We get a train? Hell YEAH! Okay. I'mma name my train Thomas and... oh, what's this? This engineer girl person get's to take care of the train for me? That's nice. I wouldn't want Thomas to go uncared for - so I'll just climb into the front and... ... ... wait... let me... if you'll just...\nOkay, back up a minute, I've driven boats, chariots and horses - the one new idea - the ONE new piece of content - a MOBILE rail-bound base - and I DON'T \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING GET TO DRIVE IT?!?!?!? That's right folks - you don't have a hub in this game. You have a train. But you don't drive it. No joke - I'm not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you. You can't decorate it. You can't color it. You can't have epic train battles. Half the time you can't even FIND the bloody thing because it's chugging off GOD NOWS WHERE. They had to put in a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing fast travel feature just so you could GO to the damn thing because the engineer girl is off god-knows-where doing god-knows-what with my beloved Thomas!!!\nahem - I think I'm okay now...\nSo what other content is there in this game? Remarkably little... there's no hunting or gathering - all crafting material is found from boxes. Which are EVERYWHERE now. You can't go a step without tripping over a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing box. There are costumes and outfits based on previous characters and recolors of the game's main characters base outfits; but most of them are bound to the story, the boring as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 side-missions or the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing Uplay interface. There ARE historical encounters - but unlike previous installments they play very little (to no) part in the main story... mostly because, again, there isn't one. Charles Dickens, Darwin, Karl Marx... yeah, see, here's the thing - these appearances should have impacted the main characters. The only one who comes even CLOSE is Alexander Bell; who invents early EMP's and the Bat-Grappler.\nNo\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665- again - I'm not just jerking you around. He invents low-powered EMP's and a bat-grappler and removes most of the best poisons and dart types from the game. I know that the devs were trying to go for a steampunk feel - but when you REMOVE variations on darts and throw in EMP's just so you can \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing rip off the DC game that ripped YOU off... there's a problem.\nFinally, we come to the combat - probably my biggest problem. You've got three weapons to choose from. Brass knuckles. Cane-Swords and Kukri's. Gone are the wide spears or longswords; in their place you've got all these close-together brawling fights that make it VERY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing hard to see ANYTHING if there's trees or a wall or if the camera gets stuck. Worse still; they copied the BIGGEST mistake AC Unity made and gave EVERYONE a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING GUN. Seriously. EVERYONE has a gun. You will be shot. A lot. That doesn't change things up - that doesn't make it more difficult - it's just ANNOYING!!! Which means you spam smoke bombs - a LOT of smoke bombs. How is combat more intense - how is it more involving - if you're FORCED to use the same strategy over any over?\nNow, having said all that, you would THINK that I'd not recommend this game - I DO recommend it... but only to fans. And only on sale. Why do I recommend it? Is it JUST because it's a more modern take on the AC IP? Is it JUST because it's not as HORIFICALLY bad as AC Unity? Is it beause I watched WAY too much Sherlocke Holmes? Well... basically, yes. It ticks the right boxes for an AC fan - the victorian steampunk motif is at least interesting. There's a lot of interesting lore - there's the usual post-AC Rogue tropes - there's a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing ton of boring-but-distracting things to collect. It's an AC game... but that's ALL it is.", "hours": 41.8, "user_id": "76561198054510467", "username": "shadowfaxe7", "products": 94, "found_funny": 18, "early_access": false}

This is the first time the series goes to London and at a relatively modern time during Victorian England and the Industrial Revolution. The city itself is very beautiful, in a sort of smoggy, crowded, and dirty way, but it certainly has its own charm. It includes many real life historical sites like Buckingham Palace where you can fight the Queen's Guard with their ridiculous hats, to the Thames River, to Big Ben, etc. Performance is solid as can be for an AC game, hitting a solid 60 fps with minimal crashes. Would still like to see better ports in the future.\nAs for the story, Evie and Jacob are certainly 2 interesting characters and the ability to switch between them at will except for some missions can be fun although the combat differences in my experience are fairly minimal. There's an obvious attempt to make Evie the more stealthy one and Jacob the more brash, aggressive one but since the combat is only slightly better than the previous counter and attack button mashing so either one is more than capable of taking an entire gang on. The actual story is mediocre at best, although there are some interesting historical characters Karl Marx and Charles Dickens for side missions, but the main story's villain and overall storyline is average at best, even though Evie and Jacob are fairly likable. At least the modern segments have been reduced to cutscenes.\nThe side missions mainly consist of reducing rival gangs' strongholds and such and are fairly repetitive although there are now level scalings for enemies so it isn't always a cakewalk (until a certain point anyways). The DLC except for the Jack the Ripper one which is excellent range from bare bones to average, so whether the Gold edition is worth it or not is up to you. Overall, a decent AC game that runs well and tries to innovate with some combat improvements and 2 protagonists, but the lackluster story and activities combined with the still stale combat system means that unless you are a fan, I would wait until a sale of some sort.\n7/10", "hours": 32.0, "username": "dav93", "products": 66, "early_access": false}

Still, I managed to have some fun out of a dozen crashes (on PC AND PS4, final build) and game-breaking bugs that I yelled and rolled my eyes at. The revamped combat system was fun in the first frew hours, but it became a chore after I realized smashing buttons works just as well, if not better. The leveling system is okay, but it lacked the genuine \"sense of pride and accomplishment\" that is essential to such systems. In Syndicate, it's almost impossible to NOT reach level 10 if you follow the storyline and do some side quests, which have very limited in variety and bore you quickly.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 19, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-11-19", "text": "I find the most entertaining thing about this game to be the glitches. It's not the best in the series but it certainly isn't the worst.\nThe missions are interesting in AC for the first time in a long while. The characters however are pretty boring except for the smartass male protagonist who essentially is trying to be a clone of Nathan Drake from the Uncharted series. They threw in a trans gender character for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I'm totally fine with them adding a trans character but it has to make sense to the setting or the story. Nobody mentions it, random characters on the streets don't seem to be phased by it, nothing. The game takes place in 1868 London, a time period when women had no rights and were treated incredibly poorly. The game always seems to pride itself on historical accuracy and then goes an does this. I'd much rather the character exist, but has to hide or take jeers from other citizens while in public or something along those lines, to show what life would have been like for a transgendered person in that era, but no. Everybody ignores it and the character just exists to pander to a wider audience.\nThe actual story, from what that I've bothered to play of it, seems moderately uninteresting. The only time that I found myself actually wanting to play the missions is when I'm bored of freeroaming and want a giant cinematic setpiece, which the story missions have plenty of and are very well done. I can't comment on the entirety of the story as it hasn't been able to hold my interest long enough to play it.\nThe city itself is fantastic. It feels alive and vibrant, it looks gorgeous from a graphical standpoint and an aesthetic standpoint, my only complaint are the sheer amount of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing chimney's in some neighborhoods. I get that they existed, I get that the time period called for most buildings to have one but FFS they make freerunning on the rooftops a chore instead of a fun method of traversal. If you're going to have a trans character that everybody unanimously accepts in a time period when it wasn't acceptable, the least you can do is remove a few god damn chimneys for the sake of gameplay. The chimney's become LESS of a problem after unlocking the zipline but they're still quite a hindrance. The zipline and grappling hook are a great new addition and are a blast to use.\nThe game is buggy as hell but in the good way. Every single time this game has bugged out on me, it's left me crying from laughter. There was one single instance where a glitch caused me to fail a mission but it still happened in such a way that I couldn't help but chuckle.\nAs far as optimization goes, it seems fairly stable and looks good on my slightly older system. Framerate dips are to be expected with how dense and well rendered the city is. I'm glad I haven't run into any issues with it so far because the last AC game I owned (Black Flag) kept screwing up my saves and Ubisoft support was... Less than sympathetic. They kept blaming my computer, I sent them error logs showing them that it was the game not saving properly at which point they said, and this is a real quote, \"Your ISP (internet service provider) is blocking vital signals. I can tell from my end that none of the problems you are facing can be fixed by us\". Keep in mind that it took them over 2 months to open the support ticket and then they'd respond once a week or every other week after that, just to tell me to screw off.\nTLDR: I have mixed feelings about Syndicate. I want to like it, it makes me laugh when I play it, I can't honestly say that I've had a bad time with it. However I don't know how to rate it. I got it on sale for $15 which is what I feel is about right for the actual content that I've used. I absolutely won't recommend this game for anything higher than 25 dollars. It just doesn't keep me entertained long enough to justify a price that high.\nOverall I think I'm going to have to give the games a recommendation when it comes on sale, but not for full price. If the game doesn't work for you for ANY reason, refund it immediately because Ubisoft support will not help you.", "hours": 13.0, "username": "Chotato", "products": 243, "early_access": false}

Those should not be ever included in the game, they are too simple and too boring.\nNot to mention frequent crashes in random moments. But this is my experience, might be specific to my machine.\nOn the positive side, good graphics and a lot of historical (or made up) knowledge that you can find. But it feels like that's not nearly enough for the AC series title.

Saying it's better than Unity isn't saying much, as true as it is, because Unity was a barely functional tech demo. Syndicate used the same tech, and proceeded to do nothing with it.\nHow to describe this game? Confused. Disjointed. Aimless. Hesitant. All of these words pretty much sum up the experience. It feels a lot like the Yakuza series or GTA4, in that we've reached the point where the game seems uncomfortable with the fact that the main characters are assassins. It also feels like they had no idea what to do with the setting, in that it spends most of its time shamelessly ripping off other game concepts. From the gang takeovers from Saint's Row, to the grappling hook from Batman, to the carriage stealing/racing from GTA, the fact is the game simply has no identity on it's own. It's as if the game is ashamed of the fact that it's about Assassins.\nThis game feels a lot like Revelations, in that it feels like the game has simply run out of ideas of what to do. It's also why the series took a year off after this, and it's clear why, because this game is the same way that London is in this game, a burnt out husk.\nIt's bland in every sense of the word, taking from every other successful series, and not really doing enough to be unique or interesting.

Excellent story, interest and challenging missions - from various conquering activities to the extremely enjoyable Dreadful Crimes. The twins are very different which leads to very different experiences depending on who you are playing. Almost every mission can be completed however you like - subtle or loud - and there is enormous variety in the locales, using people or the environment itself to your advantage, that the choices for how to complete each is endless. This game offers a great deal of freedom to play as you like, which I thoroughly approve of.\nI also enjoy how many of the buildings are accessible - many buildings are just open and you can explore as much as you want - e.g. this includes Buckingham Palace.\nThe gang mechanic is excellent with a large variety of upgrades which mean you can recruit your gang members and issue orders.\nThere are some very unusual questlines - help Charles Dickens solve supernatural mysteries, help Darwin defend evolution, help Marx with worker rights etc. You meet a list of familiar names including Queen Victoria and Arthur Conan Doyle. Very entertaining.\nTraversing London is a joy - go by the charming carriages or go via the rooftops with the excellent zipline. London is a delight - just beautiful with an enormous amount of places to explore. The entire game is just beautiful but London proves an exceptional backdrop - so varied, everything from ugly factories to sprawling parks.\nMy only mild complaint is the stealth is 'sticky' stealth, as in you automatically stick to any vertical object you are near which can be frustrating - try creeping down a hallway, avoiding guards and constantly having to 'unstick' yourself from the wall. It's a minor gripe and isn't enough to get in the way most of the time.\nIt does have some minor glitches, I only had three which were severe but a restart cleared all of them. The others were very minor visual glitches, e.g. someone sitting on a bench but a few feet too far forward.\nThe game is extremely enjoyable and doesn't outstay it's welcome - there is plenty to do but most of it is optional and you can play as much or as little as you want. The modern day sections are short but interesting, rather focused on the much more interesting historical sections.\nThere's even a fascinating World War I section where you play as a descendent of the Frye's. This actually gives you a lot of information about the precursor race, straight from the horse's mouth.\nAll in all, excellent. This was my first Assassin's Creed game and I enjoyed it enough that I will play the other games in the series.", "hours": 59.7, "user_id": "76561198264283196", "username": "emma-a", "products": 305, "early_access": false}

From exciting side missions to creative plot twists within in the main storyline, this game delivered. In fact, it's almost as good as Black Flag and III.\nThey captured the spirit of London beautifully. It felt like I was really there, scaling Big Ben, sneaking into Buckingham Palace, swimming across the Thames. Although you cannot leave London, the map is rather large and there are plenty of cool places to explore. Like previous AC titles, the map is divided into bouroughs. As you progress through the game, you complete side missions (such as liberating children from factories, asssinating templars, or kidnapping templars). When you complete all the side missions in the burough, you will be challenged to a fight with the gangleader of that burough, As always, the side missions were one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game for me. I completed them and liberated all of the buroughs long before I even finished the storyline. Additionally, there are also heists and sabotage missions. They're SO much fun and they're the quickest way to make money.\nAs for the storyline itself, it wasn't the series' most compelling, but I enjoyed it. I liked the sibling rivalry between Jacob and Evie, and it was cool being able to play as two different assassins. Evie was by far the most interesting between the two, and her stealth abilities quickly made her my favorite. Jacob is more of a brawler type of assassin, which is cool for those who prefer that gameplay style. But I didn't enjoy his missions quite as much, simply because I missed Evie's special skills. The character development could've been better, but considering the length of the game, I think the developer's did the best they could with an additional protagonist to write for. It didn't quite compare to previous character development (think: Ezio, Connor, Edward, etc), but it was satisfactory. In my opinion, it would've been a better storyline if they were able to focus exclusively on either Evie or Jacob, but then again, each of them brought something special to the game... so it's hard to say.\nThe questline was really fun. I loved being the leader of the Rooks, and upgrading my gang. The templar missions were exciting as well. The game focused heavily on the politics of the Industrial Revolution, and tied together wonderfully with all the missions. At one point, you get to visit Edward Kenway's mansion. I loved how they not only acknowledged Edward's legacy, but also gave us another glimpse into his life. That was one of the most special moments of the game for me.\nThe gear was a lot of stuff we've seen in previous AC titles. There's the pistol, throwing knives, hallucinogenic darts, smoke bombs, and something new: voltaic bombs. Then there's the grappling hook, which is entirely new as well. A lot of people disliked the grappling hook, but I really liked it. Maybe because I'm lazy, I don't know. But it made for quicker getaways, which in turn made for easier missions. The verdict? If you like it, it'll be your new best friend. If not, then you can choose to stick to parkour if you want. Oh and I can't forget the carriages! Horses are back, but with a new twist: pulling carriages and carts. They're easy to control, and add another layer of excitement to the game. Not only are they an additional mode of transportation, they also provide a quick hiding spot in the streets - not just for Evie or Jacob, but also for hiding templar bodies.\nIt was slightly glitchy, but only in the mechanics. Sometimes it was difficult to get the character to move in the direction you intended, but not enough to significantly impact gameplay.\nThat said, the combat was a clear improvement from older titles. Combat motions were fluid, yet seemingly more diverse than in the past. Opponents have varying fighting techniques depending on their classification, which keeps things fresh and exciting. The only major complaint I have is that the final boss fight was awful. Without spoiling it, all I can really say is that it was annoying and repetitive. While that was disappointing, there were plenty of other templar takedowns that were well constructed. So all in all, it's not that big of a deal.\nThe music was hauntingly beautiful, and fit in perfectly with the setting. It wasn't nearly as memorable as previous soundtracks (to this day, I still get III stuck in my head occasionally), but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe it's less memorable because it blended in with the time period so well?\nOne thing I am EXCEPPTIONALLY happy about, is just how little of the game was wasted in the present day! In all the previous games, I HATED the present day gameplay. But I'm very happy to report that in Syndicate, only about 5 minutes (out of what, 50 hours of gameplay?) are wasted on the present day. Thank you, Ubisoft!\nAll in all, Syndicate was a great game! I'm very happy to have played it, and do see myself playing it again in the future.

It is your traditional Assassin's Creed game, does't change much in terms of mechanics besides the addition of the grapling hook. Although not required, using the grapling hook does make it easier to travel across the city.\nThe story is pretty mediocre, but still quite enjoyable. The one thing that I have always had a problem with is the way the Assassin's Creed games take you out of the world and into modern times. If you are like me and don't much care for the modern story, then you'll be glad to know that this game keeps it to a minimum. There is a few cutscenes but no gameplay during modern times. No need to walk around the Abstergo Lab doing repetitive mini games in order to progress the story.\nOverall, if you take your time playing through the main story without doing any of the side quest such as freeing the boroughs, the game is roughly 20 hours.

First of all, I can see how this game has been improving gameplay wise, it is completely evolved into something new and most of these changes are in the right direction. One thing about this game is that climbing just doesn't feel as fast as before, I don't know why, could be just me. Movement in this game is absolutely lovely, mechanics are really good. There are a few things about combat, it may have changed a bit but you can still counter and kill an enemy and sometimes when 2 of them are attacking at once you can't time the second block right. This game also builds on the ship upgrade system that Black Flag had, but instead you upgrade your gang, your gear and your skills. Talking about skills, the first skill you should aim is the skill that makes bad guys not triggered 24/7. It is like heaven after unlocking that skill. Two characters are built amazingly and the idea is really good but I found the overall story a bit lackluster and I think that it is a bit too \"jumpy\" at times where I couldn't really make a sensible connection, instead it \"just happened that way\". The map is divided into few parts and conquering these is really fun, even though it seemed like the same thing over and over again at the beginning, in the end I realized that the challenges differ, locations, shooter counts etc all change. The gang street fight is really cool but I just do not understand something, the gang leader comes to you, and then runs away from you. This is really stupid. Either just don't come, or just do the fight. If you manage to kill the leader, than the gang street fight feels stupid, you just beat some people up and suddenly you won.

Gone are the choices between having cool chainlink-woven assassin hoods, now you can only choose between having a brown leather trenchcoat or a satin lined trenchcoat.\nNot a lot of fun weapons to use this time around.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 29, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-10-03", "text": "To start off, I didn't find Assassin's Creed Unity to be a bad game - not even mediocre! In fact, I actually really liked it, despite the major flaws it had. Assassin's Creed Syndicate is, in most ways, a big improvement on Assassin's Creed Unity which to me actually says a lot in a way. Story wise, here it is a MUCH lighter tone and it is very welcome - while I love dark, depressing stuff, this game was full of light and hope and ultimately it wasn't as depressing as AC Unity, in which pretty much nothing good happens. Let's see, shall we? I will be comparing AC Unity a lot to this since they both have pretty much the same gameplay.\nStealth this time around was made MUCH better since you don't require to press buttons to move between cover, but still stealth isn't particularly good. Unity had terrible stealth and the rather hard combat system made it all the more painful, especially in the blackbox assassinations. Here, it's bearable, and there are much less and much lesser-scale assassination missions and they're also weaker and much easier. Combat is MUCH easier this time around, and is INSANELY repetitive. Some people complain that it's unnaturally fast, but I found it to look badass. It's just that... it's kinda underwhelming. It's easy, never a challenge, but I remember in the beginning it once took me almost 50 HITS to kill someone. That's insane! Here you can fail stealth all you want, since there's a very small chance you will die. Now, the problem is not that it is EASY, and I don't want Ubisoft to get the wrong message (they won't ever even read this so who cares) but HARD =/= GOOD. The Batman Arkham games have amazing combat for a reason - it's epic, fast and fluid and it is very fun to beat people up. Meanwhile, AC STILL doesn't have truly good combat. I'd say AC 3 and 4 had decent combat, but still was very very easy. AC Unity was not horrible, but sometimes felt very unfair because of the poor stealth. Here, it's decent. It would be much better if the enemies took less damage before dying, since the fights do get drawn out and boring. But that's enough on the combat.\nThe blackbox assassinations were a huge part of AC Unity, and one of the biggest selling points. In that game, they were simply stunning, and there were plenty of them. Here, there's either much less, or they're MUCH more underwhelming to even realise it's an assassination mission. There's really only one truly memorable assassination mission which happens in Sequence 4. Still, they're here and make the experience more fun.\nThis game's open world, while probably the most ALIVE EVER in an AC game, still suffers from repetitive side missions. Well, the liberation missions. It's like, 3 or 4 missions copy and pasted around the whole map and you have to do them 10 times each at LEAST. I strongly recommend not doing them unless the game forces you to (at one point, it will).\nHowever, as negative as this review might sound, I actually really really really enjoyed this game. It was very fun. The open world was beautiful, it felt alive, the gameplay was solid and really felt like GTA in London. The parkour is fun as always, though London may have been a bit TOO big (lol) which is why they brought in the zipline from Batman. Driving around London is fun and there are races you can do. There honestly is never a dull moment, unless you force yourself through some of the side missions. The main story missions are well directed, and some missions are very charming. I loved both of the protagonists, and their story was wonderful. Both have great voice acting and Jacob is hot as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, no homo. There is some degree of politics (definitely) and some moments are intriguing, and some are just downright great in every way. You have to experience it to know.\nGraphics are also really good. There are times where you will be awed - even just looking at the assassin outfits! It runs about the same as Unity I guess (but less bugs, even though I only encountered like 2 or 3 in 30 hours of ACU), but doesn't look AS good. I encountered some really weird freezes that lasted around 5 seconds. It happened throughout my whole experience, around every 50 minutes or so - they weren't enough to be a HUGE problem, but definitely something I noticed. In one of the last missions, it happened very consistently but still didn't manage to completely ruin the experience.\nThe final boss fight, while I don't want to spoil too much, was in some way better than Unity, but still was very boring and very easy. At least the ending was good (not sure what IGN was complaining about).\nFinally, I would like to talk about the extra missions included which features historical characters like Karl Marx, Charles Dickens, even Winston Churchill in a surprise World War 1 section (which is entirely optional and good but it's the same mission copy and pasted 5 times), hell even Queen Victoria! All of these are fun and meeting up with these historical figures is quite interesting even if the missions may end up being quite boring or lackluster at SOME points. Still worth playing.\nWhat else is there to say? Voice acting is pretty top notch, it is an all around good game, even though it is quite easy and somewhat underwhelming. If you have any questions (you probably didn't even get this far in the review, but if you did, hurray!) don't hesitate to add me or write in the review comments.

I went in with very low expectations.

This game came out 2 YEARS from when I started playing it and there are still massive bugs - Freezing during parts of storylines, ragdolling at random points, and just overall roughness in animation.\nThe gameplay is weak. This has fealt the most \"on-rails\" of any Assassin's Creed game. I think the developers saw all the times people would accidently jump at an angle they didn't want to in previous games that they just made it impossible for anyone to do anything. It seems like one step further would be to add a query for each movement, \"Would you like to Jump right? Yes No\" How many Assassin's Creed games are there? And they STILL haven't ironed out the most basic part of the game? Don't get me started on the combat. You have three buttons that you mash. Oh is mashing left clicking not working? Try space bar once. Someone going to attack you? Deflect it and instantly kill them with E.\nThe story is so Open-World that I'm not sure what I should be focusing on. What's a main story quest, and which one is just a side quest? Am I missing an important quest to get this cool weapon, or is it some pay-2-win item?\nI could go on and on, but I think i'm just going to stop there for now.

I gave it the good old college try but got about 4 hours in before getting sick to my stomach from enduring it.\nThere are four factors that can sum up my experience with this game.\n1)\n: Absolutely horrendous and lazy. \"Too many cooks spoils the broth\" as they say, as the writing makes this game seem more like a fan-fiction, than a triple-A title. The thoughts and plot devices connecting each of the missions are incredibly, weak and paper thin. It makes it obvious most of the budget went into the facial animation for major historical figures, and fixing all of the technical errors in their new engine. The first two hours of gameplay thankfully didn't have a \"play as a child and experience the death of your parent\" section. It did however consist of ham-fisted characterisations of Jacob and Evie Frye.\nHalf of the dialogue is purely to set up Jacob's delivery of corny one-liner after one-liner like a bad 80s action movie, while his sister Evie shoots him jokingly condescending looks. After all, who can say no to a complaining man-child, who is always asking \"why am I not stabbing a person wearing a nazi-like Templar armband right now?\" (Because they actually do that in this one). The Crime Syndicate aspect in the game is clumsily rushed into the fore-ground by Jacob, with his bloodthirsty child-like glee, apparently because he's \"always wanted to run a gang\". Meanwhile Evie wants to do Assassin things and track down a piece of Eden (as always).\nWhile the marketing team tries to paint the two as completely different play-styles, there really is no difference in gameplay between the two until you get to the final levels of progression, where they each are able to acquire 3 buffs that the other can't. Evie's being Stealth Boost, ACTUAL INVISIBILITY, and Throwing Knife Buffs, Jacob's being HP, Firearm, and Damage Buffs. The other 49 skills they can both acquire.\n2)\n: Assassinations have gotten boring, playing the same few animations of stabbing in the small of your target's back when you're in sneak mode. When the animation DOES differ (when your character is NOT sneaking), it often ignores the context of the environment and plays a random animation. The combat pacing (and choreography) is terrible. There is also now a combo meter, and combat is based around four different mechanics. Attacking, Guard-Breaking, Countering, and Dodging. For each press of the [Attack] button, your Assassin will strike at least twice. In a one on one battle you can mash the button and a normal enemy is helpless. If they're a \"brute\" enemy, (that is to say the bald-headed strong-man who is the ONLY character model for this archetype in the game) they might try to attack through your combo, which you can counter and ignore. The Syndicate fighting isn't even as well thought-out as the Arkham fighting system, as it doesn't reward you for timing your attacks. So feel free to button mash, and if you split attacks between more than one enemy they get REALLY confused. You never really feel threatened or in danger. If an enemy tries to shoot you from afar, there's no need to worry. You have several seconds to prepare and execute a Nicholas Cage-like bullet dodge with the dodge button. So you can dodge every bullet. Welcome to the Animatrix.\nWhen you reduce an enemy's health to 0, they don't fall or die. They stay in a Punch-Out-esque slouched position, half heartedly attacking you until you perform a horrendously animated \"finishing move\" on them with the camera zooming in for dramatic effect. Mind you, it's not very dramatic when this happens with literally every single enemy in the game. The sound design is very lacking here as well, as many finishers use borderline stock sound effects for your fists and weapons impacting. Many of these are poorly synced to the animations as well.\n3)\n:  Everyone complains about the grappling hook/zip line. It is actually a very smart choice in design, and highlights a flaw in the setting. The broad streets of London, and tall flat faced buildings, do not allow AC's free-running/climbing mechanics to shine. One of the quintessential Assassin's Creed features does not translate well to a modernizing city. Who would've thought. I am glad the grapple mechanic was introduced, as it helps gloss over the fact that:\na) The setting was a poor choice for the style of game they were making, which is why they're going back to Ancient Egypt, avoiding Ultra-Wide city streets.\nand\nb) They absolutely botched the free-run nav-meshing and made it feel unsatisfying and clumsy to run across rooftops and parkour through the city.\nThe camera is also unbearably close to your character with a very minimal FOV. Very bad for those of you who experience simulation sickness easily, expecially seeing as it jumps around desperately trying not to clip through walls. There is no known way to change this. Not through in-game settings, or ini edits, so have fun on your collect-athon kids.\nThe clothing physics were also locked at 30 fps for my game, and so i was left wearing a card-board cape for the first hour of my experience. (I use a 60 hz monitor on a medium range rig). There is a fix for this at least, and it's relatively easy to find if you google it yourself.\n4)\n: Seems everyone in Industrial London is both deaf and legally blind. Citizen NPCs have absolutely NO impact on the environment. Everyone is there solely to react to you. None of their reactions trigger anything. They just stand there in wonder, or scream and beg you not to kill them. Meanwhile the guard standing 15 feet behind them has no idea of what's transpired because he's facing the opposite direction and apparently needs some hearing aids. Enemies have a visual range of maybe 20 feet or 6 meters, and no peripheral vision whatsoever. There is one such example early on in the game which i'd like to point out.\n[There is a civilian talking with a guard who is also his friend. I killed the guard in front of him because he wouldn't move on, and I needed to pass him without being detected. The civilian man stood \tthere screaming, hands at his side in a nuetral position. Meanwhile the guard behind him was completely unaware of what happened because he was facing 90 degrees to the left. The civilian didn't sound any alarms.]\nThe AI is bare-bones and is there for decoration.\nThis is the easiest stealth game I've ever played.\nIt is the worst Assassin's Creed I've ever played.\nIt is the least interesting Assassin's Creed I've ever played.\nDo not spend more than $10.00 on this game. It's not worth it I assure you.", "hours": 4.3, "username": "Rom", "products": 107, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

And plenty or other bugs like weird and suddend deaths after you finish an enemy or you slightly bump a carriage, missions not loading properly like when i had to kill a weird dressed guy scaring the people pretending he is some sort of demon, i went in to the cellar and killed his friends but he refused to show up for the party.

The ability to climb ANY building? And I could be this cool ninja-like hooded killer that could coordinate just HOW he wanted to assassinate a target? Wow!\nI played Assassin's Creed 2 in 2009. That game wowed me. They improved every mechanic from the first Assassin's Creed. I loved where it was going. The story was AMAZING! I felt a sense of progression as if I was growing up with Ezio Auditore (the assasssin in that game). We were with him from the moment of his birth to the moment of his death.\nI played Assassin's Creed 4 in 2013. That game wowed me. They removed the ability to kill a target any way you wanted but in its stead, they allowed you to explore the open seas of the Caribbean. In addition, the story was amazing. Just like Ezio's story, the story in Assassin's Creed IV had progression to it. The person you were and the state of the world in the beginning of the game changes durastically by the end. It also tied some loose ends from AC3 that lingered.\nNow, I come to this game. I am not wowed. In fact, I am disgusted by this game. For one, Ubisoft charges you REAL WORLD CURRENCY to buy virtual money. Yeah, you remember the money you had to earn in AC2, 3, 4? You can now just pay a low fee of $30 for 100,000 in game money. The money doesn't even get you anything special. You buy things just like you could in AC2 (medicine, bullets, etc).\nThe story in this game is absolute trash as well. The Jacob Frye voice actor sounds like a random guy they picked off the streets. \"Hey buddy, if we bought you a pint, would you like to do the voiceover in our game?\" The guy overexaggerates EVERYTHING he says. On top of that, the story seems to be going nowhere. The plot established from the first game is long gone. There is no sense of mystery. However, that is not because questions were answered. If anything, questions were UNANSWERED from the ending of Assassin's Creed 3. It doesn't seem to progress anything. It's just another Assassin's vs Templar's story with no ultimate end in sight.\nThat doesn't mean everything in this game sucks. In fact, the environment is AMAZING. The size of London as well as the beautiful graphics really captivates my eye. Unfortunately, the animation for both running and combat is trash. It looks like a game for babies where you're controlling Mr. Wiggles (I don't know what character that is, it just sounds like a character that wiggles his arms everywhere until he hits someone). The running animations look like they were ripped from 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas multiplayer mode.\nI really wanted to like this game. I wanted to find a semblance to AC1 or AC2 but they've lost the plot. Ubisoft has lost the plot, guys. They plan on releasing a new AC game in 2018 so let's hope to heck they get on with the plot.\nI give this game a 6/10 - it's a great game on its own but it doesn't live up to the hype of the Assassin's Creed series. They should have made this a spin-off series called 'Creed of Assassins' or something. At least then I'd understand it's a story taking place in the Assassin's Creed universe and not an actual continuation of the story.", "hours": 5.1, "username": "King Aria", "products": 362, "found_funny": 12, "early_access": false}

Do not purchase any Ubisoft product from Steam to expect a reasonable experience.\nI am still unable to play the game as I have been locked out of my U-Play account.\nEdit 2017-10-06:\nTL;DR Ubisoft account management needs work. Subjectively 3rd Best AC beneath AC Brotherhood and AC2, perhaps tied with the first game of the franchise. If you like AC and its formula, you most certainly won't be disappointed with AC Syndicate. Also, races suck. The AI cheat and you need to get lucky to win.\nUbisoft support managed to unlock my Uplay/Ubisoft Account due to an issue pertaining to two-factor authorisation. Search on their forums for more information. I have since completed most of the game.\nTechnically, this title actually managed to not be a buggy piece of unoptimised garbage like AC Unity was. Just don't expect to run it on a potato like Source games. They have managed to tame the engine, assets and AI to run at reasonable frame rates for machines that are at or above minimum system requirements.\nSyndicate's setting of solely London serves this title well, with the focus still providing a healthy variety of architecture and landscape to freerun about and experience. Most of each section of London have their own character and feel largely realistic along with its missions and characters, which contrasts with the blandness of Unity's Paris. The Thames and train network made the world feel alive, though I find that they could certainly do more with all of the rail tracks that they put in the game.\nThe map still contains lots of collectibles and things for you to do, but it's not a clutterfest like some of the other titles and lags out your game tremendously. It serves its purpose and icon representation are mostly clear.\nI am glad that you don't have to be forced to pilot a vehicle (like sailing in AC IV and Rogue) just to travel to new locations, since I got quite sick of just how much I had to sail in IV and Rogue. The grappling hook is a great addition to the siblings' arsenal in and as an alternative means of travel if you decided that carriage driving sucks. My issues with it though is that the grappling hook feels a little overpowered at times for getting away from a conflict.\nThe freerunning system feels just like Unity, but much less buggy. There are still instances where your character doesn't do what you intend it to, but the \"rules\" of climbing and dropping are much more defined, and you will know when and what kind of architecture or obstable would bug out the freerunning, so you know to avoid getting your character into those specific spots. A frequent issue would be your character grappling hook up to the roof instead of freerunning through the window, since the control bind of those two features are shared.\nThe \"cover\" system is fluid and is done by being in stealth mode and moving to edge of walls and objects. It's smart enough to know exactly what you want most of the time, but often the stealth movement itself doesn't allow you to position your character at the exact spot. It isn't tremendously frustrating though, as you often remain fully covered by the object from the AI actor that you are hiding from.\nCombat is leaps ahead of Unity. It felt like they referenced quite a bit from the Arkham series. Animation cues are much clearer and but the mechanics might have been a bit too simple. The combo system feels arbitrary and you don't get to \"spend\" your large combos to achieve satisfying results. Occasionally there are still small quirks and bugs that causes desynchronisation, which is a great source of frustration as the combat system leave you defenseless even though your control input remain consistent with all your previous successful combat instances.\nIn Syndicate, play as either Evie or Jacob Frye, a pair of twins that were almost one-dimensional characters. But because there are two of them, it remains somewhat interesting with their dynamics and how the story is driven. There are some development near the end of the main story which makes them just a little bit more interesting than their English accents and mannerisms. (Who doesn't love British accents?)\nEach time you gain a set amount of experience points awarded by performing gameplay mechanics or completing missions, you get skill points that are awarded regardless of whether you play on Evie or Jacob. i.e. If you gain ten skill points to invest in Jacob's skills, you have ten to invest in Evie's own tree as well.\nThey each have a very mildly differing skill tree; a small number of exclusive high level skills for each character. With that in mind, it seems that it was designed to encourage players to skill Evie and Jacob differently, in theory allowing you to invest in very different skills for each character and choosing the correct character for the correct occasions. In practice, they differ too little and you would end up investing in the same ones that work due to the missions you prefer to do first. Later on in the game when you attain enough experience that allow you to learn every skill, the Fryes really don't play that differently. That's not to say that the skill investment system is poor or is a bad idea, it just isn't important and doesn't add that much to the Assassinating experience.\n100% sync mission requirements are much less frustrating now, but feels too easy at times. I would much rather easy than frustrating, since Ubisoft does not understand the concept of difficulty or challenge, and uses frustration as a replacement.\nWintory did a tremendous job for the soundtrack. Personally, I feel that this is the best AC soundtrack since Ezio's time. It could use a little more variety but I loved it.\nSound design is above average for an AC title. The issue of making certain dialogue lines too loud to draw attention to itself (I never bought the Animus or whatever argument) is much less prevalent and my ears enjoyed the game.", "hours": 75.8, "username": "fix in post guy / AK", "products": 65, "early_access": false}

A character selection based on different playstyles was created praising the player for their style of play and not punishing them, Overall a great game.

Character wise, I really liked them a lot. I thought it brought something a little different than your usual broody or suave assassin stereotype.

It was fun, rather complex and ultimately delivered what I was expecting. Was it the best AC to date? Nah, but let me get into details.\nGameplay: Until we get the next AC, this is the best we've got. It feels as fluid as ever.\nCombat is great for those not looking for a real challenge but at the same time wanna have fun with it. What I mean by this is that if you're coming from Dark Souls, you're not gonna like it. It's simple, rewarding and the executions are great.\nClimbing was greatly improved/made easier with the new grapple hook. You may not like it if you're a diehard fan of the franchise but you'll also use it all the time. It's extremely useful and advantageous even though it takes away some of the fun that was figuring out how to climb something. A not so needed but still welcome addition.\nGraphics: I must say that coming from Unity, this game was not as pretty. I don't know what they've changed but it just doesn't feel that good. However, London is still London and if you're an admirer of that city you're definitely gonna like it. It delivers, every major landmark is there and the atmosphere of industrial London was nailed by the producers. Nothing much to say about it, I loved playing this game in my favourite city.\nPerformance: I ran this game with an i5 7400 and a GTX 1060 6GB. Performance is AWFUL. If you have similar or lower specs than mine, be ready to either play at potatoe quality in order to attempt to reach 60fps or just do like me and give up on that smooth gameplay and just max out everything and settle for peasant-like 30 FPS. I play AC for the story and the graphics, so I had no other choice. Crashes? Yeah, maybe twice. Nothing too bad. Game breaking bugs? None, surprisingly. Coming from previous AC, this was a soothing surprise.\nStory: Aah, finally, what you've been waiting for.\nThe story starts a bit slow, I had a hard time getting into it. As the game progresses, it gets a bit better but then reaches a plateau. An acceptable and respectable plateau, mind you, but I was left with a sort of bitter taste since I was expecting a bit more from it. I liked Unity, I think it's an underrated game... but this one, I don't know. I feel like it was rushed, at least the ending, and that they wanted to make it longer than previous AC and just included a bunch of unnecessary and tedious missions. However, the Assassination missions... oh boy I liked those. If you read my Unity's review you'd know that I liked them. Here, they are the same but maybe improved. I think there was only one tail mission in the entire game (yay) and no eavesdropping or anything like it. Almost none \"you were spotted, mission failed\" as well, another welcome change.\nSo, did I like the story? Yeah, I liked it. Would I go running into the street telling people to play this game? Definitely not. Was it a bad AC? Uhmmm I wouldn't say so... it just falls short of ground breaking content. Oh, and the present day story is almost non existant and weird, if you were wondering that.\nConclusion: If you've played previous AC and have a decent computer to run this game, go ahead and buy it. You won't be disappointed. If you're new to the saga, I'd recommend buying the Ezio saga, those were the good old days.", "hours": 24.9, "username": "Scaviferro", "products": 81, "early_access": false}

The game is beautiful, despite not having an actual weather or day/night system. I love having 2 characters, and i love the outfits for them both. The combat is quite repetitive, but I think the new animations are quite cool. I guess that's just me, as I like these flashy and fast fighting styles over the traditional slow paced style.\nHowever, I am annoyed at Ubisoft for removing the \"free jump\" feature, which was present in essentially every single previous title. Being forced to jump down from buildings/obtacles, or just jumping off a ledge/bridge is a serious pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Completely negates fluidity, which I believe to be the sole purpose of introducing the jump up/down feature. Ubisoft has to know that this feature is quite good, but it is supposed to complement free jumping, not replacing it. Thus, I think this game is a step down from AC Unity's parkour system.\nStory and character wise, everything is quite predictable. The story is a tad bland at times, and we weren't given an in-depth story of the characters so it's hard to be attached to them. However, I do enjoy the fact that they're assassins right from the start, unlike other games where you're forced to play their pre-assassins life.\nThere isn't much else to say really, but I do recommend this game, especially if you're a true AC fan.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 42, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-07-18", "text": "Initially I was a bit skeptical to buying and playing this game due to the criticism the series have gotten all over the Internet the last years. I played the Assassins Creed 3 almost five years ago and I loved it, but my computer back then were barely able to handle it so I never continued the series and then it fell out of memory.\nThen I saw the trailer for this, and the buildup seemed so nice and the fact that there would be a playable female protagonist in a major installment seemed really interesting. I got it on the summer sale for half price due to my skepticism.\nNow I have played through the main game, and I cannot but say that I am in awe. This is in no way a bad or rushed game, which some people claim as a kind of leftover from earlier mistakes in the series. But then again, when I play games like these and just stop for a moment to observe the animated world, all the details, all the small details in npc, their AI, all the meshes, textures, music and whatnot.. it blows my mind that there are not more bugs than it is.\nIn terms of programming and artistic work, writing and character development, these things are really masterful creations. Just as any other game of the same size.\nI have no doubt in my mind that a lot of gamers take a little too much for granted and neglect all the effort it takes in order to create games like these.\nAnyhow..\nI really enjoyed the story and the characters, especially Evie, her character had that mysterious depth to it which is to be expected from an assassin. Jacob was more of the blunt tool, but I really liked his naive gentleness, like for example how he treated the horses when driving a carriage. Despite being twins, he gave the sensation of being the younger of the two mentally.\nThe analogy of their storylines and how they intertwine gives life to the story, and I read somewhere that the story seemed shallow and rushed. I wonder if gamers these days are refereeing to their own intellect when making those remarks, as the amount of details, fluff and buildup in the storys were more than enough to satisfy even me. And I am not even a nerd who is that well read into the lore of the series.\nI also loved the detail that their personalities were mirrored in the soundtrack, once I became aware of this detail, it became rather obvious, and made the music seem like a inside joke, or inside story. The Soundtrack were in and of itself awesome, and seemed to read my mind on when to launch certain songs, as their timing were amazing.\nSure, there are some details that made me really annoyed throughout my gameplay, and I mean annoyed. Like for example, if you knocked out a guard, hid him behind the boxes you covered, whistled for another guard and when he approached, instead of knocking him out the character insisted on starting carrying the body of the already knocked out guard, ruining the cover, mission and my experience. For future games they should consider leaving the option for separate keys for separate actions, as layering functions on the same key may have devastating effects on the gameplay.\nAnd not only the undercover cop seemed to have a subtle longing for a sexchange, because I met several npc's with the wrong voice for their apparent gender. Although this was far more amusing than annoying. The funniest moment would be when a young man was robbed and started screaming with the voice of an old lady to stop the youngster who have robbed him. I helped him only to hear him thank me as an old lady. Priceless.\nAs for the lore, as I have done som casual studying, it is nothing short of amazing. I love the metaphors and subtle hints, the obvious and esoteric references, occult parallels and all the other jazz down that road.\nI guess that any initiated or well read and (truly) open minded intellectual with a fancy for gaming would enjoy this game.\nEven I did, and I am not a good gamer, quite the opposite (which made me almost furious over my lack of skills at some points in the game) but I enjoyed the intellectual content of the game so much that I was not able to make me quit, instead I got a good exercise in the practice of profanity.\nI am glad that I doubted the criticism and gave this game a chance, because it was absolutely worth it.\nAnd I look forward to the coming installment, as Egyptian mythology and their esoteric teachings are one of my favorite fields which I have passed in my studies of the occult. I am curious to see how it is rendered through a gaming experience which this series offers so brilliantly.\nYes, I do absolutely recommend this game.", "hours": 50.8, "username": "Theta", "products": 234, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I haven't made it very far into the game's story, because I'm the type who tries to do all of the available map-opening side quests first so I won't comment on it. Mechanically I do not recommend this game.\nDuring a kidnapping event, grabbing Jamie Something-or-Other who appeared to have nothing more to his list of crimes than a frequent urge to peep into people's windows and bang on their door if he didn't like their utensil placement or something. The problem here is that he was scripted to walk up the five steps to their doorway and just sit there in his animations for twenty seconds at a time before moving a foot to the side and doing it again. To kidnap someone you need to approach them stealthily, from behind. Now I was crouched with my hood up sniffing this man's bottom, a greeting I believe is still customary in Modern London, and I wasn't prompted to kidnap him nor could I despite him following his scripted placement and me following the instructions to the letter.\nThen we get to the problems with knives and weapons, and I understand the mechanic where your lack of spit-shining your knives so that they menacingly glimmer in the sunlight as they spiral towards your victims head for more damage than the layman's unpolished murder utensil, but I honestly feel that it has no purpose in a game that tries to be more \"realistic\" in its combat weight. These men are wearing a bowler hat at most on their head, and you're telling me that the sweat of their brow is so significantly dense that it utterly deflects my knife as they scoff at me? Not to mention that if you do manage to stealthily kill a man with a knife, or by dropping barrels on him by severing their rope with a knife, all of their friends see the corpse and instantly predict the wind, trajectory, and velocity of your knife to know where you're standing five seconds later five stories up on a brick shanty. I've failed stealth missions entirely based on that, killing a man from a rooftop with a thrown knife, walking down the cobbled street for a spot of tea, and then his friends all showing up on my radar simultaneously shaking their fists and telling me I have no business here from twelve blocks over.\nFor a series about stealth, the amount of times I've been detected by not being witnessed doing a stealth kill is astonishing. Not to mention the times I've been told to kill a leader undetected, lure their guard away with a whistle and kill them, then watch as another man spawns right before my eyes from a bowler hat brought in with the breeze and blows my cover as his first action in this mortal coil.\nWithout any opinion on the story, I can't recommend this game based on how utterly unwieldy it is to play. It doesn't feel good to control, the stealth is a dice roll at best, and parts of the game force you to upgrade items that shouldn't need upgrading because of their core purpose.\nWith all of that said though, I've passed the steam deadline on refunds so I'll probably slog through the game for completion's sake alone.\nEdit : I've tried to play more of it and my opinion on it only gets worse. I'm not going to put any more time into this miserable game. I'm being instantly killed at full health by a random grunt two levels below me after I've maxed out the health upgrades possible this early on, you don't get any items back when you die which means if you've been killed by the Second Coming like I keep experiencing your odds of surviving get infinitely worse and I'm not even on a mission I'm just trapped in this temporal flux of hatred.", "hours": 31.2, "username": "Friendzone", "products": 602, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 45, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-07-13", "text": "Fun game with more personality than AC: Unity, it largely streamlines the better aspects of the franchise's gameplay and doesn't feel as bloated as some prior games.  The ability to switch between main characters is a welcome addition, though the character's motivations in cutscenes still feel schizophrenic when contrasted with actual gameplay.\nThe setting of Victorian England is excellent (so was the French Revolution but Unity managed to make that bland somehow!), the gang warfare aspects are fun even if largely a repeated template and the side-character memories spice things up a little.  The game also doesn't mind having a little fun at its own expense, like characters rolling their eyes at the big self-important speeches targets make post-assassination.  Unfortunately the main villain isn't particularly memorable (there is a VERY memorable side-villain who shows up very late in the game and is unfortunately quickly killed off) nor does he feel particularly effective or dangerous regardless of what the game insists on telling you.\nThe modern day framing is reduced as much as possible without removing it entirely (please just remove it entirely) and remains as uncompelling and uninteresting as before.  The \"witticisms\" of the tech character seems to have been toned down somewhat, though it remains a mildly frustrating presence while trying to read up on the history of characters/locations in the database you assemble throughout the game.  Being a ubisoft game, the collectibles are overkill and maps don't exist for a couple of items, making it an exercise in frustration to find yourself 1-2 items short of clearing a section of the map.  The game frequently presents you with \"helix points\" for doing things.  I have no idea what helix points are and since it didn't seem to affect the game in any noticable way I didn't bother looking it up.\nBasically this is a fun Assassin's Creed game.  It doesn't do anything particularly revolutionary or change up the franchise much (Black Flag remains the high watermark in that regard) but it does what it does very well.  There's a lot of the same problems from previous games, but they've been reduced to some degree while what is fun has been polished quite nicely.

The controls were so light compared to Unity's. Unity's controls did feel sluggish, but this game felt like the developers took the backlash and went to the other end of the extreme. These controls felt very cheap compared to Unity's. I immediately thought this was some knock-off; this didn't feel at all like an Assassin's Creed game.  But, like with Unity, once I got used to it, I liked it a bit more. Nevertheless, this feeling of cheapness still reverberated in other areas of the game.\nIt's odd how many things were improved--stealth (and whistle), free-running, modern day (just by a smidge, cutscenes were longer and had more of an arc to them)--and yet it still had a number of problems. Overall, Unity and Syndicate stand almost level for me when I weigh the pros and cons, but I prefer Unity. It has a better story, albeit not a great one. It has wonderful graphics and intense detail. It focused on stealth, the main feature of all the games, even if it was kind of bad sometimes. The combat isn't great either, but once you get the hang of it, it gets a bit easier and a little more fun (when its not buggy).\nAnyway, more about Syndicate: I liked that it has twins for its main characters, Evie and Jacob, and that they bounced off each other well. The Rooks gang is a fun addition. The carriage riding is alright but not very necessary. My least favorite part of these games is travelling over halfway across the map to get to the next mission. The grappling hook helps climb buildings faster, but it's still as inconsistent as the parkour system, so it replaces one buggy thing with another.\nThe story is lighter and less serious at times, which is nice because these games act too self-serious to be as spotty, repetitive, and inattentive to its story as they are. If the goal is merely to play an assassin in the past, then just drop the sci-fi (which I would prefer not to do, actually; I want there to be a purpose, just not one so lazy) and have some fun with it. Treading water over multiple games in this middle ground leaves neither side satisfied.\nThe combat, like the movement, flipped 180 from Unity's. It's very fast. Maybe it's fitting for a brutal englishman/englishwoman to be pummeling their enemies with furious fists, but it seems that Ubisoft Quebec's idea of difficulty is requiring a lot more punches to kill (kind of like a bullet sponge). Also, there's fewer finishers, so that on top of more punching makes for repetitive combat. They add a bullet dodge button here, which I appreciate after many AC games where I could not escape bullets. It's more responsive fighting than I've seen from Unity, but it's less interesting.\nOne thing that continued from Unity is the skill tree, which I hate in both. It feels like grinding work to get the assassin fun I've been having in previous games, the ones that didn't require me to pass any superficial roadblocks. This seemed like another cheap way to pad on some more difficulty.\nOverall, Syndicate improves on some things and regresses on some others, just like Unity.

It baffles me how this even made it into the game. Ubisoft got the it right for post boxes, giving them the 'VR' insignia, Queen Victoria's. Anyways, point stands that it was a very lazy mistake, that could have easily been avoided.\n-The game just crams in every historical figure that was around at the time and suggests almost no conflict of interests.\n'Oh Yes, Karl Marx, I shall escort you to your trade union, not until after I finish an odd job for Queen victoria though.'\nThis seriously damages the dramatic value of the game. If the protagonist is just a 'yes-man' for every mission-giver then the game seriously just becomes Historical Figure Hunter 5. Even Assassin's Creed 3 had Connor standing up to allies like Washington, Samuel Adams, etc, and it made for an interesting story by casting scrutiny on colossal figures in history.\n-Syndicate has reverted back to the old style of Templar, the textbook Moustache-Twiddling villain who is unmistakably evil. This made for a really watered down plot. Ending was terrible.\n-Rope Launcher ruining what was half of the fun in the first few games of the series.\nOkay, I feel bad so I will highlight some of the PROS:\n-Combat is  more challenging challenging, thought lack of weapon choice (being limited to 3 types of melee weapon) does make it dull.

But after Ubisoft got more and more comfortable with taking the p.i.s.s and eventually ran their own hype-train into a ravine with the disastrous releases of Watch Dogs and Assassin\u2019s Creed: Unity, I was done - since 2007 I\u2019d played 7 Assassin\u2019s Creed games, putting, at a conservative estimate, more than 250 hours of my life into the series; Assassin\u2019s Creed: Syndicate was (hopefully) the last of the annual AC games, and despite being a better game, generally speaking, compared to Unity, but frankly, at this point I just couldn\u2019t be f@#ked. But now it\u2019s 2 years later, and after a solid break from the exhausting open-world formula that had homogenised so many of Ubisoft\u2019s major releases, I bought Assassin\u2019s Creed: Syndicate to see just how much of a return-to-form it really was, and whether it had managed to break free of the worst of the series\u2019 tropes.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Syndicate puts you in the Victorian-English boots of Jacob and Evie Frye \u2013 twin siblings, and children of a former Assassin. They venture to London in order to continue their father\u2019s legacy through divergent means \u2013 Jacob wants to cleanse London of Templar control by liquidating its high-ranking members, and Evie believes that it\u2019s more important they find the Pieces of Eden that the Templars are using to further their power.\n19th century London is gorgeously realised \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen an AC game with so much detail that is also so well-optimised. I live in London, and it\u2019s incredible to walk around the streets and see them as they might have existed 150 years ago, and see the detail that\u2019s gone into familiar sights like Westminster, Waterloo Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. I even found the place where I work - it's a theatre in the converted undercroft of a church - and lo-and-behold, a church lies atop the site in-game.\nSyndicate unfortunately perpetuates the directionless back-seating of the story following the wrap up of the 'Desmond' storyline in Revelations; Jacob and Evie are enigmatic personalities, but their story doesn\u2019t offer much by the way of motivation to progress. Perhaps I was spoiled seeing Ezio\u2019s transformation over three games from a rakish punk to a wise Master Assassin, but it seems that most of what the Frye\u2019s have going for them is their charm. Their attributes differ slightly as well \u2013 Jake is a slightly better fighter, and Evie a slightly stealthier assassin \u2013 although their similar enough to be capable no matter the person you choose to play as.\nYou can switch between characters smoothly and at will (most of the time), and while the overall experience doesn\u2019t change much, it does help to freshen things up a bit to run through a few missions as a different character and experience the game with a different flavour of personality.\nAdditions to the series include a grappling hook that allows quick scaling of buildings and easy travel between rooftops, an extension of Unity\u2019s \u2018climb up/down\u2019 mechanic that now allows you to easily descend from heights without worrying about plummeting to your death, and the ability to drive horse-drawn carts GTA-style down London\u2019s cobbled roads.\nOther than minor changes, though,  AC:S doesn\u2019t offer much new to the series stalwarts among us, adhering strictly to Ubisoft\u2019s policy of \u2018iteration, not innovation\u2019, and it\u2019s in these small changes that we see that Syndicate is often typified by imperfection.\nFor example, the parkour system that put AC on the map used to take two buttons \u2013 you hit run and climb and you could scale anything and leap from anywhere. Now, you are required to specify whether you want to climb up or down. This should be helpful, and on its own this wouldn\u2019t be such a problem, except that there is little consistency in how it executes in the game. Most small obstacles can be scaled by simply hitting run\u2026except for the random ones that can\u2019t. You can hit \u2018climb up\u2019, only to find yourself stuck at the top when it won\u2019t let you jump down. You can hit \u2018climb down\u2019, only to find that it doesn\u2019t work on anything over 3ft high. So what used to be a fluid process now requires constant input adjustment, troubled by the fact that you can never be entirely sure if what you\u2019re pressing is going to allow the action it should. Even worse is the fact that you simply cannot jump from a building if the game deduces that you will get hurt \u2013 self-determination be damned, you\u2019re flat-out denied the ability to leave the top of a building by any means other than scaling it or leaping into a haystack. The developers have endeavoured to stop the player leaping blind to their death, and have unfortunately stopped the player leaping at all.\nThis is perhaps the most annoying side-effect of the changes, although I also found the target tracker to be very touchy - performing multiple takedowns almost entirely boils down to whether the game decides that it wants to let you do it, and while double assassinations used to be easy to execute as long as the enemies were within a few feet of one another, it now seems that you need to approach from a very specific angle regardless of how close the enemies are to one another, and even a change of a few degrees will sour your plans and alert the one enemy you failed to attack.\nThe physics system can be quite janky, and corpses flop and bend in strange and unnatural ways. I also had a number of fatal, unexplained crashes that brought me back to the desktop - an annoying occurrence given that UPlay is so slow that both shutdown and startup can take minutes at a time.\nSyndicate is not the saviour of the series, is what I\u2019m saying...but that doesn\u2019t make it a bad game. I have a tendency to rant about annoyances while glossing over major boons, and aside from the stunning presentation of the city, there is some sense of levity added to the formula in the numerous entertaining money-earning activities. These particularly come into their own after meeting and completing the first mission of the character of Ned Wynert \u2013 you can rob trains, hijack carts of enemy provisions, defend your own carts that tour the city, and rob or sabotage enemy ships that sail down the Thames.\nOn top of that, each borough of London lies in the hands of the enemy gang. Their hold can be loosened by performing a number of missions such as Templar assassinations, freeing child labourers, and kidnapping gang leaders and delivering them to the constabulary. For each of these actions completed, a section of the borough comes under your control, and is populated with your gang members. They didn\u2019t make the same mistake as Far Cry 3 and 4 and turn your territories into a ghost town upon liberation, and enemies still appear with a reduced frequency, but now you will have more help at hand should you stumble across an interloper within your territory.\nHowever, while not anywhere near as fraught as Unity, Syndicate retains the signs that the formula is simply exhausted and stagnant, and while I can enjoy the virtual tourism in any way shape or form, there\u2019s something irrepressibly tedious about having to go through the motions of another \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2019 game. Syndicate is a more enjoyable experience than ACIII, and certainly an improvement on Unity, but for those looking for the quintessential AC experience, you\u2019ll likely find it elsewhere.", "hours": 46.0, "user_id": "76561197972258172", "username": "[Snizza] EyesofWrath", "products": 537, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

The gameplay doesn't change much from other AC games, but now there's a skill tree to improve Jacob and Evie's traits aswell as the gang's strength. The weapons are also alot different, you'll get Brass Knuckles, the cane sword, the classic assassin's gauntlet, revolvers and the kukri.\nThe combat is a bit more fast paced, I found myself having Jacob as the hothead fighter brawling with duzens of Blighters with nothing but his brass knuckles which is damn fun and not some copied out animation like in previous games, but there could be a few more combo moves. Evie's whole style is stealth, you can liberate a whole stronghold without having them even noticing what's happening.\nThe gang activities could have alot more content of course, just like in Brotherhood, you have to liberate every single discrict in London from the Blighters and after doing this, you'll get gang wars and those are basically less than a minute long if you killed the leader previously, but you get to have up to 5 gang members following you at basically anytime and some of them can be very helpful if upgraded, the Rook volley fire is devastating.\nThe grapple gun makes travel and maneuverability alot easier, but the game has alot taller buildings and a bit bigger London than Paris in Unity, this doesn't mean much because after liberating districts there's not much more to do after besides having the endless search for chests, flowers and music boxes which I refuse to keep doing since Black Flag because it's just useless and boring work, and goes against everything a game should be, which is to be fun and not a task!\nThe story is what normally save AC games, I got alot more interested in the characters in Syndicate, there's plenty of them, besides Evie and Jacob and their allies and enemies, there missions that have you working directly with characters from the time, such as Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria herself.\nNot a masterpiece of a story by any means, but it portrays the situation of London well with plenty of corruption, mentions on the economic situation, and interesting characters, this combined with a bit more fast paced combat system makes for a good AC game, but since there is the ever presence of the grinding aspects of Ubisoft's games I would recommend purchasing the game on sale for about 20\u20ac which would give you a good value for your money alot more than a 60\u20ac edition that doesn't add much to the game.", "hours": 64.5, "user_id": "76561198054118964", "username": "Lord H", "products": 184, "early_access": false}

It destroys any sense of exploration in Syndicate because you'll find yourself zipping across the rooftops to get to objectives as quickly as possible when you're not even lazier using fast travel; you'll never really get to know the map like I felt I did in Unity which was great, knowing where to go without using the minimap gives you a great sense of accomplishment and you have to give props to the devs for that. I've lived in London and know the city very well and I still felt disconnected from the city/map in Syndicate even though I know my way around (of course the scale here is smaller but landmarks etc are in roughly the same place). Missions are spread out too far and getting from one place to the other requires no effort when you have fast travel and a grappling hook - or of course the carriages which give you the annoying \"follow me\" line because apparently we're 5 year olds who need our hands held through the entire game...\nThe one thing this game really has going for it is that you have two characters to play and for the most part you get to choose unless you're doing character specific story missions where you're forced to use one or the other. Which is a shame because I would've gladly played the entire game with Evie since Jacob is at the very least as insufferably macho as Ezio. At least when leveling up as Evie those points became available automatically for Jacob too - even though I only played as him when I was forced to. He's my least favourite male lead in the entire series.\nSince AC3 I've only truly enjoyed Unity and the Chronicles series. I know Black Flag is everyone's favourite after AC2 but for me the over reliance on island hopping and ships was a real drag. Too much pirating, not enough Assassin-ing. Thank god Assassin's Creed: Origins will be out soon and hopefully a grand return to the roots of the series.

This vintage London picture is just gorgeous, climbing on top of Big Ben or any boat on the Thames offers a unique view of London and honestly it's just close to perfection.\nThe gameplay is hugely addictive, especially for the collectors out there like me, willing to find every little secret and they are plenty. It's easy to play on keyboard (actually i'm now shifting to my Steam controller and i'm struggling, i do prefer the keyboard) . The mix between stealth and pure action, the strategy you will have to use to build your own scenario is really fun and makes the game last long. Yes you can rush if you want but you will miss a lot of of the fun and discovery in this game.\nTHe Jack the Ripper DLC is a complete new story, the settings is just perfect, cold dark and scary, really immersive, the lelvel of the game is a step ahead than  the main, the NPC now walk on roofs, detect you faster, kill you more and generally offer more challenge. The storyline is absolutely sick and again very addictive.\nThe other 2 are ok, the WW1 is a lot of fun to play, the MArajah story is rather boring and makes no sense really.\nWhat's missing / what could be improved  :\n- I think Assassin's where also using disguise, i would have really loved to see a mix of Hitman 'subdue' and disguise to go stealth in some missions.\n- AI around some NPC should really be improved : if you actually just walk in front of someone, he sees you, simple.\n- Weapon and gear customizattion :okay i guess but really could be better, basicaly a few items are just overpowered  for Evie or Jacob and making all the other uninteresting / needless to hunt.\n- Driving the carriage around is fun at first but slowly becomes a pain, there is lot of glitches around the driving etc\n- Difference between Evie and JAcob honsetly is fading level after level as both of them become very strong. Evie still owns the stealth part and JAcob hits harder but the specific skills of each of them dont make a difference in the end game.\n- The gang updates. In my opinion, this could be almost classified as a 'game hack' designed by Ubisoft... BAsically if you upgrade your gang (and money allows you to do it mostly) you are now able to storm through some mission in no time, too easy, you call them, they are level 9/10 and they just kill any gang in less than you need to open the one or 2 boxes around the place.\n- The Gang bosses are way too weak, again, you or your gang can take them down even if you play really badly, without any kind of skills, they basically die in second which is a shame and takes a lot of the challenge away.\nOverall, excellent game, i do prefer it by far to any other Assassin's game, including the Origin's one, boring setup in the desert, killing animals: not my thing", "hours": 105.7, "username": "Silicon Asperge", "products": 13, "early_access": false}

But rest assured, I had hit almost 100% on console prior to purchasing this on Steam.\nThis installment in the series was a HUGE step in the right direction, in terms of both story and gameplay.  I have a slight obsession with the AC series, and everything since AC3 just didn't really \"feel\" like AC.  This game, to me, began a turnaround back to the great character stories and dialogue we've come to expect and love from the AC series.  The game doesn't take any time at all slogging through a detailed character background sequence as per usual; it gets right into the meat of the game and lets you learn the character stories along the way.\nThis game is also optimized much better than Black Flag or Unity, and Victorian London with graphics at full blast in 4k is absolutely stunning.\nOne of the more common complaints I've seen is that the combat is too arcade-y and the addition of the grappling hook makes the game \"too unrealistic\".  I'd like to address these...\n1. The combat is much faster.  Beyond that, I don't really see how it's more arcade-like unless you consider all the others arcade-like as well.  Be honest with yourself, how many times have you found yourself in an AC game finishing a fight and suddenly finding Altair/Ezio/Connor/Edward/Arno standing in an overly large pile of corpses?\n2. As far as the grappling hook making the game \"unrealistic\", I would like to remind those critics that a core element of every AC game has involved jumping dozens to hundreds of feet/meters off of buildings INTO PILES OF HAY.\nI digress.

And the combat is FAR from what we knew in every other Assassins Creed game since AC2. There is no real choice in weaponry and the animations are stiff as hell. Remember the smooth motion-capture-like combat from every other AC game? Not here.\nThis is basically an Batman game with that grappling hook and cartoony combat. And If you think the grappling hook is optional like it was in a game like Dying Light, it isn't. They have you use it in main story missions.\nTo me Assassins Creed has been held up by three distinct pillars: Free Running, Combat, Story. If one doesn't hold up, the game is screwed.\nThey improved the Free running from Unity(which to me was notoriously bad), but made free running obsolete with the grapling hook gun that can pull you up Big Ben in a matter of seconds. Why? And why force us to use it?\nA good story is really all just preferential anyways. but I haven't played an AC story I don't like.\nThe combat. Well it's terrible.

The uncertainty, mysteriousness and fear in the game is not as in horror games, but just enough for the standard AC player to feel a slight chill up his spine.

DON'T HATE.\nTHIS GAME IS GOOD, NOT GREAT.\nAs a long time fan of this franchise, I can honestly say that THIS is the first step in the right direction that I've seen in a long time.  After the complete bombfest that was Unity and the Assassin's Creed Movie, this game is what we as a fan base needed.  Something different, yet fimiliar is the perfect recepie for a great revival of a franchise, and that's exactly what this is.  I do have a few negatives and I'll get to those in a few, but for now, here's what Assassin's Creed Syndicate got right.  By the way, I've played a LOT of hours on this game, so there's gonna be some spoilers...\n-Jacob and Evie Frye are an excellent, refreshing combo that people will love for years to come.  Their brother-sister chemestry is on point, with the banter and smartass remarks feeding off eachother more and more as the game goes on.  Their bond is very believable and well-written, and honestly, I couldn't get enough of it.  Jacob would often jab with one liners to start and Evie would end up outsmarting him with a quip of her own.  Very comical and it definetly worked.\n-London is beautiful, which at this point in the series isn't saying much, because EVERY world you play in in this series as of late has been remarkably and expertly crafted with character and it definetly has a life of it's own.  The lush blows in the wind, the bands play their tunes and it's really easy to just get lost in the big city and look around at everything and see how beautiful and well detailed everything is.  The designers definetly captured what it meant to be a citizen of London at this time in history, and I didn't hate any of it!\n-The story, while predictable at times, was really well done too!  \"Greeny,\" as I will forever know him, was a helpful and excellent 'mentor-ish' character, and a great companion.  People might say it's a little unorthodox that the twins crossed paths with the queen, but then again Ezio was buddy buddy with Leonardo DiVinci, so stfu.  All the Assassins run into extremely imprtant historical figures at some point in the game, deal with it.  Evie definetly had the better story of the two, in my opinion, because she was more interested in delving into the history of the Assassins, and recovering relics from the past and gaining a greater understanding for what it really meant to be an Assassin.  Jacob was more the shoot first ask questions later type.  Well, not literally, he definetly has a heart of gold, but he was definetly the more brash of the twins, which leads me to my next point...\n-The skill system was a welcomed addition in my opinion and well integrated into the game.  You could choose to make your Rooks better or your own character first!  Really it was a nice addition to \"play your own way,\" even though the additions weren't HUGE.  The thing I like the best about this though was the fact that Evie and Jacob are definetly different, so their skills reflect that!  Jacob is more the \"beat the crap out of people\" type, where Evie is more designed to be used for stealth, even if her invisibility is a tad over powered at certain times, but it's supposed to be, because it's one of the hardest things to unlock in the game.  And I loved how you could seemlessly switch between the two.  Definetly an excellent touch.\n-2 unnessicary additions that were AMAZING\nAnd now onto the negatives, and my dear Lord, there's a lot of them.  I'm gonna be honest, I love this series.  Hell, I'll go as far as saying I love this game, but it is definetly far from perfect.  And honestly, what game really is?  I just really love Assassin's Creed, and if being critical of it will someday somehow help future installments in the series, I'd say my two cents is worth it!  So here's my two cents...\n-Crawford Starrick.  What a name.  He's definetly a menacing looking villian and that mustache is on point, but did we really hate him?  Yeah he was running an undergound empire and killing people but did we actually care?  I mean Greeny did and you definetly knew the Frye twins did, but did we as the players of the game actually hate him?  Honestly I didn't care for him a ton as the main bad guy.  I think it'd be better if Bella Thorne was the main bad guy, and she killed Starrick/left him for dead at the hands of the Assassins only to take over in his palce.  It would be very hard on Jacob, since she tricked him into helping her at one point.  That was a good plot twist!  But I can't help but think of that as a missed opprotunity.\n-The overall lack of connection to other Assassin's Creed games was painful to me.  Yes, we did get to explore the home of Edward Kenway, where Haytham played as a child and even Evie was very excited by it in the game and so was I!  But there was hardly any mention of other Assassin history throughout the whole game!  I mean c'mon guys, there's literally hundreds of years worth of history and they go back even further if you want to talk about Minerva and Those Who Came Before.", "hours": 138.9, "username": "bitch tits", "products": 21, "early_access": false}

But, there is one real thing that bugs me.\nYou see, I like when a game provides difficulty through requiring the player improving his/her gameplay. Instead of leveling and providing a hard-locked difficulty (Craft/upgrade your gear to have a chance at killing these enemies in a fight), I prefer when each enemy offers a twist here and there that a player must understand and know how to exploit in order to defeat. There are a couple variations here, and good ones at that. But it really irks me that its spoiled by the need for levels.\nIn Assassins Creed III, there was the Jagers; the supposed \"Badasses\" of the game. You could not just attack them outright, you had to wait for them to offer you the opening.\nThat type of combat (which persisted up to Black Flag -- granted I never tried Unity) combined with the /much/ more fluent combat system presented here (more than one enemy tries to attack you at varying points in combat, it feels more like an actual fight over some kind of dance) would get my gums drooling.\nBUT, that's just the one thing that really bothered me about this game. I can't really pick at anything else revolving around the core of the game (aside from the usual collector's hunt, where's muh multiplayer).\nBut if/when we see another assassin's creed, can you just -not- give me a tophat.

Many times for simple enemies I like to RP where I knock them out rather than kill them. For fighting cops in AC:S this sucked as you basically have to kill your enemies when in combat. AC4 had a better combat system in my opinion because of the nonlethal combat system. It could have also used some different cities or landscapes. London got repetative after a while.

It was ground breaking for younger me and it captured a whole new style of gameplay. Fast forward to a month ago I decided to buy Assassins Creed Black Flag because pirates and sure enough, it was very much the same game I love and enjoy with whole new mechanics with naval battles, ship customization, Island hopping from city to city. The game was amazing. After finishing it I saw the reviews for Assassins Creed Syndicate and decided it must be even better because it is a few years newer and next gen. BOY WAS I WRONG. The mechanics are horrible, you try to do X and you end up doing Y. The missions are the same three formulaic goals with no imagination. And the Tranny- HOLY\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 You pretty much took a hot topic, and tried to monetize it by shoving it down the players throat with trying to make it seem as if it was historically significant. Women back then would dress as men because it was the ownly way to gain prestige. MEN DID NOT dress as women/choose to have there\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665lobbed off because that only knocked you down the social ladder. Did you know that in order to transition, the male has to periodically put a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665like object inside the fake \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to prevent the male anatomy from healing it because it treats it like a wound? Not to mention the potential for it to tear if you decide to go down on a BBC. Also the amount of puss that accumulates in the event of a tear, coupled with the fact you will never reach \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, only further explains why suicide rates among trans are nearly 50% in the first year of there surgery.\nEven after knowing all of this you still decide to try and ram this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665down the players throat. Additionally, why did you make Jacob out to be such a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 There was literally no reason for half of his reactions to be so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. And Evie? What the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it takes 20+ hits to kill people with her why would I want to play as a character who literally performs less than the other twin? Also the way money is collected and the leveling mechanics. Both are literally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. At least with Black Flag I could go on a rampage and take down an Armada of ships and at the end of an hour of pure fun I got to sell all my booty and see the fruits of my labor. Syndicate however makes every pound a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to accumulate and in the end I find myself scrounging and farming just to get the next \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 weapon.\nThe weapons. My god the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing weapons. A cane that has a sword in it? Dis Gun be Gud. NOPE! literally takes the player 10 hits with the blunt end of the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing thing before you draw the blade and kill someone. Even the assassin kills are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing lame. You can either choose to walk up for a pretty basic stab to the chest, or you can run up and perform the most \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 trip and stab attack which then results in taking more time to engage the enemies around you. WHAT THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665? I can not believe I can't refund my purchase on this game and because of that I will not be purchasing another Assassins creed title.\nIn short, if you are considering purchasing this game, DONT.

The story takes place in London, during the Industrial Revolution, with new allies like Alexander Graham Bell, etc.  Not sure if this is the first AC game wherein you can switch characters in-game but I have to say, this was a really good choice. Jacob and Evie have different expertise, Jacob being more confrontational, and Evie, of course, stealthier. The ability of leading a group of rebels, the Rooks, to aid you in fighting, transporting, and supplying is something unique that adds the opportunities that this game can offer.

But this has to be the best game in the entire series.This game is an absolute blast to play. The parkour is much better and the combat is also very good. Though the combat difficulty is moderate, it is fun and unlike unity it is not to tough. The story is also excellent. But the character development is quite strong in this game and the overall tone of the game remains comical.Many say that it is downgraded in comparison to unity, but it does not hold true.I have AC Unity in my account and after playing both the games Syndicate's graphics have a slight edge.The reason people think that Unity's graphics were better because the color tone of Unity's Paris and Syndicate's London is quite different and London looks a bit gloomy or washed out or whatever in comparison to Paris. But if you have played the Dead Kings DLC of Unity and then compared it with Syndicate, then Syndicate looks much better.\u00a0Also removing multiplayer and adding additional features in the game was a welcome change.\u00a0The lead characters Jacob and Evie are diverse and their constant differences and arguments pretty much sums up for strong character development in this one.\u00a0The game is very polished and the bugs are ironed out. The combat is well balanced, the open world is fun,the sandbox approach is way more polished and transportation is a lot improved(horse carriages, the most awesome AC2 set piece now implemented in the open world) and rope launcher is a time saver and it also doesn't restrict you to enjoy the old building climbing. Moreover the carriages are also not forced in each and every mission like most of the missions Batman Arkham Knight forces you to use the Bat-mobile and character customization is a lot improved and there is a better way to earn skill points than in Unity.And moreover the side quests are not boring.And the loading time is a bit less than Unity. The relationship between the two main protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye, both twins, made for some delighting family banter and quips. The contrast between Jacob, who wants to liberate London from the Blighters, a Street gang, and Evie, who sticks to the tenants of the Creed, and who wants to find Pieces of Eden to stop the templars, was really nice.\u00a0During story missions, however, you're usually locked into one character and will switch only when the game wants you to. I liked the customisation of your gang, the Rooks, allowing for backup on a fight. There's no more swords, and enemies now have a health bar on top of Thier heads. Only when this health bar is low enough can you kill them with a finisher, and these are delightfully brutal.The open world, it is ridiculously huge, Ubisoft wasn't joking when they said it was bigger than Unity's map by 30%. London is absolutely gorgeous.\nTrains add a whole new magical element as far as I'm concerned, I adore anything to do with trains and think they're a brilliant addition.", "hours": 179.3, "username": "$\u00fdnd!\u00a2@t\u20acKn!Ght\u2122", "products": 66, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It took me 13 hours of frustration and grinding to get at level 6 and get the story (simple as it is) rolling for a bit.\nThe Longer:\nPoint is, while the City is rendered in exquisite beauty in all its victorian splendor&squalor, it is \u00e1lso crawling with clone baddies that are ESP-gifted, and are psionically linked to every other baddy in the vicinity. Meaning, when You attack one in a neighbourhood that isn't Yours, or one of them sees You, the game immediately spawns oodles of baddies, and cops with \"super-batons\" that kill in just a couple of blows. Which -in turn- leads to the standard tactics of : killing..get up to the roof, press \"c\" to go stealth, wait a bit, rinse & repeat ad infinitum. Gang strongholds can be cleared-out in the same manner. A fair bit of that carried-over into AC: digital world...ehh.. \"Watch Dogs 2\" grind, grind, grind. Stealth-kills fix that for a bit, but then the crazy of the ai comes bubbling-up: I tried to stash all bodies from stealth-kills out of sight. Well, I shouldn't have bothered. Stealth kill a baddie. Let the body laying around, and in most cases no-one sounds the alarm despite citizens making a ruckus.. weird.\nAll in all, the \"open world\" is a frustrating affair that can only be enjoyed from samey-samey-roofs. Get to street level to take-in \"The Sights\" the programmers have so lovingly crafted, and you're in for endless, boring assaults of cookie-cutter baddies.\nWhat's \u00e1lso seriously annoying is the utterly sl\u00f3w levelling. It feels like a purposely stunted levelling-system to make players spend \u00e1ctual money on XP-Points. Sneaky, stinky CEO-Beancounter stuff.\nOn the rest of the game:\nWhen a neighbourhood is (FINALLY) Yours, only th\u00e9n do You get to admire the work the programmers & builders put into the game. But, by then, a lot of players will have put-down the conroller for good.\nIs the game \"hard\"? No, not really. It's rather more like\"artificially stunted\" to make it seem \"hard\" but the base-mechanics are all standard AC-fare -apart from the Grapple-Hook, which is a nice addition to shorten trips around The City- with a somewhat wonky stealth-system.\nOn a more positive note: The clothes of Evie and Jacob, are a Steampunk dream. The rich brocades, something inocuous, like the movement of Evie's cape (loathed by many, oddly enough), the lace, the buttons even, it all defines \"attention to detail\" from people that love to design stuf.\nShame that it has to live in such a mediocre, grindy game. I cannot really recommend it, unless it's in a weekend-sale for $10.- or something.\nEdit: You know when it f\u00ednally starts to get fun? With a trainer. While only using \"infinite health\", the game became far more enjoyable (for me, at least)", "hours": 97.8, "user_id": "76561198055690813", "username": "stefbuik", "products": 53, "early_access": false}

The voice acting is exceptional.  The story is better than average.  The city of London looks and feels incrediblibly alive, and has a steampunk vibe.

If you've never played an AC title, don't start with this one.\nNow for what I think... Syndicate is a beautiful game but unfortunately lacks depth and challenge, and faces a lot of the same issues that past AC titles struggled with. The city of London is masterfully brought to life, and most of my enjoyment in this game simply comes from walking (or more commonly, ziplining) around. Unfortunately it seems to be populated with a bunch of morons. Seriously, the AI in this game is somehow worse than previous AC games, it is just all around laughably bad. Combat with these morons is very easy. Button mash, counter, watch a double kill animation, dodge a bullet, repeat. Sadly this makes the whole \"sneaky assassin\" thing seem irrelevant. There is some fun to be had pretending to be sneaky, but usually it's just a chore and a self-implied challenge for minor reward. After all, if every enemy in the train station is dead, who is gonna bug me when I kidnap the conductor? At this point I'd also like to express my deep hatred for the kidnapping mechanic in this game. Not once was it fun, very few times did it make contextual sense, and often it was bug-riddled and terrible. Also the crowd-blending thing, which has been very useful in most AC titles, now seems to be butchered and hardly works at all. The enemies you are tasked with killing are usually very forgettable. And the common thugs all look very similar, it's like killing the same ugly englishman/woman over and over again all around London.\nSo now it sounds like I hate this game... but I actually mostly enjoy it. It's a guilty pleasure really, running around completely overpowered, killing everything in sight so that I can collect beers or flowers or whatever the hell you collect in this game. Ziplining is almost as good as the Batman Arkham titles, but it occasionaly fails at moments when you really need it to work. The protagonists are likeable enough and many of the historically-inspired allies have fun little side stories that make the whole game seem like a parody, which is good because at this point I find it very hard to take the AC storyline seriously. (minor spoiler:\n) Riding carriages is fun, taking over London is fun (though repetitive), and, if you're into it, collecting all the things is fun. Also the game is very well optimized for PC, as far as I can tell. Just make sure to put it on an SSD or you will face load times from hell.", "hours": 49.8, "username": "Blingtron", "products": 432, "early_access": false}

The inclusion of horse drawn carriages lead to some of the most fun and chaotic moments in the game.

I had expected that the folks at Ubisoft to actually learn from their mistakes (Unity) and strive to make a better AC experience in through Syndicate. After giving this game so many chances to prove itself, ultimately it is still a major letdown by Ubisoft.\n1) Controls are still very wonky and stiff\n= Parkour are super-smooth and semi-realistic (if you would excuse all the extreme parkour of course), but the controls for the game was not improved. It is still wonky and stiff in execution, which leads to frustrating movements and maneuvers.\n2) Uninspiring main characters\n= Jacob and Evie Frye is still likeable, just not inspiring. Most of the dialogues are dull, with Evie sticks mostly to the plan and Jacob being sarcastic and relaxed in an almost lazy way. Interaction with other characters within the game are similarly dull and not exciting. Truly a missed opportunity especially when you have historical figures like Charles Darwin, Alexander Graham Bell and Karl Marx walking about.\n3) Story is lackluster.\n= The story lacks any form of inspiration or excitement. The story is too straightforward without any suspense or fear. It goes on sequence by sequence without anything memorable happening.\n4) Limited Weapons:\n= There are only three type of weapons in Syndicate: brass knuckles (which is awesome! Love fighting with these), cane sword and kukris (basically curved daggers). In comparison to Unity which had a lot more variety to offer, the limited structure of weapons in Syndicate is a letdown for sure, especially as a AC game.\n5) Limited Outfits and Customizations:\n= Apart from specialized skill tree for Jacob and Evie, there really is not a lot to offer when it comes to customizations. The outfits are very limited, and the corresponding color customization is quite boring (color does not pop). I expected more customizations for Syndicate.\n6) Jacob and Evie can't walk normally with their hoods up.\n= Jacob will wear a tophat and Evie will just leave her hood down in normal walking mode. As you trigger the stealth mode (entering the stealth mode), Jacob and Evie will pull up their hoods to accomodate their stealth movements. Although I love the fact that you can bring the hood up and down, at least give us a option to put the hood up while walking normally. I can't stand following Charles Darwin with my hood up while crouching. It looks off.\n7) Buggy fighting system\n= The fighting system in Syndicate is actually pretty smooth. Combat flows and executions, while limited, looks realistic and classy. However, some aspect of the fighting system is buggy. Sometimes a prompt does not appear when someone is about to shoot you, and the next thing you know, you're dead (from higher level enemies). Sometimes attacking an enemy deals no damage, and would get countered instead (almost immediately). I'm fine with a challenging fighting system, but when it bugs so much that it ruins the flow of the game, it is definitely frustrating.\nThere might be something that I missed in this. Sorry Ubisoft, but AC Syndicate is a major letdown for me. Come back better with an AC game in Feudal Japan, with samurais and ninjas.

Personally, black flag is much much larger than london, not to say london sucks, there are cool places to go, the Tower of London, the Palace, The Bank of England. but the map overall is very small.\nOverall, i would reccommend this game to someone who likes the firearm side of the game, and the brutality.

It just feels so satisfying to navigate both of those missions in complete stealth and it usually works out pretty well.\nThe only exception is the officer\u2019s \u201cTake criminals in alive\u201d submissions. I find them clunky and difficult to drag an enemy to a vehicle. It\u2019s designed to just capture the person and drag them through the territory using them as a stealth bubble but I just find myself killing literally everyone in their entourage and knocking them out directly. I just feel like that\u2019s not what they really intended.\nI find myself rather indifferent on the whole leveling and skills. They\u2019re fine and functional and I always enjoy getting new stealth levels and watching skills I use often become more effective.\nThe post-death speeches the characters give are some of the most poetic in the entire series and I quite enjoying hearing the villains speak in every interaction.\nIf I had a major criticism, it\u2019s the same one most reviewers tend to have; Controls.\nThe game can be very, very clunky.\n1) I was climbing to a point to scan the area, assuming I could do the usual leap of faith into a haystack only for Evie to decide not to, and plunged to her death.\n2) I was doing a mission to fight an enemy called \u201cSpring-Heeled Jack\u201d, a quest/area that was in my level range but I would go to die a dozen times because Evie wouldn\u2019t counter for\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I finally defeated him by running around in circles when he popped his smoke bomb, and I still have no idea if that\u2019s what was blocking her ability to counter. Meanwhile, every restart was treated with a tooltip saying, \u201cThis area is too high a level! Upgrade your abilities and equipment!\u201d. It shouldn\u2019t have been. It was level four like everything else I was doing in the area.\n3) There was a neat carriage chase where Evie was standing in the back with Jacob driving, throwing me ammo. It was a practice in quick-shotting but at one point I was able to jump out and attack the enemies. Then I failed the mission because I missed a train I was supposed to jump to. It was incredibly too quickly paced and my attention was more on survival than a subtle (and small) tooltip saying \u201cGet to the train\u201d.\n4) I was doing one of the MANY territory control subquests, with two templars I was supposed to assassinate. I got one, but aggro\u2019d more enemies than I thought I could handle and decided to flee the area in order to regroup and reposition. Well, the game didn\u2019t like this as it respawned the entire area. Leaving that tiny\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665zone was classified as a \u201cfailure\u201d and it completely reset.\nI can\u2019t count the times I\u2019d be shift-sprinting up, down, and sideways through terrain only for Evie to just vault off the side of a building and die on impact because she decided to make a full turn rather than the slight strafe that I intended.\nIt\u2019s during those moments that the overarching flaw of the series rears its ugly head.\nYet? It\u2019s hardly a dealbreaker over a quite enjoyable game. Just the occasional annoyance. I\u2019d still recommend this game, especially if you\u2019re a fan of the franchise but were let down by Unity. It\u2019s a step up.", "hours": 39.6, "username": "WTWR Zydrate", "products": 390, "early_access": false}

Following the path of Jacob and Evie, the main focus will be on character development discarding the usual story that Assassin's Creed was recognized for.\nOn the other hand, while mainly focusing on character build-up, it's the first time in a while that story has a certain direction. Modern day while minimal, leaves rather interesting story left to be explored.\n\nGameplay is the reminiscence of the good old Assassin's Creed 2 gameplay, that brough novelty to the series. Combining exotic animations that Ubisoft games are well known for, new tool to travel called Grappling hook that offers troumendous help in covering the large parts of city jumping from one building to another, lots of gameplay variations and approaches to the target, Syndicate leaves nothing more to be desired. Gameplay although feels fleshed out and redefined is unfortunately crippled with atrocious AI and standard open-world syndrom that most of the Ubisoft games suffer from. Although vital improvements have been made in this part of the game, certain segments of the game are yet to be improved upon.\n\nTechnically improved over the mess that's called Unity, but visually downgraded, Syndicate doesn't bring nothing very interesting to the table on this aspect. Optimisation is far better in this game, which is the result of far less interior areas and decreased crowd volume.\nSoundtrack on the other hand is amazing and brings unique charm and vibe to the London area.\nIf you are fan of Assassin's Creed series, the answer is yes with finally some direction in mind regarding the story and fleshed out gameplay. If you are not, this game offers nothing that would sway your opinion in the complete opposite way so maybe you should rethink your purchase.\nIf you liked this review, please consider subscribing to our curator page here:", "hours": 34.0, "username": "gamerexq", "products": 559, "early_access": false}

Having just wrapped things up with IMO the blandest and least polished AC:Unity, AC:Syn was a huge about face.\nCombat(5/5): A healty balance of difficult and fun(tougher than AC1,2 and BF and more polished that AC:U) You can tell that the issues from AC:U were fleshed out and polished. Less annoying off-screen attack's; ranged shot indicators were much better and combat felt....FUN, something I felt AC:U was very lacking.  Different weapons allowed freedom of combat style and the boxing ring was quite fun.\nParkuor(4/5): Moving around the city was a healthy balance of quick travel, carriages, ziplining and free-running.  All of these(based on how you played) felt they had their advantages and disadvanges and allowed you to change up your playstyle as you saw fit. Free running is still not perfected, but for a game that allowed you to basically grapple on almost any surface, some hang-ups were expected. Overall very good and only had a few times that were frustrating with magnetic hands.\nStory(5/5): Prob one of the best stories I have played for an AC game. The mixing of twins was neat to play to stories, but felt niche rather than needed. It did help to show a bit of character development but wasn't earth shattering or show the same story from different perspectives, just like two seperate stories running parallel.  However interacting with historical figures, unlocking the city and the sheer civilain commentary was spot on and added extensively to the immersive gameplay.\nReal world arc(meh): At this point I do prefer the almost cutscene version of the flash forwards as it was always a bit odd with AC2 how they tried to shoe horn it in.  It did finally have some interconnectivity and some clarity to the future story path, esp if you played the WW1 bit(and got to roll around with Churchy!).\nOverall an excellent addition to the AC series that could sit equally with AC:BF and our love for Ezio aside, AC2.\nGet it and play it, if AC:U turned you sour, try this one on, doubt you'll regret it.", "hours": 59.3, "user_id": "76561198070060558", "username": "Dr Theodor Thrustmaster", "products": 90, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

The nitwit NPCs you round up in their lime green disgusting uniforms that you can spot sneaking around from the other side of town are legitimately meant to be your solution to saving the whole world.\nAnd that's not even the most cringe bit. You legit 'bump into' Charles Dickens in the street and of course he rounds you up to help him write his book, as you would with every dangerous looking bloke who shoved you out of the way and had knives sticking out of every hole. It's the laziest thing I've ever seen writing wise.\nThe final piece of the puzzle in bad writing was the ridiculously diverse cast. I mean it's not bad to see a female character lead, it's not bad to see an Indian character playing central stage, it's not even bad to see various cripples and what not have their day. But all together at once and rammed randomly into the story, it's just a really shallow attempt to tick as many boxes as possible.\nGameplay wise, which is the main reason I play these games after the amazing experience of playing Black Flag, the main feature of swapping between the two main characters is utterly useless. You find yourself in a sneaky subtle situation, and think 'aha! I'll swap to the sneaky character now' but you can't swap mid mission. You find yourself in a football hooligan riot and think 'ok, time to play as the brash brawler character' but you can't swap right now. So Sneaky McGee ends up fighting a gang fight, and Brawler Bro ends up clunkily sneaking into somewhere in the dead of night. It just ruins the whole point of it and you feel like the game is a spoof of itself.\nThe clunky controls and bugs just stop you from ever feeling like an Assassin. You try to sneak round a corner and randomly charge over it. You try to hide behind something and you climb on top of it. You try to assassinate somebody you've somehow snuck up on with your wrist blade and you accidentally shoot someone several blocks away with your noisy pistol.\nI hope this review helps you if you're on the fence. I got this game really really cheap on sale, and to be honest I'll keep it for when I want to muck about in a badly drawn London.

Well ok..\" and had even lower hopes but in playing this game I was pleasantly surprised and as for the grappel? You'll often find you only use it in cases of emergency (Such as needing to scale something quickly while persuing a fleeing target)\nGrpahically it's pretty standard for the series but that's not a bad thing. Industrial London is absoloutely beautiful and it's one of the few cities that actually feels alive in a video game. It's very heavily populated which makes from some reallly fun gameplay and exploration.\nGameplay wise it is also pretty standard except they've clearly moved as far away from the whole \"social stealth\" gimick of earlier games and just plunged head first in to full on stealth. Proper stealth is now a completely viable and worthwhile option. The parkour has been improved greatly. Navigating is really smooth and you can use the grappel gun to cross the street via zipline without ever having to break your little free running experience.\nBefore in earlier games you'd be running across rooftops then suddenly find you had no choice other than to drop on to the street. This made tailing people pretty damn annoying but in this one the grappel gun solves this problem. you're no longer forced to drop to the ground. You can remain on rooftops all sneaky like.\nStory wise it's excellent but if you come here for the present day type story you will be dissapointed as there is very little present day story in this game (Which I prefer to be honest) instead it focuses solely on London in the 1800 and the adventures of Jacob and Evie.\nSpeaking of, they are brilliant characters who contrast each other very well. Evie is quite clearly the better character of the two and I often found myself wanting to get her missions completed before I even touched jacobs. Her interactions with the other characters remind me of the way Ezio interacted with people in AC2 and that's never a bad thing. Jacob on the otherhand has a very kenway like approach to things.\nIt's an awesome game and I highly reccomend it. Hate the whole microtransaction crap they have going on though. You don't need to engage in any of it but the fact that this story focused, single player game has microtransactions shows what kind of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ery Ubisoft is trying to move toward.", "hours": 39.2, "username": "Fawkzi", "products": 351, "early_access": false}

It was a whirlwind.\nI'm going to write a lot about what I liked and didn't like. But first, I'd like to tell you about one of the things I did in this game.\nMy mission was to knock out a guard and steal his uniform. Silly me, I forgot that you could kidnap people and then basically walk them through the front door (as long as you stay like 5 ft from the other guards), so I knocked him out and took his uniform while inside the heavily guarded complex. Nobody saw me, but the next objective was to hide the body. I have to get that 100% sync, and to do that I needed to hide the body in a carriage. There were no carriages in the area I was in, and the only feasible way out was past two guards. They weren't looking in my direction; they were facing the street. Oh, also the other 100% sync objective was to not kill anyone. So my dilemma was: how can I escape past these two guards without killing them with a half-naked body draped over my shoulder? They were too far away to whistle at from behind cover, so I did the next best thing. I put the body on the ground a few feet behind them, threw a smoke bomb, then hurriedly picked up the body and waddled as fast as possible past the guards. And, to my surprise, it worked! But then I was carrying a half-naked body through the streets of London. Anyway, that's just one example of the crazy antics you can get up to in Syndicate.\nSo, to start, I'll discuss the main story.\nJacob and Evie Frye, twins, are the protagonists. They've just arrived in London and are trying to rid the city of Templar presence. Crawford Starrick is the main villain, and he's actually pretty convincing. Better than Unity's villains, at least, whom I could barely even keep track of. Starrick's gang is called the Blighters, and they're crawling all over London. You have to seize control of the boroughs (of which there are seven) one at a time by clearing objectives zone by zone. This becomes apparent when you see the city map. To help with this task, Evie and Jacob form their own gang, the Rooks.\nI like Evie and Jacob. The dialogue for both of them is witty and true to their personalities, which are very different. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that their personalities clash... a lot. This becomes even more apparent and important in the later sequences. They both also play somewhat differently, but I found that either could be used for any side mission. The main story sequences are basically the only points in the game where you can't switch between the twins at will. They both also have different priorities in London, and their individual main story missions reflect that.\nThe main story is alright. I definitely think that Jacob's side is more interesting. If you play the game, you'll see what I mean. I found the missions themselves to extremely varied. The optional objectives really spice things up and you'd be doing yourself a favor to try and complete them. There are few follow missions and eavesdrop missions, which is good. The ones that do exist seem, for the most part, properly placed in the story. I like the unique kills for the big assassination missions. The other characters you meet along the way are also qiute fun and animated. Some of the historical figures are spectacular, and even have their own mission tracks aside from the main story.\nThe side missions are fun and varied. I found the clearing of the boroughs somewhat repetitive. I would have liked fewer Bounty Hunt missions and more Templar Hunts, Child Liberations, and Gang Strongholds.  The Child Liberations were too easy until the more difficult boroughs, where level design was really stepped up. For the Templar Hunts, I like the optional objectives. They really serve to create diversity in situations where otherwise I might just pick off every Blighter with a throwing knife.\nThe Assistant missions (or Companion or whatever) are fun. I haven't completed them all, but they seem varied and interesting. It's a like place where the game designers were able to experiment. One mission I really had fun with was one where Jacob got to shoot a gatling gun on a moving train.\nNote: I also hear that the DLCs (especially Jack the Ripper) are pretty good. Can't wait! If you're thinking of buying a Season Pass, though, I also hear that not all of the DLC that has been released is included, so definitely look into that before you buy.\nThe following paragraphs are a  mixture of compliments and criticism, because there are certainly some things to criticize.\nThe city of London is huge, bigger than Unity's Paris. I loved Paris. It was so beautiful and felt so alive. London feels empty. I get that the designers were going for realism, but things are too far apart. If a game has a huge map, I would prefer that it be divided into clearer segments that you aren't constantly traversing. The addition of carriages and the grappling hook make things a little easier, but still. The grappling hook is not fast enough, and sometimes you are not given the option to attach to certain surfaces. The carriages can be fun, but when you spur the horse (which you will be doing nearly constantly because things are so far apart) the city blurs around you, an effect of the speed. This is cool at first, but after a while it strains the eyes. You wouldn't have to ride the carriages so much if the borough activities weren't so fast and far apart. You spend three or four minutes clearing a gang stronghold, then it's two minutes of uncomfortable, blurry carriage riding. So yeah.\nThese next things will be a collection of random comments and nitpicks.\nI like the free run down option. It's quick.\nKicking open chests is faster than in Unity, where you had to bend down and open them. I prefer this. However, picking locks has been reduced to holding down a button. I really liked Unity's system. It was fun when one time, I opened a level 3 chest with only level 1 lockpicking skill because of pure skill on my part, and a little bit of luck. In a future game, I would like to see the player kick open unlocked chests, but have to play a little minigame to unlock locked chests and doors.\nI like the crafting system, although I never thought much about the individual materials themselves. Maybe if the materials were tied more into the story. Perhaps, if metal was required resource for the next tier of weapons, and you had to storm and seize the mines to get it? Or something like that?\nThe new weapons in the game are kukris, metal knuckles, and cane-swords. I was a little ticked off at first, because I really like fighting with a regular sword (or two), but the weapons grew on me. I prefer kukris because I like the swiping and slicing animations of knife-like weapons, but the brass knuckles felt cool too.\nThe combat! How could I have forgotten this until now? I don't really like it. It takes too many hits to kill enemies. I would really prefer it if they were just harder to hit. I really liked Unity's combat, although I never used the 'dodge' option. The one combat mechanic from Syndicate that I would like to see in the next game is dodging bullets. Or knives or arrows or darts. That made me feel like I had to be more aware of defending myself. Assassin's Creed still doesn't have great combat, and this is especially obvious when you are surrounded by enemies.\nI'm running out of space to write, so to conclude: I really liked this game. It made many improvements, most notably in gameplay, but also in characters and dialogue. London was meh, too big. Graphics were good, but a little cartoony-looking at times. New weapons and crafting were meh. Combat was a little worse than meh. But overall, the game creates some really amazing moments and sequences. The ending boss fight was not great. Too similar to Unity's. The game was great, but too easy. Only a few sequences were really challenging. The end.

But other than that nothing else really works. Like controls. Any one function button does too many things. Example: hanging off the roof of a carriage. Drop down? Press E. Get in carriage? Press E. Hijack and drive? Press E. Right, then. But which one is going to happen exactly when I don't need it to happen? Or, chasing a dude with the intent of tackling him (also E). The police is chasing me. A gun is aimed at me, F pops up to evade bullet. I press F, but instead of the evasion F throws a knife in the back of the guy I was chasing and who was supposed to be caught alive. Or something as simple as climbing a telegraph pole in the WWI simulation. Not gonna happen. Thanks Ubi! All the testing hours really worked out for everyone. I mean... you.\nFight system? Yet another reinvention. 5th time? 6th time over course of nine games... But for the better this time. We have the \"press E\" for counter again. But it's more like a quick time event. Gold flashes above the head of bad guy prompts the counter. The higher level the player is, the more time they have to react. Not bad, I have to say. Kill streaks are back too, to make things easier when facing multiple attackers. At the beginning of the game, when the player might be lower level than most enemies it pays off to just carry a whole bunch of throwing knives and make a pin-cushion out of the really tough enemies. By the way, how come after an enemy was killed by a throwing knife I can't get the knife back when I loot their bodies? Doesn't make sense. Well, what does in an AC game, which feels like a never ending sequence of repetitive gameplay? After nine games we still can't have other activities beside tackling people (who by the way run as fast as a skilled assassin) and opening hundreds of chests?\nThe skill tree is a necessity if you are developing for Ubisoft (from Far Cry to AC, Splinter Cell or Watch Dogs). But in Syndicate it is a little out of place. Our two characters are already accomplished assassins, yet they have to \"learn\", how to double assassinate? Or air assassinate? Or throw a knife? Maybe. But to whistle? Really? It's almost as idiotic as the tattoo in Far Cry 3 to be able to choke and drag someone (haha, in Syndicate we also have to spend points on this very same skill!).\nDuring the aformentioned World War I simulation, the back story is to eliminate the \"sinister cult of spies\". Spies who wear huge templar crosses on their shoulders. It must enhance their spying ability... you know, like showing your face and introducing yourself to every bad guy in the universe (Bond, James Bond). Someone must have been very high on something during the storyboarding phase, there is no other explanation for a script like this.\nOther funny occasion: during a crowd event I save a guy's behind by assassinating two baddies. And what is his reaction? \"Murderer!!!\" Right.\nThe map is not that useful when it comes to inding collectibles. I could be standing right on top of music box (which contains a Secret of London), bombarding the environment with my X-rays and still nada. The item in question not popping up on the map. Never mind! As long as I have helix currency I can buy those missing locations online. And if not, I could still spend some more euros/dollars (on top of all the euros/dollars I spent to buy all the DLC-s, which together cost more than the original game!) to buy more helix from Ubi!\nSocial glitch? I'm sorry, what? Is that what you kids call a facebook user these days?\nThe wall eject is kind of like an erection over the age of 60. When you really need it, you just stand there hanging, and when it finally happens, it just leaves you in your own mess (falling to your death in AC, or tumbling onto a group of angry mobsters).\nSyndicate is very boring. Exactly the same as Unity. Even the buildings are the same. The characters are utterly ridiculous. Evie and Jacob the \"twins\" who have nothing in common except for their height. Must have been two eggs and two fathers... Jacob is dumb and cocky, Evie is an arrogant smartie pants and they are equally annoying in their narrow minded way. Actually, you know what? The only characters who embodied good, righteousness and actually made sense in the AC series are Altair and Connor and perhaps Shay. They behaved like a true assassin should. Disciplined, focused, no charming and condescending bull****. And even though in all of the episodes Templars are made to be the bad guys, Rogue showed that the Assassins are equally bad. Then what's the point?\nThe story is nothing new either (as I wrote before, Jacob and Evie are already assassins, but we don't learn about their past, how they became assassins or who was their master). Templars are plotting to rule/better the world by mostly unethical methods (you know the end justifies the means), but here come the Assassins who kill them all while meeting some of the famous personalities of the period (who wear tremendous fake mutton chops and hulihees, not kidding, the worst facial hair in any game, ever). And of course the nutty professor type is present who invents stuff for them. Like the rope launcher/grappling hook. A ROPE LAUNCHER! Like Batman's. Except this one can't find a target a few yards away, but by turning a few degrees either side it suddenly finds one a hundred yard away! How stupid is that?\nNot only the setting, the environment is similar to Unity, but the dynamic between the male and female lead character is the same too. Except for the love theme, the same bickering, same competitiveness and the different approach to missions is there in Syndicate. The lead females are in fact just males with a feminine look. I liked the strong females who didn't have to talk like boys and fight all the time, killing everyone to be charismatic or appealing. But it seems movie and game writers can only imagine a female lead in a single way.\nThere is no more online gameplay of any kind. In Unity it took me 200 hours to reach the Legend level, in Syndicate they tried to fill the gap with all the pointless collectibles and terrible minigames, like the carriage races (with rubberbanding, undefeatable opponents), escorts and highjacking, so as a completionist I will still spend about the same amount of time eventually. Boring and badly written stuff that completely lacks any entertainment value.\nAnd the famous warning: assassins don't kill civilians. Right. How about not programming a dense population of aimlessly wandering pedestrians on the streets, so when I drive my carriage I don't have to run them over all the time?! Or that Templar Hunt mission where the target had to be killed by explosives. C'mon, Ubisoft! In the middle of a crowded park? Are you insane? And to make things worse, certain perks, which require skills are now have to be done not 1-2-3-5 times in order to get the achievement, but 25-50-75 times! Great. In a game, where succes (even 100 synchronization) largely depends on pure luck and the AI not bugging out.\nI can only recommend this game to hardcore fans, who have steel nerves and like to do stuff to themselves with a cheese grater. You know... in a slightly amusing, but mostly painful way. As the great Ford Fairlane said it back in the day. Playing Syndicate feels exactly like that.\n75%\nPro:\n- graphics\n- fight system\nCon:\n- everything else", "hours": 107.6, "user_id": "76561197970674314", "username": "victorvacendak", "products": 58, "found_funny": 26, "early_access": false}

I experienced the crashing problem a lot of people are complaining about, but it can be fixed by not playing in full screen. Also, if you use dual-monitors, the game might not like that.\nAnother disapointment was the fact that I have a decent computer, and had to play on medium graphics just to get 45 frames.

Here is a quick review:\nPros:\n- London is beautiful, this is AC game with the best graphic\n- Climbing is more fluid and smooth, and you got a new gear: rope launcher which increase the speed of climbing tall building. I have played AC, AC 2, AC:Brotherhood and AC Revelation, climbing was a chore back then.\n- Carriage, better than nothing. And I can hit kids with it, mwahahaha.\n- Combat is a wee bit similar to Batman, but not as polished as Batman, counter and grab is your BFF in this game.\n- More varieties in equipments, from knuckles, kukri, cane sword, outfits, belts, cape, and all of them looks great.\n- Trainsss, I fancy kicking enemies off of train\n- In certain missions there will some different approach to finish/assasinate your target, this is new, and I love it. You can choose from stealth approach, unique kills and/or saving someone who can lead you to the target directly.\n- Jacob and Evie are way much likeable than Connor, they have personality and emotion. And they can smile, not like the zombie assassin Connor\nCons:\n- Killing animation are awesome at first, but at later game, its annoying, especially when you are running from the enemies and wanting to be anonymous, and because of the freaking long killing animation, I got spotted, again...\n- Story is similar like another AC games, piece of eden, shroud, bla bla bla. Its boring enough to make you sleep\n- Lap Race is stupid, they give you and the AI the same carriage with the same speed, it can be frustrating sometimes, but after you get the skill for carriage, it will become easier.\n- The side missions are repetitive. But overall is not as boring as the side missions in previous AC games.\n- Stuttering, I had lots of freeze and stutter, but it can be reduced by setting Uplay in offline mode.\nIf you are an AC fans, buy it when its on sale.

There are so many flaws, technical, narrative, and otherwise.  It's a good thing Ubisoft is taking some time off to figure out what to do with this series, because this is the first main AC game I will have not finished, and would have divorced me from the franchise.  Unity was a technical mess, but I still managed to finish that.\nThis is a bad game with a terrible identity crisis; it is so obvious that it was touched by many teams comprising hundreds of people mostly strange to each other because there just isn't any polish to be found.  It's a plethora of systems and activites all competing to give the player something to do, in an open world context that is of such modern cliche that I can point singly to this title as the one that convinced me the concept is stale yet garish in its desperation to entertain you.\nThe controls have always been iffy in these games, but layers upon layers of iterations on contextual inputs and  finicky movement culminates into such a frustrating mess for Syndicate. They've solved the problem with the unpredictable parkour by just largely deprecating it with the grappling hook; the streets are so wide, and buildings so far apart, to accommodate the terrible horse & buggy \"driving\" system, that the grappling hook is necessary to gain any ground if you want to move or explore above street level.\nThis entry epitomises the series' fast and loose cash-in development cycles by being a buggy, discordant mess.  Frequent crashes, bugs, absurd AI behavior, disjointed narrative -- how they expect the player to invest in the activities being asked of them when it can barely bother to set precedence to do so is just incomprehensible.  I thought about just main-lining the story as I have in the past, but it is so heavily discouraged by flashing the proverbial \"advertisement\" for a new task / activity / chore every 10 feet you move, that trying to even make sense of -what- or -where- the next story mission is can be its own mini-game; especially given that, for example, you may have 3 different \"Sequence 5\" main story quests available at once. Which to pick?  It's like they purposely tried to disrupt cohesion around their narrative just out of fear that the player could possibly feel aimless at any given moment. Instead of guiding the player, they dissuade progress.\nI also love how, instead of teaching me its systems, it would just inform in a tooltip that I have \"51 new tutorial entries\" to look at in the menu. Cool. I feel like I could go on, but I've given up on this game, and prattling on and on about a year+ old game's flaws at this point is just an excercise in self-flagulation.", "hours": 19.9, "username": "Unrest", "products": 1253, "early_access": false}

As is typical with Ubisoft there are minor nuances that can become annoying such as occassional crashing, wonky mechanics, and characters spazing out.

All in all I think this is a grreat game with beautiful visuals and plenty of content.

I dont know how many titels it will take to appear in full glory shooting with lasers down to templars and assassins and laughing like a maniac.

But after several games and after one year after the release there shouldnt be any troubles according that. But beside that, the grafics are absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful face capture of the actors looks realy nice.\nStability: Frame drops are always a topic if you play AC, if I can run BF1 with 90 to 120 FPS stable (all Ultra) and AC runs at 50 FPS, I guess its not only my systems fault.

I loved Black Flag for it's captivating script and story and characters. AC:S can't live up to the magic of Black Flag in that regard (but it tries). On the other hand, a lot of people were down over how OP'd the protag in Black Flag was and how easy it was to just waltz up to a plantation and murder everyone in battle, which kinda made stealth a bit pointless and time-consuming. They've changed that in AC:S--it's a skills-based leveling up system and you're generally pretty weak in battle.\nOh, also UPlay is an awful, awful programme (you need UPlay to play any Ubisoft game... legitimately).

Boo, sequences that require you to play as her idiot brother.\nYou win some, you lose some.\nThe game brings a lot of quality of life perks to the Creed franchise that have kinda been around but not excessively. Restocking tools has been a thing since the first game, however weapon variety dwindled for a while until games pretty much had you just use one thing consistently and nothing else. This gives you a little variety, and some enemies are actually more complicated than counter counter counter finish.  Not all. Some. Travel options like the ascending grappling hook lets you scale tall buildings rapidly, as well as traverse peaks of rooftops as it doubles as a deployable zipline. Its STUPID useful. Basically, if you have buildings, your Spidey Sense + grappling hook lets you set up the kill however you need to. Having a roaming base is also nice, and it generates revenue for you (with a cap) while you are in game and not in a menu. Slightly annoying, not \"immersion\" breaking. Some of the missions are interesting and require a different take on traditional Creed nonsense... but they do get repetitive. I love the fight club missions. Nothing like some old London underground ring fighting where you hear noses crack and jaws break. Gross, but kinda fun.\nPros\n-Its an Assassin's Creed game.

They had some awesome mixtures into the other games in the franchise as well with kenway having a small part in the main story, and the potential for desmond to return at some point in time. I just hope that they make a good modern assassins creed at some point. This game didn't come with all possitives though, I had some issues with the game being that is has a very generic open world collection system, the leveling system seemed to be unbalanced as you would take a very long time to obtain certain items, and by the time you do you already had something better. There was also a depressing lack of difficulty in the objectives placed around the map. End game is just as boring as usual, where in Assassins creed black flag they had an immense amount of end game content this game doesn't offer similar experiences. All in all it is an absolutely brilliant game if you focus on the story and the enjoyable side missions.", "hours": 35.5, "username": "jem557", "products": 381, "early_access": false}

In fact, I'm sure that Ubisoft is seeing constantly diminishing sales  in the AC series and that is why there isn't a game in 2016.  Ubi is probably re-evaluating the series to see how they can increase that bottom line.  Anyway onto the game:\nThis is the first AC game I could not finish.  After 9 hours I just didn't care about the characters, Evie and Jacob, nor the npc's that you run into.  Everyone was just so boring and stock.  Your base is on a train, which is fine. But navigating the train can be a trial in itself sometimes as your toon wont jump from train car to train car if the animations dont line up perfectly.\nThe horse and buggy animations ruin this game.  They litter the streets and are horrific to control.  In fact, the wagon car's were the main reason I couldn't stand the game.  In some missions, you are escorting npc's and random enemies will spawn in their horse carts and start attacking you.  These sequences are VERY frustrating.  It just becomes a cluster \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on who you can attack while driving.\nPerfomrance is all over the place on my rig.  I'm running an AMD 6350 with nvidia 970 and 16 gigs of RAM.  I can run the game on high.  Although after 5 minutes or so, the performance starts to fluctuate between 70 and sub 30 fps for no reason. I'll literally be standing in place and the fps fluctuates that badly.  This h appens with the Division as well, another ubi game.  It's probably my rig, but lowering the settings to low AND going to 720p has the same issue, so lowering the settings does nothing.\nIn conclusion, I found Unity to be more playable then this garbage.  Luckily I got it for cheap off of steam so I don't feel too bad about my purchase.

I think the best part of Assassin's Creed Syndicate is that it uses the historic period of London's industrial revolution and allows the player to get a taste of what life was like for people in that period. Likewise the storyline is not predictable, it manages to incorporate the values of any AC game but at the same time provide a refreshing twist to the tales of the AC series. What I disliked about this soon-to-be-classic game is just the similarities such as the hay bales dives and hard to access menu screen, which is understandable as the creators would still want the game to fit in and match up with the rest of the AC series. Would I recommend this game to someone? Yes I would, if you are on the edge, I would say it is a worthwhile purchase. Will I ever compete this game to 100%? Probably someday, we'll have to see. Haha.

And then, meanwhile, that crazy fable3 stuff I had and the Assassins creed unity met and had a baby. And by some miracle, those two babies met and ****** - this would the **** that they birthed.\nGame-play: Really great, its so smooth and non-buggy I forget its Ubisoft. The game-play really sells the game for me. Stealth is amazing, You toggle stealth now drawing your hood and allowing you to sneak around it looks and feels awesome! Even though most enemies have set paths they still feel alive and may or may not investigate rather than act like robots. The activities are great I LOVE the fist fighting, I turn this game on a lot of time just to bare knuckle box as Jackob for hours. Combat speed is a tad to fast I wish there was a slider for this. Its not that its hard to keep up wit, the free-flow combat is as great as ever, but at its current speed the animations look cheesy and it takes away from them.\nStory wise: If this is your first Assassins creed title or if you never really payed attention to the story of past games you will probably enjoy it. I on the other hand don't enjoy it but it is very entertaining. I'll avoid spoilers but my main hang up with the story is the Templar are outright bad guys for the first time ever as a whole, were In past games they tried to do what they thought was the right thing.\nCharacters: The fry twins have a love hate relationship with me, I love their style, clothes, and way of thinking. But they joke so much about everything! In every situation almost! It wouldn't be annoying if that characteristic was unique to them but its far from that way. Every other character is sarcastic clown type. Even the modern assassins joke at everything and don't take themselves seriously. The Templar's are often cruel for the sake of being cruel and they dress like nazis, its pandering as all hell and vast contrast to previous assassin creed titles.\nParkour: Is smoother now than ever! To bad you get a grappling hook early on and never have to really use it again. I think the grappling hook should have purchasable uses like the rest of equipment. You leave a wire behind when going from building to building so it would make sense to have limited uses at least when used in that manner It's a childish spamable\nmechanic with no real give and take that overlaps the awesome parkour system.\n\"How do I get up there? Oh just use my batclaw.\"\nCons: Simple childish banter, story, characters and game mechanics(Unlimited use grappling hook). Pandering bad guys. To much HUD but most of it can be turned off.\nPros: GAME-PLAY really makes the game. Runs smooth, Very few bugs. Beautiful, London is Awesome, Fist fights, Much more interesting/fun stealth system. Parkour is super smooth.\nI say a lot of bad things about this game here so why do I recommend? Because this game is amazing at what most people look for in a Assassins Creed title. Stealth game-play is amazing if not the best yet with gratifying assassinations, and super smooth Parkour, Beautiful open world environment with lots to do.", "hours": 75.6, "username": "Azasel", "products": 90, "found_funny": 9, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "368500", "page": 103, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-11-03", "text": "UPDATE!!!!!!!!  SLI DOES NOT WORK IN SOME AREAS AND WILL CAUSE CRASHING ESPECIALLY IN SEQUENCE 5 BEWARE IT WILL NOT WORK IN SOME AREAS!!  I spent 4 hours trying to fix this.  Doing everything people told me to do.  Honestly this is a big FU from ubisoft\nI wish there was a \"meh\" choice for reviews... However I do feel like I am a tad biased as I just finished playing Black Flag which IMO is the best Assassins Creed game of all time.  Even beats 2 for me.\nMovement:.  What makes and breaks Assassins Creed.  Why I liked Assassins Creed so much before is for the easy running that just makes me smile like Black Flag.  Making it more complex is even ok more but pressing 3 buttons to jump (certain areas) on my Xbox one controller feels rather tired then fun.  The horse riding is pretty fun but nowhere near as fun as the ships in Black Flag\nEnviroment: Made me feel like I was in Piccadilly underground again.  PTSD of each time I get lost in that line every year I go to London.  Which is good... I guess...  Not as good as the oceans and islands in Black Flag\nStory...  very good, if I go into details I will be spoiling... except you meet like every famous British person from that time period within a 1 hour period such as Charles Darwin, Charles Dickins and Florence Nightingale...  seems kinda forced and was like \"HEY WE ARE IN ENGLAND BOIS\" Surprised we didn't meet the entire cast of Harry Potter and Downtown Abbey within 1 second.  Story is not as good as Black Flag.\nAlso the fighting is rather clunky to say the least.  Like I kill the enemy and I just keep on hitting the enemy for like 5 more times.  That bothers me a lot because I just wanna move the hell or even move to kill my next enemy.  Besides that.. its decent..  I don't like the \"press A\" to go into stealth mode either... Maybe just something to get used to.  But one thing for SURE I will never like is the overkill combat.  Like I kill the enemy in 8 hits but just for pride my character without me wanting to or pressing any buttons hits the enemy about 4 more times.  I liked the fighting MUCH better in Black Flag.\nGraphics... Hit or miss with me... Looks mostly great on 3440*1440p... everything looks great... but theres the cockroach in the soup.  The GOD AWFUL lighting.  I mistaken lighting for white paint sometimes and yes I am running this on ultra maxed out.  One thing that Syndicate does better then Black Flag\nOptimization... Love it   Runs smooth 90 frames on 3440*1440p on ultra maxed out besides some small stuff like AA.  Granted I have a beast system but much better then the 30 frames people with my same specs used to have :) About as good as Black Flag\nChemistry:  Very funny banter.  Jacob and Evie have great chesmitry and I did buy the fact that they were twins and have a love hate relationship.  The characters were funny... But I liked Ezio and Kenway better.   And when they bring up Kenway in the story it felt forced as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 again but made me have memories of the old game and how much more fun I had in Black Flag then this game.  A game should not make me do that.  I guess the bars were WAYYY to high after Black Flag and they could not captitalize on it.\nOverall I liked it... I guess... Very very very very hit or miss.  I know I bashed the game but despite all that, I had fun.  That's what matters and I do not feel bad spending 40 bucks on this game.  This game broke my csgo obsession for a bit.  If you liked 2 then you would love this game.\nGPU: 980ti sli\nCPU: i7 5930k\nMB: X99 Deluxe\nSSD: 1TB Samsung Evo\nHDD: ew\nRAM: 32 GB DDR4 2666\nCPU Cooler: Corsair H110i GTX Liquid\nCase: Corsair 780T ATX Full Tower Case\nPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA P2 1000W Platinum\nOS: Windows 10 Pro", "hours": 14.4, "user_id": "76561198261050079", "username": "udoPolar", "products": 21, "early_access": false}

The grappling hook mechanic with the twins' rope launchers also makes stealth and traveling much more convienient.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 109, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-09-24", "text": "The player will follow the story of twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye. Basically, their plan throughout the entire game is to bring down the Templars, led by Crawford Starrick, in London. Alongside this road, you will meet a number of historical characters you'll recognise, such as Karl Marx, Charles Dickens, Frederick Abberline, Queen Victoria and more.\nJacob's Story:\nThe story is build up in such a way that in every sequence you will hunt one of the Templars controlling London and at the end of the sequence kill them, with the ultimate goal to kill baddie-in-charge Crawford Starrick. The good thing about that is that you will be busy at all times. The bad part, however, is that it's quite bland, there's not much to it. It feels like a checklist of Templars, and you'll just eliminate everyone on that list one by one, without much thought to it. You also don't really get to see much of the bad things these so-called Templars are said to do. Of course there's an exception, but since all the Templars only appear one sequence, the awesomeness this particular Templar (going by the name of Maxwell Roth) has, is only brief.\nEvie's story:\nBeing concerned about the Templars getting hold of a First-Civilisation artifact called the Shroud\u2122 of Eden\u2122, she tries to get the Shroud from the Templars, killing everyone in her way.\nEnding:\nThe gameplay in this game is great.\nRiding carriages:\nIt looks great, it feels great, it IS great.\nWith plenty of different carriages to ride, in different colours as well, this piece of gameplay is perfect. You can hijack any carriage, drive any carriage, be on top of carriages, be in some carriages to hide, shoot the horses of enemie carriages to see the carriage flip. Also I like being able to step out of the carriage at the side I want to step out of it. Driving the carriage sometimes feels a little clumsy, which is perfect considering that carriageriding at high-speed IS clumsy.\nNew \"Gadgets\":\nCombat:\nYou can select 3 different main weapons for in combat, being a cane-sword, a kukri knife and brass knuckles. They all essentially work the same, but have different animations and visuals.\nThe combat itself is the known attack/counter/stun principle, with the addition of a Multi-Kill sequence. The Multi-Kill sequence is a short animation that you can activate once two or more enemies are very low health. Activating it, however, is clumsy. Often have I been frustrated by it not activating when two enemies are low health, or activating only for two enemies when four enemies are low health. When it activates, though, it is quite nice. Aside from that, the combat flows like a river.\nStealth:\nNot much changed. Standing in a group of people that totally don't look like you belong with them will still hide you from your foes, and enemies still can't look through walls, so that's great. However, there is the addition of the so-called stealth mode, which makes your Assassin put on the Assasin hood and makes him/her crouch, sometimes looking really dumb... but it works, so that's nice.\nAssassinating one works the same way it always has, so I'm not elaborating on that. An assassination mission however, has gotten the addition of optional objectives that either make assassinating your target easier, or unlock a special assassination opportunity. It works great, enhances the replayabilty and it's good that you don't need to do them.\nLoading Screen:\nYou are able to run around in the loading screen again, which is better than to stare at a black screen, so there's a plus.\nFor anyone expecting this game's customisation to be anything like Unity: it's not. There's not a whole lot of customisation.\nThere are 3 main weapons, as mentioned afore, with each of them having different variant that look differently and have other stats in terms of damage and so. Same goes for the pistol and the assassin gauntlet.\nYou cannot see your weapons unless in combat, which is kind of a bummer. No cane-walking in London guys...\nThere are some outfits to choose from, but in my opinion, a lot of them look like they originate from a crappy steampunk convention and I think they don't at all look realistically, so I never changed my outfit much.\nThere are some buyable (with in-game currency) and unlockable colours to your outfits, making some parts of your outfit have that colour. Only one colour can be selected at a time.\nBesides the main outfit, Jacob has a belt, and Evie has a cloak, which functions like a cape like Ezio's (although Evie doesn't put the cloak around her like Ezio does when being idle). There are plenty of variant for the belts and capes, but once again, most of them don't really fit in.\nWalking around with a hood on, without crouching like you escaped from the asylum in the game, is sadly not possible (there's a glitch on the Thames that does enable this, though). Instead, in normal stance, Evie walks around without anything on her head, whereas Jacob has headwear: a cap for the first outfit, and a top-hat for every other outfit. Jacob's top-hat has one huge problem though, it has a red band around it which doesn't change colour when you change the colour of your outfit. So unless you dye your outfit red, it doesn't look good.\nLondon looks amazing and is very detailled.\nI myself didn't like the colours used in the game, so I resorted to making a SweetFX preset for the game to give London more of a IMO Londonish atmosphere I like. Aside from colour, the graphics are very good.\nClothing physics are at a new best, but they are on PC locked on 30FPS. Setting it to 60FPS is however easy to do, just google a tutorial for that. (Note that I normally don't really look at FPS, but seeing one 30FPS element in a 60FPS environment is just cringy).\nGreat DLC - not going to elaborate on it, but I really recommend it.", "hours": 165.9, "username": "Rupture13", "products": 193, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

I've played 1, 2, 4, and this one. Of them all I really enjoyed this one and 2. I think 4 has a lot of potential, but I have it on PS4 and just have not got around to finishing it. I played the first one back in the day on the 360 and was severly underwhelmed. I put off the AC franchise for a long time. I played 2 a couple of years ago, and I reallly enjoyed it. I bought 4 last year, just haven't got around to finishing it like I said before, then played this one and loved the setting so much that I finished it.\nI only have a few things left to do to 100% the game, but that will have to wait for a later date, as my graphics card was pushed pretty hard with this game. This game was a very demanding game, one of the most demanding games on the market at the moment. Some may say it's crippling due to nVidia GameWorks on an AMD card (which seems a bit true). It pushed my manually overclocked R9 270X pretty good (mine is the 2GB Vapor-X model from Sapphire) and the processor you run this game on should be no slouch either. Mine was pretty low spec (an AMD FX-4100 overclocked to 4.0 GHz) and it still had some rare hitching problems from time to time. I was able to run the game at a smooth playable framrate of 1600x900 at a locked 30fps. Your mileage may vary depending on GPU and CPU combination, in fact I think my system is a bit bottlenecked with my FX-4100 so if you have an R9 270X and a better processor, you should be all set to do better framerates and resolution.\nThe game plays pretty close to a Batman Arkham game with AC elements mixed in. A welcome addition to the AC franchise if you ask me. The grappling hook isn't too OP to the point that you'll always want to use it VS on foot exploration. The combat is pretty fluid, playing as 2 characters is nice (I prefer to play as Evie personally), and the London setting is very nice in combination with the Anvil engine they used make this in my opinion an underrated benchmarking game and a test to old and new hardware to come (minus all the GameWorks stuff that gimps the AMD cards...) and I really think this is worth a purchase at least on sale.

In one case, despite being an RPG, it lacked variety - in a lot of aspects. One being that there was limited customization in the gear you received, which is fine considering that's how most of the other games are, but it still would have been a nice touch. Second, the gameplay in general was fairly repetetive. The miniquests were the exact same quest but in different locations, which became stale after one or two go-throughs.\nOn a separate issue, the switch between characters was an interesting application that made the game a bit more dynamic. The only problem with that is it took away from the game and made it less immersive. It also made the characters seem less personal and isn't exactly what the game needed.\nAll things considered, the atmosphere was very nice. There were also a lot of new elements that played surprisingly smooth into the game.", "hours": 12.1, "username": "Pangju", "products": 104, "found_funny": 5, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "368500", "page": 110, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-09-12", "text": "I think I am beginning to get sick of Assassin's Creed. Yearly release after yearly release really starts to drain on a man, and while I have only started since AC4, playing all major releases and Rogue since then, the fatigue is starting to kick in for me. Don't get me wrong, it is not as bad as Call of Duty, it is hard as hell to get as bad as Call of Duty, and they are taking a break in 2016 to develop things more, but the basic gameplay mechanics carrying over and over again with not much change is very CoD like. Regardless of that, though, I still played through the latest game, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and finished it through. So what did I think of it? Let's take a look.\nSTORY: There are two stories in here, so first we're going to look at the story we actually care about. You play as both Evie and Jacob Frie, two assassin's and siblings who, after getting fed up with their assassin bretherin, go to London to liberate it from the Templar's and their local leader, Crawford Starrick. The story is the usual AC type deal: you have historical figures you come across and you take part in some historical events int he game. It's fine enough, and while for the first two or three chapters I did not care too much, I do have to admit that later on I got back into it. The other story is the same modern day \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t, and I do have to admit, it is just horribly boring and it takes you out of the good atmosphere the game puts you into. At least back in AC4 and Rogue you're only taken out every 4 or 5 sequences and you got some fun things to do, here you're taken out at least every other sequence, sometimes sooner, and there aren't even any of the cool hacking mini-games. I hope that next time you can just get the option to disable the other story so I can just play the main story.\nGAMEPLAY: Just like every previous AC game in the past, namely Unity. If you don't know Assassin's Creed gameplay by now, I guess I'll sum it up; parkour, assassinations, kind of stealth. They did take out the lockpicking minigame from Unity, which I kind of miss. Instead they added a new grappling hook, which is kind of neat to mess around with. There still is no ship gameplay back in the game and combat still doesn't feel as fluent as it did back in AC4, though it feels a bit better than Unity did, though I don't mind too much I suppose.\nGRAPHICS, SETTING, AND PERFORMANCE: London looks lovely, I have to say. I remember Unity's Paris looking a bit better, but London still looks very nice. Performance was also pretty stable as well, stayed around 50-60, mostly to the higher end of that, and there weren't too many glitches in game. The setting of Victorian London is cool as well, you can go to monuments like Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, which is always neat, and it looks and feels like London would've felt like.\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Evie and Jacob are alright enough. Jacob first came off as an idiot and Evie came off as a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 but after a while I started to like the both of them. You come across some historical figures as always, like Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Queen Victoria, and some more, and it is cool as always to see people like them. Voice acting is top notch as always, and at least here the accents match.\nSIDE ACTIVITIES: There are a bunch of collectibles across the city that most don't care about. There are also some side activities where you can help liberate disticts by killing or kidnapping Templar figures or freeing children workers. I did these to a point but eventually I got bored of them and ignored them. There are some side missions with main historical figures as well, but I didn't do too much about these.\nFINAL THOUGHTS: It's alright. It's Assassin's Creed, I guess you can't expect too much unless there will be ship combat, but that's alright. 7.5/10, I'd grab it if you like Assassin's Creed and you don't care that its the same as the last. If you're new to the series, I'd recommend picking up AC4 or AC Rogue, both are good and they have badass ship combat. This is a decent pick I'd say, though, and if the time period interests you, I say go for it.", "hours": 22.7, "username": "dogboat333", "products": 253, "early_access": false}

NO. After the terrible fate of unity which almost failed in all departments(except graphics) with game breaking bugs, glitches and not to mention its terrible story and characterisation i can see why ubisoft made a game like Syndicate. Through this game the developers just wanted to please the fans and to tell them that the series still has some hope. They have achieved this through some various cool aspects such as the new gameplay mechanisms and adding some very good humour to the characters and story with a beautiful open world . The story is so forgettable that at times you wont even remember the reason for assasinating a person.\nPros\n+ Jacob and Evie frye the twin assassins\n+ Humour\n+ The open world architecture(most accurate depiction of victorian london in industrial evolution)\n+ Gameplay (Brutal, Fast and responsive, awesome kill animations)\n+ PC Port is great with very minimum bugs and glitches\nCons\n- Story (It doesn't truely have one.It just tells you to assassinate random people with little to no reason at all ,again its typical useless ubisoft mission design. I dont know what kinda meds the writters were in during development of the story , Because the story is what made the game series popular in the first place)\n-The Open World Itself (It is just a big beautiful and dumb open world with nothing much to do, It would have been better if they had concentrated more on story telling other than this dumb open world.)\n-Mission design\n-Villians\n-Lack of diversity\n-The rift missions\n-Motion blur (i see what they did there, it makes you care less about the texture pop's and you cannot turn that off)\n-Cloth animation\n-The ending (N0, i dont wanna talk about it. It was that bad)\nIt is just a fun game with no replay value . It is not worth the full amount but if you find it on a sale you can pick it up . It offers you some good gameplay.

Really, really sad that this game was obviously designed soley for consoles and then it was just ported over to PC without any thought to keyboard keys not being pressure sensitive... Nice idea guys. Combat targeting is atrocious to say the least, counter an enemy while in the midst of attacking another enemy; instead of being able to just use your direction keys to switch targets you have to physically look at them with the mouse or your assassin will just continue pounding on the same target. So, in a fight with 5 or more guys, unless you want to just stand in one spot and use counter all day long and watch the same 2 kill animations over and over and over again, you are going to have \"fun\" spinning your head around all day long. Really the last thing that finally made me just quit and uninstall. While free running if you encounter a lantern or other object that is no higher than your ankle or calf your assassin will stop infront of it or stumble and walk in a random direction istead of just stepping around or over something the size of a cat. The \"leveling\" system and gear and upgrades area are so disorganized in my opinion they are horrid.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 116, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-08-03", "text": "Assassin's Creed Syndicate follows the AC formula but in a much more refined way than ever before.\nI think I can best explain what I mean by giving an example: a mission tasks me with assassinating the foreman of a sweat shop. I enter through a window on the top story and hide up in the rafters to examine the situation. I see the foreman on one side of the floor below me and two enemies on the other side. There are some barrels hanging from the rafters that I'm on top of that I can drop on an unsuspecting enemy (or foreman in particular). Now as a long time AC fan I expect the foreman's patrol route to take him right under those barrels (very convenient). So I wait there for him to walk under me, but he never does. His patrol route takes him very close to assassination range, but not quite close enough. So for the first time in an AC game I have to use my brain. I shoot his henchmen on the other side of the room with a hallucination dart that sends him into a rage against the other enemies and the foreman comes to check him out. Before he can get all the way across the room, I cut the ropes on the barrels and complete the mission. This assassination \"puzzle\" isn't a huge difference but it makes the game so much more enjoyable. In the other games each mission was like a connect-the-dots picture where they already connected most of the dots and let you put in the last one or two. I'm not saying the system in Syndicate is perfect: it's not too hard to figure out how to get the foreman under the barrels, but at least it's not like I'm waiting in some bush for the target to walk into that specific bush right when no one is looking. The system can be improved upon but it does make every assassination feel more like a puzzle and if Ubisoft continues with that pattern I think we can expect some much better games in the future.\nIt would've been nice to get something new and exciting in Syndicate like sailing in Black Flag, hunting in AC3, or the brotherhood from Brotherhood. The grappling hook makes getting collectibles feel more like a puzzle but other than that it's really only useful for getting up tall buildings or crossing alleys faster. Driving feels good but with fast travel and the grappling hook you're really only going to be driving if a mission tells you to do so.\nCombat feels fantastic, but it seems like combos and multikills decide when they do or don't want to work (that could be my own fault if I missed a tutorial somewhere). The outfits and weapons have different stats to suit your playstyle, but I found that the bonuses they provide weren't really big enough to notice, even with the late game items.\nHaving two playable assassin's sounds like a really cool idea on paper. In practice it works but it's not as game-changing as the designers probably hoped it would be. Evie has bonuses to stealth and Jacob has bonuses to combat. They also have their own unique active and passive skills. I might be alone on this opinion but I found that the combat is way too easy to ever need a bonus and ended up only playing Evie unless a mission required me to be Jacob. What I think was a HUGE missed oppurtunity was that while playing as one character, the other character is completely absent. What would have been awesome is if you could use the twin that you aren't playing as some sort of super brotherhood member that you could call in to take out or distract a guard. Maybe you could both be in combat and you could set up crazy cooperative moves with each other. Now, they're mostly separated because of narrative but you really shouldn't let the story get in the way of good gameplay.\nThe world design isn't the best or the worst of the series. The different areas of the city have their own general character and charm to them but when it comes down to the smaller details of the world everything starts to blend together. The artistic direction is nice, especially in the more colorful areas. and the graphics are pretty nice.\nThe story is slow and boring in the middle but the beggining is alright and the end is great. There's nothing super special about any of the characters, most of them feel like ripoffs of other AC characters but they're still mostly enjoyable and the main villain is great. The modern day portion hasn't been good since Black Flag and that hasn't changed with Syndicate. Unless they bring back a larger story arc like Desmond's they should really just get rid of the modern story entirely: it doesn't add to the game and it's confusing. The 1800's story is okay.\nI've pre-ordered every AC game since Brotherhood. Revelations was a low point. Unity was a lower point. After playing Unity and hearing that Syndicate would have similar mechanics I decided for the first time not to pre-order. I waited for a sale and bought it at half price. It would've been worth it at 3/4 price. Syndicate hasn't brought the series all the way back to it's glory but it's a step in the right derection. I hear a lot of people say that AC games are rushed. I can see how that's true, but I can also see that Ubisoft is getting better at rushing them. Practice makes perfect I guess. Also I hear that they're working on a new AC game and instead of rushing it, they'll be working on it for a lot longer than usual and giving it the attention it deserves. I'm sticking to what I said before, Syndicate is essentially a much better version of the exact same game that Ubisoft makes every year. If you're new to the franchise, Black Flag is still a better place to start but if you want more after that, Syndicate is worth your money.\nP.S.\nIs the town/villa building mechanic just gone now? I loved it in AC2 and it felt like they perfected it in AC3 but ever since then it's felt like they've been putting less effort into the mechanic. In Unity they had the cabaret or whatever but that wasn't fun to upgrade at all and in Syndicate you have a gang that you can upgrade but I loved having a whole community that did different things for you as you built it up. I mean, having an upgradable base isn't criteria for a good game but I really liked it and I felt like other people liked it too. Maybe there was a demand to get rid of it that I didn't notice. Whatever. Makes me sad.\n[Edit]\nI didn't play Rogue for various reasons and I realize that some of the arguments made here might be made obsolete by that fact, i.e.  \"for the first time in an AC game I have to use my brain.\" I do apologize if this is the case but based on the reviews for Rogue I'm willing to bet that it isn't.\n[Edit]\nI've started to play Rogue and I was absolutely correct in my assumptions about it, its just as mindnumbingly simple as Unity.", "hours": 41.3, "user_id": "76561198087173017", "username": "Phrodo", "products": 219, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 117, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-07-25", "text": "Oh, my. I never thought I'd enjoy an Assassin's Creed game this much ever again after playing the utter disaster that was Assassin's Creed Unity. I'm having so much fun with this game I literally just paused it right now and Alt+Tabbed into Steam to write this review.\nTo sum everything up really quickly: Combine the amazing ambiance and atmosphere of Assassin's Creed II with the sheer fun and satisfation of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and you get this game. It's that good. If you're a fan of the series, buy it right now and don't look back. Trust me.\nFor a bit more detail, read on.\nSome background on me: I'm a monumental, long-time fan of this series. A history major in college, I reserved the first game on Xbox 360 and played it the day it came out in 2007, eager to see what a video game rendering of the Crusades would be like.\n; the unrepentant love I have for that game still exists to this day and even motivated me to visit Florence and Venice multiple times in the past few years. I played AC3, didn't like it much, played Black Flag, loved it.\nThen Assassin's Creed Unity happened, and pretty much drove a rusty dagger through the heart of my love for this series. What an absolute disaster.\n. It caused me to all but abandon the series... Until now, almost a year after Syndicate's release, when I decided to give it a try despite my hatred for Ubisoft and all of the bad will I still hold from being burned by Unity, which still doesn't run on my PC.\nAnd boy, am I glad I tried Syndicate. I have almost no complaints about this game. In fact, it's the best Assassin's Creed game I've played since Brotherhood, and maybe even better than that. It stands up there with Assassin's Creed II as the best game of the series. Yes, better than Black Flag. It's that good.\nThe game is drop dead gorgeous. Ambient occlusion and bloom make the lighting utterly beautiful, and the rain and water effects are jaw-dropping. The character textures are good but not great, but the environment textures are wonderful. Graphical prowess is nothing new for this game, though. What is strikingly better than recent efforts is the sheer immersion of Victorian London. I haven't felt so immersed in an Assassin's Creed setting since Florence and Venice in Assassin's Creed II. The NPC interactions on the street, ambient noise, and weather effects are all amazing. Drunks will sing, people will get into fights, there will be random shakedowns in alleys.There are evocative bills posted everywhere outside and indoor areas have Holmesian decorations like old couches and oil lamps. It's just fantastic the way that good film sets are fantastic; it adds so much atmosphere without you ever really noticing where it comes from unless you stop and serious examine your surroundings. There's so much to talk about that I can't possibly touch it all, but it all combines to a sum greater than its parts and transports you straight into the era in a way that few others games have. Maybe just Dishonored -- And that game was a fantasy only inspired by Victorian London.\nBlack Flag was a great game, but to me it didn't really feel like an Assassin's Creed game. It was more of a pirate game inspired by Assassin's Creed. Edward doesn't even become an assassin until the very end! Yet people still loved it, myself included. Arno was admittedly dull in Unity (a somewhat lesser rehash of Ezio Auditore but without the motivating factor of vengeance and half the charm), so to solve the problem of where to go with this protagonist, the developers give us two playable characters: Evie, the quintessential no-nonsense assassin who is completely dedicated to the creed (a la Altair in the first game), and Jacob, the loose cannon, troublemaking, bar brawling Englishman who isn't a serious assassin, only joining because his parents raised him to be one (a la Edward Kenway from Black Flag). And the system works perfectly. The two characters, between whom you can switch at any time, are the most well fleshed out playable characters to appear in this game in a long time. They each have chemistry, their dialogue is written well, and their voice actors are excellent. Motion capture serves well as they each have unique mannerisms. The skill trees can be individualized between them both, creating a drive to continue on playing and customizing to your liking. And gang upgrades and skill trees ensure that you'll spend hours just gathering money and items, staying up until 2:00 AM because \"I just want to unlock one more thing\", something I haven't felt about these games since the Apprentice missions in Brotherhood.\nThe gameplay itself provides ample opportunity to play it as either a brawler, a pure stealth venture, or something in between. Whatever you want, it's here, and they blend seamlessly into one another. Past Creed games have overloaded the player with too many tools, effectively eliminating any challenge the game poses. This game fixes that by giving you just enough to keep it interesting, but not so much that you're easily able to breeze through everything once you have all of the unlocks. The stealth sequences give you just enough tools to remain challenging, and the combat is less Assassin's Creed, more Batman Arkham, which is a good thing in that it provides depth to the experience. And traversal is easier and more satisfying than ever thanks to the hookshot. This game is so. Much. Fun.\nThe soundtrack is also noticeably better than recent entries into the series thanks to Austin Wintory's superb score of both subtle ambient tracks and crashing woodwinds and strings for the battle scenes. Again, the best score in an Assassin's Creed game since Jesper Kyd's watermark score in Assassin's Creed II.\nIf I do have one complaint about this game, it's the control. The improved traversal from Unity is here, but for some reason the Frye twins seem to respond to change of direction a bit more slowly, and deciding when to free run up is sometimes clunky. Everything feels more muddy than in previous titles, which can adversely affect some stealth sequences.\nIn order to assuage any worried about Ubisoft's bad PC ports in the past, I will say that this game runs superbly on my rig. This is the best running Assassin's Creed game I've played since Brotherhood. Even Black Flag was a bit more shaky. Unity ran around 50 FPS on high settings on my machine, this game is locked at 60 FPS with all settings maxed and I've seen very few bugs outside of normal fare for open world games.\nAnother plus is that, while they're still there (unfortunately), Ubisoft has greatly toned down the in-game microtransactions from Unity. Instead of popping up all over the map like in Unity, now they are relegated to being only an option in the menu, easily ignored. As a completionist I still get\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665off thinking about how annoying those microtransaction icons were in Unity. Despicable.\nTo sum it up: This is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing great game. It absolutely breaks my heart that this title was completely overlooked and did poorly financially upon release all due to Ubisoft's screwing the pooch and releasing Unity as a broken mess when it honestly could have been a good game with another year of development.\nIf you're a fan of the series and you're in the mood for some face and neck stabbing then you have to purchase this immediately. Don't wait like I did. It's worth an immediate buy. If you aren't a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series and you just like open world action games like the Batman Arkham series, give Syndicate a whirl. I bet you'll like it.\nGameplay:", "hours": 66.5, "username": "Gian Lorenzo Bernini", "products": 234, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

You've got a neat little grapple tool that functions much like Batman's in the Arkham games, though you can't use Syndicate's unless you've got both feet down so it can ge tricky to get it going. They finally got stealth perfect by having a dedicated button that swaps between stealth mode and what I call \"Imma kill a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 mode\". Assassinations are fun and actually have multiple opportunities now, allowing more freedom. Hell, the entire theme of the game is freedom. It's less linear than previous AC games. It just basically says \"here's your tools, here's what you must do to upgrade them, here's what's wrong in London. GO!\" and the ability to plot your own course leads to some relatively fun stuff, although can cause plotholes once in awhile. Speaking of the plot...\nThe main characters are Jacob and Evie Frye, twin assassins. Primarily, I appreciate the fact that they are assassins right at the start of the game. Out of the now 7 main games, this only the Fourth that doesn't have a large portion absorbed by how your new protagonist became part of the Assassins, and the first to boast that within the last 4 releases. The Frye's have a very take-charge attitude. After the first mission, they decide to leave their mentor and go rescue London, with different ends. Jacob starts a \"necessary-evil\" type of gang called the Rooks, which is used mainly to screw over the Templar-owned gang called the Blighters. Meanwhile, Evie focuses on more Assassin stuff such as this game's Macguffin. They have very different styles of doing things, and while their banter is great early in the game, they spend very little time together after and all interactions are hostile. I want to like these main characters, and I did at first, but they went from being arguably the most \"in-control of our own paths\" characters in the series to actually incompotent later on. Mid-way through the game there's a decent plot twist. My problem is it results in the game's main villain (more on him in a bit) and the person that has most recently \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed over Jacob both in the same room, totally vulnerable. Rather than running in and stabbing them, or even poking his gun through the huge hole he was watching through, Jacob lets them both go without making his presence known so he could get revenge on the double-crosser later. That made me legit angry. Because of his pettiness, the game is actually twice as long. They talk about Jacob's character flaws alot, and this one is glossed over. Evie and Jacob also spend several missions talking about how \"Feelings can never interfere with the objective\" but then she lets them do just that a few missions later. That brings us to.....\nThis game portrays the Assassin thing as very black-and-white. It's no longer simply just \"You killed this chapter's antagonist, good job!\" but early in the following chapters you see the effects of this person's removal and how these high up people just disappearing can cause huge amounts of trouble. They don't handle it terribly well though\nSequences 5 to 8 I believe (of a 9 sequence game) can be summarized with the following:\nEvie and Jacob go on adventures, Jacob kills somebody to end the sequence, then Evie spends the first bit of the next sequence dealing with the reprocussions while Jacob does more adventure. They make this big deal about how really all of Jacob's major kills endanger London. There's even this exact conversation:\nCharacter One: England is doomed!\nEvie: What if I put these plates in here to fix it?\nCharacter one: That'll help slightly...\nEvie: THEN ENGLAND IS SAVED!\nIt becomes an annoyance, really. Every time Jacob scores a Templar kill, which he is supposed to do as an Assassin, Evie cleans up the mess it makes within one mission afterwards. Roughly half the game's plot is spent on Evie growing increasingly annoyed with Jacob's lack of foresight, but the issues are she cleans it up so effortlessly and then it's never mentioned again. On top of that, he is actually killing templars. Of the 9 major templar kills in the game, Jacob scores 7 and shares the final with Evie. Evie spends the game searching for the Macguffin, but she never makes any real progress until Sequence 6 of 9 or so. She spends a large portion of the game\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665at Jacob for detracting from her search but even when actively on it she doesn't accomplish much. Also, the game has a problem with this whole \"Cleaning up after Jacob is taking so much of her time\" thing. Jacob has all of his own missions, then still has the time to show up in a few of Evie's, even being an active supporter in a few of them. You can't talk about how one protagonist has little time to complete her objective and clean up after the other when the other protagonist uses the same amount of time to eliminate major players, run a gang, and still show up to assist her. The reason they finally reconcile at the end of the game is because they both stab the main villain at the same time. Not even joking. After entire sequences of them becoming enemies, them doing the very thing they showed up in London to do fixes it. It just seems very shoe-horned in because we need our happy ending.\nI absolutely love this villain. He's the most human and natural one we've seen in any AC game. Period. We actually see him after every major move the protagonists make. We see him mourn his closest allies when they fall, like he actually cares about them as friends. We see him become angry when critical blows to his organization are struck. We see him celebrate the few occassions things go well. When inflation hits and his soldiers are no longer making enough to get by, he actually gives them raises. He makes you re-think the black and white view the Templars have in previous games.\nThis game has a few glaring plot holes", "hours": 36.9, "user_id": "76561198048643232", "username": "Tuffcooke", "products": 414, "early_access": false}

Yeah, that one was a bit off-topic. Mostly accusing Ubisoft of continuing on with their nasty parkour elements when they are standing on a treasure trove of piraty game mechanics!\nLong Version\nWell, i have officially made it through 1.7 hours into this game; which is barely past the game's proluge, i think. Anyways, I have two main points to make about this game, and I'll let it know now that of all the Assassin Creed game's i've played, i've only played the first (hated it), and Black Flag (loved it, but for very different reasons); this one, of course I'm going to say NO!\nSo, onto point one. The GAME MECHANICS!\nI'm sorry, but for a game that focuses so heavily on parkour and a series that has had a lot of experience doing it, I can't help but feel like these mechanics are too bogged down by context controls to the point that I feel like i'm playing a rail shooter with Quick time events. The mechanics are much too choppy as they are constantly nagging that you need to press buttons in a certain manner just to jump down from a considerable height. I don't remember that from either the first or Black Flag.\n[*EDIT] One game that made parkour a lot of fun and is much simpler is Dying Light:  Which has co-op and you can even set it up to allow invading players to attack as zombies (I've never got involved with that though).  However, Dying Light doesn't do much in the stealth department if that is what you're looking for.  Probably other games out there too that do a better job at parkour, but I'm honestly disapointed with what Ubisoft provided here.\nSecond Point is just a personal nit-pick and probably something that might have resolved itself if I continued playing but I gotta say that I don't care about the twins. I wanted to play the other guy, the head honcho and bad-\u2665\u2665\u2665 (Not the assasin in white). These two were, likeable, but they had this annoying aire of being incredibly novice. I felt like they would suit a better purpose as support characters or, perhaps, a co-op mode! That would be ridiculous though!\nMy experience with the previous games tells me the story would be interesting and I wouldn't have minded getting into it more, but the gameplay itself felt dry and boring.\nNow, why did I like Black Flag so much then? Because it had pirate ships and a whole seperate game mechanic that wasn't completely revolved around the dry, badly done parkour and obnoxious quest expectations (chasing a guy who is not allowed to see you but you can't be more than 5 feet from them or else you've \"lost\" them). Indeed the quests in black flag were an utter bore to me and needlessly frustrating. Except for the pirate ship bits!

I found that on a lower card you are much safer lowering your resolution to 720p to get a very well deserved solid 60fps on medium graphical settings which still looks good. With a higher end card you're gonna be able to run this game incredibly well. Overall it is very well optimised.\nCons:\nSome recycled animations from previous games.\nFuture/Current story lacks depth, insight and any kind of interesting aspects.\nAt least one story mission is a tail or listen mission which can be ended by silly NPC design paths.\nVery lost plot path in the beginning previous tutor/assassin never checks up that you went to london throughout the whole story.\nUbisoft AI system... (You should know that every ubisoft game runs with AI that thinks like a mildly autistic frog with no legs)\nSide mission very dull and repetitive\nAbility to buy ingame money with a microtransaction store.\nOverall the whole game was great, I enjoyed the main story, I found the side missions rather boring so I decided to leave them for now, It is definitely a game I will return to to maybe do some of the side quests. Great experience for anybody with a well optimised engine which will run well on budget cards. Well worth a buy if you're looking for stealth or rough and tumble gameplay.\n-This is a review of the game leading up to the end of the main story. Any missions or equipment that is unlocked after the final act is not in my opinion whatsoever that must be judged yourself or with others reviews.\n\"Together?

With claims that the franchise is growing stale and 2014\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity, the franchise needs to win its fans back. Does it, though? As a huge fan of the series who detested ACIII and Unity, I think it did.\nSet in 19th century industrial London, the story follows the twins Jacob and Evie Frye on their quest to take a mega baddie Templar whose name I totally forgot. Does that say enough about the story? Not really. The story of Assassin\u2019s vs. Templars is getting a bit stale by the 9th entry in the series and the game does not offer anything new in that regard. What it does though is throw us right into the action of that conflict without dragging out the first part of the game by giving us how the twins joined the creed or any backstory. I personally found that a bit refreshing.\nJacob and Evie\u2019s personalities and methods are different. He likes to use brute force and go out with style while she likes to plan ahead and do things discreetly and stealthily. Their banter is one of the highlights of the game\u2019s narrative, I just loved watching the two of them go at it on screen. Their journey to take down the Templars in London makes them cross paths with historical figures such as queen Victoria, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin. The two also form a street gang called the Rooks in hopes of battling the Templars\u2019 gang which controls the city.\nThe game does nothing to progress the modern day story just like Assassin\u2019s Creed titles since Black Flag.\nOverall, the story was nothing groundbreaking yet fun to experience with a slightly disappointing ending.\nFor the first time in the series, you control two characters that you can be switchable at almost any time. Their differences are stark since Jacob is more of a brute that can sustain a great deal of damage while Evie is better suited for stealth missions. The Assassination missions are a highlight in the game. They are grand in scale with a number of ways to achieve the end goal. I think that they can be compared to Hitman Blood Money\u2019s missions though a bit smaller.\nOut of all the missions that I played, only one of them was a boring tailing mission! Outside the game\u2019s main missions, there are a plethora of side missions including the 7 districts to liberate from Templar influence. Each district has 4 different kinds of side missions you need to complete in order to liberate said district with a finale consisting of an epic gang war.\nAs for the movement, the parkour mechanics improve upon those of Unity and they do a great job at it. Free running has two dedicated buttons now; one takes you up while the other one takes you in the opposite direction. This new system is great, but only when it works. I found myself having to climb all the way down a building and climbing back up just get over a small gap thanks to the lack of a jump feature. Yes, you cannot jump since there isn\u2019t a dedicated command to do so. The new rope launcher is a welcome addition to the series and is actually one of my favorite gadgets. It makes traversing the streets of London faster and more fun. Think of yourself as a 19th century Spiderman. Drivable carriages were also a welcome addition since the city is so large (30% larger than Unity\u2019s Paris). I did find one odd thing about climbing, though, it feels as if the player can only move in a grid because sometimes I would try to climb certain objects that were normally climbable in previous AC games but couldn\u2019t as Jacob (or Evie) would just skip them and go over them.\nCombat is finally fun to play and not only to watch! Much needed improvements were made to the combat which makes it fast, fluid, and most importantly, fun. The brutal combat animations make Jacob and Evie look as badass as they dress.\nIt is important to note that the game is the first Assassin\u2019s Creed title not to feature any form of multiplayer since Assassin\u2019s Creed Brotherhood. To be honest, I don\u2019t really miss it.\nThe game is beautiful to gawk at. The busy streets of London feel alive with carriages, workers, children, merchants and all sorts of people roaming around. Gang wars also come to life with two dozens of NPCs battling it out while you mow them down with great combat animations and executions. Facial animations were also great except the weird and quirky facial animations of gang members. Location wise, London itself is a good location for an Assassin\u2019s Creed title, but I feel that the European locations are growing a bit stale since I feel that they are mostly the same.\nVoice acting is superb that, especially Jacob and Evie\u2019s which makes their banter even more enjoyable. Music is atmospheric and fits the game. Other than that it isn\u2019t as memorable as ACII\u2019s or Revelations\u2019.\nTL;DR:\nPros:\nCons:\nOverall, Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate is a solid new entry in the franchise that is better treated as an individual game since it does nothing to advance the overall Assassin\u2019s Creed story arc. The game features improved combat and parkour and a fun, self-contained story.", "hours": 25.0, "username": "Sala6a", "products": 689, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

However the Main game was fun and fresh and i'm still playig it now as i love the story, the characters and perioid. so id buy the main game but no dlc. hope this helps you :)", "hours": 48.4, "user_id": "76561198133465739", "username": "benjit", "products": 28, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "368500", "page": 121, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-07-07", "text": "[disclaimer] I have played all AC games on a powerhouse of a pc, with mouse and keyboard. I have not played unity, since the PC port was a broken mess, so that's my perspective.\nLet's start with a TL;DR: This game is the most assassin's creedy game of all time. It does all the things the others did really well, but not much else. Excluding black flag, that one spiced things up. As a fan of the series you get what you expect and as someone who has never liked them you will not like this one either. However for someone (whoever that might be) who has never heard of them, but is really interested in playing as an assassin in times gone by, this is the best one in the series.\nCombat system:\nFighting is mostly the same as always as far as your inputs are concerned. You can hit things, shoot things, break their defense, we have seen all of it in the previous titles, only this time we got a level system so fights can actually get tough if you are in the wrong part of town early on. the Introduction of a near-death-state allows you to set up multikills in a real fun way. Animationquality is superb as usual and due to the addition of the second main charackter you get twice as many special animations. Great job ubisoft, killing thugs has never looked better in an AC game. I will however say that I still think that their fighting system is shallow and doesn't hold up to the likes of Prince of Persia (the good ones), Dark souls, Devil May Cry and all the other relevant fighting systems out there. At least it is more fun than unmodded skyrim is, but I won't give credit for that, Skyrim's combat is dated, clunky and uninspiring.\nSkill Tree:\nThis one is the only real innovation to the series. (maybe it was in unity, but I'll continue to ignore unity because I don't play broken games) At first I thought: \"Big whoop so they wen't pseudo rpg on us. It's propably gonna be as much of a sorry excuse for linear progression as the introduction of currency was in AC2.\", but they actually put some effort into this system. The upgrades you can get here are really fun for the most part, while of course balanced for casual players, so some of these are pretty op. We do have the occasional \"get more flat HP or deal more flat DMG, but some of the others include auto loot on takedowns, heal on multikills or various upgrades to the eagle vision, however most, if not all (can't quite remember sorry) of those were standart for \"Revelations\" Ezio. I guess not everyone is a Florentine Master, so they have to work for it. Also due to the 2 charackter model you don't have to decide wich playstyle you wanna go for. Evie naturally builds as a sneaky Sam-Fisher archetype, whereas Jacob is more of a Brawler. They do have a few unique upgrades each, so this setup is recommendet, but you can totally go Sneaky Jacob and Brawler Evie if you so desire. I went with the standart though, because of charackter flavour.\nEnemies:\nMuch like in Revelations, we have different kinds of guards. This time is the Blighters, a templar-sponsored group of thugs, the coppers, who are... well, coppers and of course the actual templars who are kind of on the side of the blighters but tougher and rarer.\nFor the first time ever, some of them are actually challenging (No, I didn't think the templars in AC1 were a challenge, hidden blade counter was 1hit). At least early on if you are underleveled. Unfortunately the very welcomed spike in difficulty gets eliminated more and more, the further you go down that skilltree of yours, until you eventually become the superhuman angel of wrath we know and \"love\" in the series. Yeah, opinions devide on this matter.\nSetting:\nGot to say, I got a softspot for victorian London. The place is oozing flavour, of course rebuilt authentically, as we are kind of getting used to with AC games. Britishness all over the place, Jacob even gets a Tophat in one outfit, there are sword canes as weapons and so many more things. Great Job, I love it.\nSoundtrack:\nSuperb, my favorite in the series, however I'll shut up about it, since people apparently have differen't opinions on this one too. Almost like there are different taste of music than mine. Strange.\nMain Charackters (Jacob and Evie):\nJacob is your stereotype wisecracking, gunslinger. Starlord esque. A bit clishee, but likeable. He also is a dummie sometimes, but in a fitting way.\nEvie is more serious, sneaky and traditionally Assassin-like. An Altair (towards the ending of part one) kind of woman. The two of them clash in cutscenes and have a littlesibbling rivalry every time they meet.\nNot my favorite Assassin's but better than Connor for sure.\nTheir outfits and moves however are absolutely gorgous.\nThe two work well together and it's so much fun to see them be a team. Unfortunately for some reason the story decides to pit them against each other for the majority of the time. Wasted potential\nSidecharackters:\nI found the sidecharackters to be some of the worst ever in the series. I don't remember a thing henry green did, nothing any of the historical charackters said or done sticked to my mind and even though, they were again brilliantly researched and pseudo accurately represented with some of their quirks and charackter traits, I just don't remember any of them as strikingly interesting, even though I played every single of their side missions. No Idea why, maybe it is because I got bored by all the busy work some of them asked me to do. They just felt like nicely coloured vessels for sideplots, that had no real reason to be in the story other than AC games got to have historical charackters. None of them come close to how great Leonardo was in AC II.\nI just remembered one exception: Maxwell Roth. He is a joker type charackter, an anarchist and criminal. He was the most fun antagonist and also the only fun one. Actually I liked him quite a bit and I ave no Idea why I forgot about him earlier. Guess I was just thinking about the good guys.\nStory:\nWell, I was so engaged by the dynamic between Evie and Jacob. They are superfun together and work really well as a team. Sadly, the story spends like 99% of the time, keeping them apart. It wasn't fun for me to see the rift grow and eventually close between them, because we all knew from the start, that there would be a happy ending. As a result we don't have tension and we don't have the amazingly fun interactions between the charackters that do shine trhough every now and then. Sadness. Could have been great but is sort of ok in the end. I will not spoil more of it, but there isn't much to spoil, it's rather standart for an AC game and please don't get me started on the real world stuff. I think the fact that the real world part of Black Flag, where they made fun of themselves, the gaming industry and \"Abstergo\", their big bad being their best ever sais it all. In my opinion it is useless shovelware to the max again.\nMain Missions:\nThe main missions have an interesting spin on them too. Most of them offer loads of ways to complete them, but a few, storyrelated ones with extra spice and specialties. Great job, they are less handholding and more intersting than ever. I don't want to spoil too much, just enjoy them.\nSidemissions aka Busywork:\nWow. I don't even know where to start with the open world missions. in my opinion, they are beyond bad. Mind numbingly repetetive, busywork without any redeeming qualities. Brotherhood and Revelationsesque you got to free London, district by disrict, only this time it is way more work and none the better.\nPros\nGreat Setting,great soundtrack, fun new tools, Skilltree, Levelgate for enemies, the siblings are fun together.\nCons\nMore of the same, mindless busywork, no pirateships , the siblings are constantly seperated.", "hours": 79.4, "user_id": "76561198019623636", "username": "Tharrock", "products": 105, "early_access": false}

It has become my second favourite behind ACII for many of the reasons I enjoy that legend of a game. It took me a while to get going with it because within the first couple of hours the game crashed and this is apparently a recurring problem with playing the game on PC. However, I ended up enjoying the game so much that the infrequent crashes (which would only happen after certain loading times) no longer became an issue for me. I greatly enjoyed all the characters in this game and loved the humour throughout. Jacob and Evie are fantastic main characters and I hope to see more of them in the future. Likewise, the villains in this game felt like they had a lot of character and individuality. The combat feels fast and fluid, same with the free-running. The city of London looks stunning and is a lot of fun to traverse. However, although I was satisfied with the story and \"ending\" it certainly won't satisfy everyone. It doesn't grip you as much as ACII but it still delivers. This game feels much more light-hearted than other Assassin's Creed games and I thought this was a welcome change. The side quests were a lot of fun and included interesting historical figures such as Charles Dickens and Charles Darwin. Overall, a very enjoyable experience and a game I will continuously return to.

Fighting's become a lot easier than it was in Unity, bit too easy if you ask me, escaping a fight, though, is now kind of a challenge. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but enemies can apparently shoot through walls. Which is not cool. At all.\nThe city is gorgeous and climbing Big Ben actually beats sneaking around inside Notre Dame. The carriages are rather fun, too, until you get to the carriage races, which are based less on skill and more on luck and get very frustrating VERY quickly. My favourite part of the game though, was meeting historical figures, because those in 19th century England are better than Leonardo da Vinci in AC 2.", "hours": 99.7, "user_id": "76561198087738826", "username": "sunshineno1", "products": 75, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

However, all what you can do in Stealth mode is crouching. Could have been improved with more moves like taking cover and do a quick roll between covers. Or simply ditch the Stealth mode away since AC was never about being sneaking slowly.\n- Driving carriages is good for reaching far objectives in London. It is however not that fun to drive. The chase scenes are awkward and unrealistic.\n- The weapons and fighting style is probably the weakest in the whole series. It feels unresponsive and when surrounded by too many enemies it just become a mess and random.\n- The Skills Level Up menu is probably a new thing to this series (not sure if this was in Unity). You now earn XP to unlock points and assign them to a specific skill. However, this feature is completely unnecessary. It simply means the assassins in this game are unskilled. They could've just improve the characters every new chapter just like Edzio or Altair when they unlock new weapons or new skills.\n- Microtransactions. While you really don't need them, but the idea of pay-to-win in a single player do annoy the player and takes him out of the experience.\n- The game feels like it is missing a plot. If you want to play it for the plot, just watch the ending straight away and skip the game.\n- Too many repititive side-missions. In order for your \"gang\" to control an area, you will have to do 4 kinds of missions again and again: Kidnapping a wanted gang member, assassinating a templar officer, freeing enslaved children or simply killing every gang member in a specified area. You get to repeat this process dozens of times. The only challenge here is that some enemy gangs can be on a level higher than you which they will be able to inflict higher damage on you and they will have longer health bar.\n- The Train Hideout does not feel as impressive as AC2 hideout or as useful as AC4 ship. A huge missed oppurtinity here.\n- Weak cast of side-characters on both the Assassins side and the Templars.\nThe game has been played on GeForce 780 GTX (3GB of GDDR5) with i7, 12 GB of RAM and Windows 10. I tried the game on both 1080p and 2k resolutions. The game do not maintain 60fps easily as I had to lower some graphical settings. Meanwhile, Witcher 3 (another open-world game) do run better on my machine. I think the game is not optimized. However, it do run better than AC:Unity. I also had multiple crashes that usually happen after the end of a chapter or some quests.\nHave you ever tried copying ideas in Art class from the next guy? AC Syndicate feels just like that. It tries to copy features from other games like Arkham Series, Far Cry, Hitman, GTA and so on. Ubisoft should have taken its time and re-perfected the Assassin formula just like they did with AC2.\nIf you are new to Assassin's Creed, avoid this game and get one of the older ones (I recommend AC1. AC2, AC4).\nIf you did not like Unity then you would say the same to this game.\nIt is safe to watch the ending and skip this game.", "hours": 31.9, "username": "Kasser", "products": 316, "found_funny": 12, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "368500", "page": 132, "page_order": 5, "recommended": false, "date": "2016-06-04", "text": "Biggest AC fan from the beginning, played the first games like crazy. Quality started to decline dramatically with Revelations and hit a low with Unity. That brings us to Syndicate.\nI had huge hopes for Syndicate. It seemed like they were trying to improve a lot of things. The gameplay did actually improve quite a bit. It's like the Assassin's Creediest Assassin's Creed in that matter.\nHowever, the story is hard to follow, because you don't get emotionally attached to the main characters a lot. They're trying to pull of the same things over and over again, but they just aren't pulling through. The problem with the series is that they try to get so much detail by adding open houses, a lot of foliage and decoration and a lot of historical facts. They fail to add detail to the characters and especially the people surrounding you, though.\nTake Black Flag as an example. The Jackdaws crew was just there. You neither had to find a steerer, a cannoneer, a carpenter nor the bloody Spanish cook, that was mentioned in the book. Image you would've had to actually put together a crew and take actual care of your men or women. The same goes for the rooks in Syndicate. You have a couple of important persons on your team, but they're too distant like the other captains in Black Flag and it's not like you'd actually care about that fat lady in the chair.\nAlso, you don't get attached to the main characters. In Assassin's Creed III you had at least a little attachment to Connor. You saw his parents, you saw him growing up, you experienced his childhood horrors and his relentless way of becoming an Assassin. Sure, you cannot top Ezio in Assassin's Creed II. You experienced the whole process of him growing up from a cocky teenager who didn't know anything about the world to a caring and calm adult. Whilst you knew every single one of your allies by doing stuff with or for them. The recent AC titles lack this sort of dedication to the main characters.\nThen there's just too much content. Ubisoft emphasises the amount of playable content in the latest AC games, starting with Black Flag. According to Ubi, you were able to spent 80 hours in Black Flag until completion. Well, but do you want to? At least 40% of the completion rate is just farming chests and other collectibles. This part became even bigger in Unity, where you could find almost ten different items throughout every single district. In my opinion that is no content at all. It doesn't affect me, my playstyle, the story line or the character development. If you're on the first playthrough and try to get full sync in the missions, you can make it through Black Flag in 16 hours and that is fine. But advertising and fooling players into buying the game through a cheap trick like posing collectibles for content won't make for a great game.\nAnd finally the technical part of Syndicate. Making a game that's full of details and that has sophisticated graphics is one thing. Making a game that can be run on a normal PC or console with a smooth experience is another. Not being able to play a game on full settings has been used for ads once, especially with Crysis. But that time is long gone. I've been trying to run Syndicate on a 4x3,5ghz processor, 16gb HyperX Fury and a GTX980 and I'm actually getting bluescreens. Bluescreens? That was the first bluescreen I've ever seen on the new Windows! Even on medium graphics it's just slow, buggy and glitchy. Especially horse carriage missions are horrible. Just like in Watch Dogs, the game cannot load the next parts of the map fast enough.\nWell, Mr Smartass, can you even make a game that meets your tremendous demands? Yes, you can. Take the Mass Effect series for example. Mass Effect 3 looked pretty good at that time and it ran smoothly even on a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing laptop. I've played the demo at the CeBit a couple of months before the launch of ME3. All they offered us were ASUS gaming laptops, but you were able to push settings to max and get your full 60fps without the computer even getting loud. And you were attached to all those charakters throughout the entirety of the series. You will remember Admiral Anderson, Liara and Garrus for the rest of your life, wont you? But you'll have forgotten about Jacob and Evie long before you play your last games.\nYou don't need the best graphics, the best story or the best gameplay to make a great game. All it takes is a good idea and the best you can do out of it. The latest games of this series however, Assassin's Creed Syndicate included, just lack passion and heart. And if you know a little about the development of these games, then you know why.", "hours": 37.4, "user_id": "76561197963541953", "username": "R\u00fcdiger R\u00fcgenwalder", "products": 182, "found_funny": 21, "early_access": false}

And in the end, I just can't because the substance that makes a game fun just isn't there.\nThen again, I loved all the games through Black Flag, including ACIII, so maybe I just have different tastes.  I'm also not a city person, so being stuck in the same city, where every rooftop looks pretty much like every other rooftop, is just plain boring to me.  In ACI through Black Flag, I always felt like I was discovering new places and meeting new people until the end of the game.  A few hours into this game, and it feels like I've seen all there is to see, even when I go to new areas.  The missions are repetitive, the side quests lackluster, and the characters wooden.  Altair had his arrogance, Ezio had his charm, Connor had his anger, and Edward had his ambiguous morals, and all these characters had their traits and their transformations linked to their stories.  Evie (is that even her name?  I can't even remember) and Jacob (which I only remember because it's written in the game description) are so generic they're interchangeable and forgettable.  There's no backstory, no compelling reason for them to fight the fight they're fighting, and it makes for a dull tale.  I'm actually more than a few hours into the game, and I'm probably just going to give up on it because I don't care.  I'm not interested.

Progression in the game seems fine, I enjoy the stealth mechanics. The movement mechanics feels a lot like the older games (pre-AC unity) so it feels fast but sometimes unresponsive. It's quite frustrating when Evie/Jacob doesn't move the way you intend them to.

If you really like the Assassin's Creed franchise, do get this, especially if it's on sale. If not, it's worth skipping this, I think Ubisoft needs to take time to properly improve the series.

The storyline is comprehensible, the characters are three dimensional and memorable, combat returns to a simpler but more fluid and visually entertaining design, and above all else Syndicate manages to properly balance its amount of side missions, collectibles, and weapons/gear. Additionally, Ubisoft learned from its mistakes in Unity by NOT trying to force us into co-op missions or obtaining a smartphone/tablet application in order to get the full experience.\nHowever, Syndicate does show us that Ubi is still having some issues getting its modern day storyline/characters off the ground post-Desmond era. Things were much more straight forward and interesting when it was just Desmond and friends trying to prevent the end of the world in 2012. Now, the modern day plot has just become so bogged down with Sages, Abstergo entertainment fronts, the Initiates, and Juno having free reign of the digital world (and of coarse what they've now added in Syndicate involving the Shroud and the Precursor race). While players may have complained about poor ol' Desmond during his time I think it's safe to say we miss him and are in dire need of a new modern protagonist.\nFinally, it does appear that a portion of the player base continues to have technical problems on the same scale as with Unity. Personally I have not experieced any of these issues outside of the Jack the Ripper DLC which crashed quite often and glitched out with things like throwing carriages across the map. If you're looking at purchasing this game I would go ahead and try and figure out what kind of setups those experiencing issues have to avoid any possible disappointments.\nAll in all, I would certainly say that if you lost faith in the series after Unity you'll want to give Syndicate a spin - it may very well restore your faith in Assassin's Creed.\n8 top hats out of 10", "hours": 96.3, "user_id": "76561198006893472", "username": "Fear2288", "products": 418, "early_access": false}

The story was unfocused, Arno had very little character development and just felt like an Ezio copy.  The gameplay was changed for the worse, I only remember 3 characters (including the main playable) and it was too crowded.\nSyndicate feels like a true AC game, better than the Ezio trilogy.  The best part is having two characters makes for more to go off of for them.  Jacob is a fighter & takes the most action, but his weakness is that he causes the most chaos.  Evie is the stealth character that is much smarter & applies critical thinking to situations, but at times doesn't take enough action to help out.  Having the character flaws isn't bad, they both make up for it with a yin/yang mix as twins.\nThe villains this time are FAR more memorable.  Each character got so much more development and much better blue screen deaths than in the past.  Having each character's role outlined (ie: the banker, the scientist, the doctor, the transporter, etc) makes their missions, motives, character traits far more memorable.\nThe actual assassination missions were the best.  Not since AC1 have I looked forward to actual Templar assassinations, but that was because AC1 had \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 gameplay elsewhere other than the assassinations.\nThe music is incredible, by far the best since AC2 & Brotherhood's soundtrack but actually I'd say even better.\n-At the beginning, the Mentor named George lectures the twins about staying away from London.  They disobey him and he's never heard from again.  I was expecting him to show up in sequence 4 or 5 with his monacle broken & jowels flapping.  I was disappointed.\n-The main villain, Crawford Starrick, is a really good presence & very well acted.  However, literally every scene but the final sequence has him in his office assigning other people to do dirty work.  He never does\nactual fieldwork or has any interaction with them face to face.  Granted, you can say \"Well, London was completely under his control so he didn't need to leave his office\", but tha'ts weak.\n-The sidequests have very little payoff.  I only did them for fun.  Hell, I cleared out a huge chunk of chests & collectibles for fun, but that was just me enjoying the game.  There really is no actual payoff to it unless if I was achievement hunting, which I'm not on Ubiplay garbage.\nAnyway, great game, worth the $20 I spent it on.

I completed game with 93% synchronization.\nGood Things:\n+few new things like wrope attachment to hidden blade. easier way to get to roof.\n+carriages. Grand Thief Carriages.  You can hijack carrages drive trought London like crazy. You can throw darts to other carriage horses, so they become wildy. [kinda fun]\n+Graphics are real good better than unity.\n+Many Different types of Enemy and Ally units.\n+Eagle Vision is better [too good]\n+I like Trains. yes i actually like assassins base on train. That is good idea.\n+ Volt Granades is good thingy\n+Story lane it self is pretty good. ww1 mission is the best of all\n+End Fight is AWESOME!\nNow bad Things:\n- 1st I hate the most. Free Run SAFETY! WHY! UBISOFT WHY! Why need something like that?! I you need to follow someone or quickly escame, or you want quickly cross thames. All the time Jacob/Evie stops at stops at the edge. Then Shows sign on screen  [shift+w+e] i pressed once, twice! nothing at third time they dicide to jump water or if you on roof they jump whatever they like.\n-Climbing to walls is not challenge anymore. If we go back to Eczio games AC2 part2 where Rosa Teach Eczio how to jump up to walls wihile climbing. [Here the\n] Then in Syndicate you can jump up to wall most inpossible heights. That make game too easy, and not realistic. And when you get wrope attachmet, just jump from one building to anothet like spiderman.\n-Targeting. I like wrope gun, but to shoot wrope need to point spot where you want shoot wrope. So i sit on building in front of me is Helix fragment. I want to get it.  I have to shoot wrope to other building to collect it. Sounds Easy.But when you try to point wrope to place you need. 60% times he/she shoot it else where. ok here another example. when you chasing Carriage and you all you need is quickly pull urself to front building roof. I pull camera up a little, and pressed R to shoot wrope, but she/he shoot wrope to other building who is behind somewhere, plus you cant to detach so quickly. So badguys escaped and mission failed.\n-combating is boring and annoying. If you remember old Conor days AC3 or Black Flag, how you can steal enemy weapons or pick them up from dead body. NOW YOU CAN'T YaaaaaaaY! In combat you can't: throw sand or dirt in oponent face, you can't taunt, you can't, steal their weapons, you can't hang them, you can't do multikils more than 3 guys, can't use guys as meat shield, you can't block [ at least i don't know how]. Now What you can: you can punch them face, you can stab them, you can quickly finish them using F key, you can dodge from bullets using F key,and  you can breeak blocks [logically]. some fights 1v1 may take more than 5-8min with random bad guy on street.\n- You can't jump on place. if Helix fragment is right above ur head and you need only jump a little tiny bit, to collect it. but you can't...\n-Crowd event thieves: same as Unity thieves are bad at escaping. In unity they was averige age man who steals wallet and slowly clumsy try to run away. In syndicate they are changed. In place of average man they are old womans, who steals purse, and same way clumsy try to escape. But  then mighty Assasin Jacobs do the body slam on that old woman to the ground and take back stolen stuff.\n-and there still is some bugs. like looting same chest 2x. After saving women on street from criminals she suddenly turns in big strong baldhead, who still talks in womens voice. Or killed person but he stand up and start to walk away foward. Once was raining man from clear sky, they fall and died. and other little bugs...\n-Maybe I'm wrong, but there is a waaaaaaay mutch english humor. Each cut scene Jacob and Evie insulting each other with cheep jokes. This made me skip many cutscenes.\n-still pay to quick boost your hero, still pay to get in game cash. You can pay real money to get healix cash and get better stuff in fast way...\n-and i don't get it Why need somekind skill trees... WHY! old Assassin creeds was so good without somekind skill trees. The best was old fashon way. Get stuff and new skills when you get further in campaign missions.\nFinal Summation:\n*If you are fan of all Assassin games have played all of them. Then you will be happy to know Syndicate is better than unity, but still one of worst assassin games.\n\n*But If you are new to assassin games then go and try this game it is not bad for those who don't realy know all story lane.\nMy own game rating is 6/10stars it is playable but not good enought. Definitely not worth 59.99$ That is a BIG NO.  19$- 21$ maybe but Not 59,99$.", "hours": 53.4, "username": "President Of Evil Arts", "products": 604, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

ACS is the story of a brother and sister assassin couple who you get to switch between to play the story, which is an interesting way to play a storyline and, personally, I liked it a lot. This is the second AC series game that I've played(the first being Black Flag) and although I may not be the most die-hard fan like some others, I can definately see how the AC series has a certain feel and groove to it, and ACS most certainly fits that groove in new and interesting ways. You're able to hijack trains, carriages, free children from factories, and steal cargo from ships which are all great additions to the gameplay of AC. The map itself is absolutely beautiful, the details are all perfect and it really feels like being in victorian London. At times, I felt that the main story was not very interesting and fell into a dull pattern of assassinating characters and I felt that Ubisoft could've made the storyline much more fascinating, and conquering boroughs is incredibly repetitive and takes so much time. Eventhough the main story is a bit dull, I felt that the side missions made up for it - meeting historical characters like Alexander Grambell, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin and fulfilling missions for them was very fun. Even if the main story was dull, the assassination missions themselves were extremely fun, because you are able to pick your path to assassination of the caracter instead of having it already layed out for you. All in all, ACS is a worthy addition to the AC franchise and is definately worth the money for a fun game to play (especially if you get it for cheap on a steam sale). The AC franchise is on the right track with this game, and with only a few changes, I feel the next game will be greatly improved.", "hours": 42.3, "username": "nattov", "products": 33, "early_access": false}

Some of the new mechanics in Syndicate are very interesting and quite fun to mess around with, the zipline in particular. While it does make scaling buildings and getting across rooftops too easy sometimes, in such a large world it is a useful tool nontheless. Syndicate has a larger focus on hand to hand combat than previous installments and I enjoyed this very much. It's a lot more satisfying for me to be able to beat your enemies down with your fists rather than just whipping out a big sword and slicing your enemies like soft butter. Having said that, I did quite enjoy the kukri as a weapon as well. Stealth and parkour mechanics have been improved on since the last installment of Unity, which to be honest I quite enjoyed after the majority of the bugs were fixed. I did enjoy the fact that you could switch between Jacob and Evie, instead of being limited to just one protagonist.

It is almost impossible to walk five metres without going \"Oohh what is that there!\" The only real downside i have is that the game is demanding on hardware, but the graphics appear to mostly justify the performance.\nOverall, a good game to buy if you stopped playing Assassin's Creed but feel like coming back to the series or want to give the series a go if you have not played it before.", "hours": 21.4, "username": "Matthew", "products": 122, "early_access": false}

I played on highest graphics settings with no hiccups but I was playing with 2 GTX 970 graphics cards. I did notice that in cut scenes often times sounds or voices did not sync up with graphics.\nThe gameplay itself is very similar to all other Assassin's Creeds, with the added bonus of having a character solely meant to beat people to a pulp. I did love Jacob's character because you could take a break from Evie's infiltration and silence to ruthlessly beat down baddies to your heart's content. While this may not be the most effective way to play the game, the option is there it makes the battling so much more enjoyable.\nThe game itself is significantly less cluttered than other AC games. It does have the collectibles that all the games have, but the sidequests don't become too much of a task to complete and scale well with the leveling system. The main story progresses rapidly in comparison to the other AC games but I didn't mind this as much as I do with games like Far Cry.\nAll in all it is a good game worth getting.

The game is very entertaining for the most part, but can get to the point where it starts to drag on in the end. You gain experience through out playing the game that allow you to increase your combat skill, add additional perks to each character and unlock new items to use upon reaching new levels and completing sequences. You also have to look for items throughout London to upgrade you gang by giving them better weapons, horse carriages to drive around the city, and just making the stronger in general. The game includes a lot of the fighting style and combat mechanics as Unity and a few from Rogue.\nAesthetics, the game looks... well... decent. I'm not able to run it on the highest of settings but I can run it decently and it looks okay. I think they could have done a way better job on how this game looks even though it's during the \"steampunk\" era. Like Black Flag that game was absolutely gorgeous, this game is honestly kind of a let down to me personally when it comes to graphics but it still looks amazing and is fun to play.\nAll in all or TL;DR:\nThis game is fun and has a lot of exciting moments in and brings a whole new feel to the Assassins Creed Franchise in my opinion kind of like how Black Flag and Brotherhood change the series as a whole. I would recommend this game to anyone who is just looking for a really fun game to play that might take them around 40 - 50 hours to complete in total. I rate this game a solid 8.5/10 overall gaming aspects but for an Assassins Creed game it gets 9/10 from me. Nothing will ever be better than Black FLag and Brotherhood to me.

I really like the setting of Victorian London and Ubisoft didn't disapoint.They always do a fantastic job at detailing the world while also teaching you a bit about historical characters and events. The gameplay is also more along the lines of 2, were you have to take strong holds aroudn the map in order to unlock items/money.\nJacob and Evie are likeable enough (still no match for Ezio) and I enjoyed their story line. Although I still don't care for the modern junk they put in every game, it's just an annoying side part of the game in my eyes, I'd rather AC series didn't have it at all. Luckily the main quest did not have much of it, unlike some of the privous outings that overdid it (AC4)\nOne thing that really\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665me off was the horse racing (and any time you had to run from AI which is quite alot) and the rubber band effect. If you've played any racing games, you know what I'm talking about. In Syndicate, there is no outrunning the AI, they are faster then you and they can aim very well and shot you from behind where you can't get them. Very frustrating.\nEvie also becomes super strong late game with her invisability cloak plus throwing knife upgrades making missions a walk in the park. Just throw a knife to the head and enemies are instantly dead (even level 10) all from being invisible. Not that it's that hard with Jacob either but at least you have to put some effort in sneaking and positioning.\nFinally the final boss fight + ending is super lame. It's like Ubisoft rushed the final 10-15 mins or so of the game. Anyway if you like AC this is still quite an ejoyable run. Definately better then AC Unity, though this one like Unity crashed on me every time I took a stronghold and the custscene would finish.

I got into AC recently starting with Black Flag and then the Ezio Trilogy and the movement is flows really well. Some vets may not like it but you use more buttons now for the free running as opposed to Black Flag/Rogue where you use only 1 button to free run. This uses 2 for the free running whether you want to go up or down so you should have more control on your movement. The story is not the greatest since it's relatively safe so it's not the greatest story in the world but it makes up for it with some of my favorite main chartacters in an AC since Edward Kenway and Ezio Auditore. Jacob and Evie Frye are an awesome brother and sister duo with Jacob being the less serious brother who prefers loud and proud and building up a gang and Evie being more serious with the Assassin and Templar business and prefers being stealthy and healthy. Jacob and Evie are incredibly likable and the 2 together in cutscenes I always have a chuckle with Jacob's sarcasm and not giving a crap about Templar stuff and Evie trying to be serious and get him to get it together. This is a very light hearted AC not as serious as previous titles so I like the change in direction the story takes. Not to mention. London looks beautiful in this game,  The PC Version runs really good on my PC as well, so it's very well optimized.

Jacob and Evie's different personality and play style offers so much more experience than previous games. The parkour was somewhat the same as unity, although this time they added the grappling hook (not to be confused with the hook blade of course) for easier navagation, since in the late 1800s, roads are wider. At first I thought that would just killed the entire parkour experience AC fans loved so much about, and even though i understand why the grappling gun was neccessary and that it's just a game, I still find it weird at times how this physics defying tool can exist in victorian london. But trust me, without it you will be miserable in this game. I just think the game developers can come up with a more realistic/ better navagating tool for that period, or at least limit the features like gliding upwards with your hand.\nThe covering system/ stealth mode is quite nice, although since they got rid of the \"enter cover\" button i sometimes am not sure if i am in cover or not, but trust me, it does not affect your stealth play one bit, in fact it's an improvement. And one of the things i like about this newly installed AC game is the enter stealth mode feature. Wearing a hood all the time makes you look more suspicious doesn't it? especially in an era where its not a fashion trend. So they added the feature where jacob and evie will only put on their hood when you're entering stealth mode, jolly good!\nIssues with the game:\nI'm playing this game on my MSI GS60 gaming laptop, i got a intel core i7 6700 HQ cpu and an Nvidia GTX970m with 16 gs of vram. I thought this is more than enough to play the game, but I encountered some problems when launching the game.\nIssue 1: Full screen/ windowed problem.\nMy screen supports 4K, but as you gamers know playing on 4K requires much more than what I have, so when turn the resolution down to 1080p, the game wont let me enter full screen, to fix this simply click on the diplay option and select \"borderless fullscreen\"\nIssue 2: Frame rate drop\nNow i know this is a graphic demanding game, but come on I got a GTX970m.... sigh oh well i will admit gaming on a laptop, you win some you lose some. But to fix this issue just turn off ambient occlusion, you really cant tell much of the difference, and set your anti aliasing to FXAA. Overall, depending on your gaming rig, if you are like me, or close to mine, set your graphic preset to high instead of ultra, gaming on ultra for this game you probably need a better gaming rig than what i have.\nIssue 3: ACS auto select GPU as integrated GPU\nSo like i said I got a GTX 970m, but my integrated GPU is of course \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ier, a intel HD 5000 or something like that. After I install the new Driver from GeExperience for my GPU, ACS suddenly uses my integrated GPU. son of a ..... anyways, to fix this, just find nvidia control panel on your computer, select manage 3dD settings, program settings, and then select ACS as the program you want to customize, and then underneath it select your prefer graphic processor as \"high performance nvidia processor\". It worked for me. Also like to point out all my other games like Fallout 4, ACU, Far cry 4 have no issue with this, so maybe its something to do with the game. I have no idea.\nIssue 4: Game crashes/ stopped working after a while....\nAll i can say for this, is to play the game as admin, locate your game in your steamapps file, right click on ACS icon, play as admin, ever since i did that, no crashes for 2 hours of gameplay. so..... yay....i guess....", "hours": 174.7, "user_id": "76561198284532453", "username": "leroycchsu", "products": 36, "early_access": false}

I just really like killing people in several different ways. But anyways I believe combat is now perfected, unity came close but this system is very fun and makes sense and a challenge and now with the ability to do multi kills all the way up to a quad kill also gives me an even more fun side challenge, the animations even match up unlike unity, and people with guns seem to take in consideration who is around before they start shooting up the place. one annoying thing tho it doesn't happen often a dead enemy that has not fallen just yet will pretty much be a brick wall and even stop me from attacking or countering by standing between you and other enemies. I wish I could just shove them to the ground or something like using them as a meat shield in the counter, and also npc's seem to have allot more poise and don't seem to get pushed out the way as easy as before unless of course you are running them over with a wagon. and oh yeah npc's have real conversations now instead of random crowd noise so that's pretty cool, some of them don't match entirely like a woman arguing with a man that was serenading her, but that was funny lol.

For most of the game, they're basically interchangeable to play: save for a few high-level abilities they have identical skill trees. Only near the end of the game do they really begin to feel distinct. Jacob is more of a brawler, Evie more focused on stealth, and crafting or unlocking gear like sneakier outfits or deadlier weapons can complement their respective toolkits.

And running over the roofs (a signature feature for AC) is nearly impossible, because there are so many steps, chimneys and other stuff.\nSumming this up, this is the most boring AC ever in my opinion.

Ok, I admit that I was never \"out of love\" with the series at all, but there were definitely some games in the franchise that were way better than others. I tend to see the positives, much more than the negatives, unless those negatives far overshadow the others.\nAnd with Syndicate, that's just not the case. Likeable player characters, likeable NPCs finally, as well as a decent story make this one of my favorites since the AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations trio that I judge all AC games against. Yeah, I thought those were the best 3, but I still like the rest of the franchise as well. Even Unity, which I got well after all the dust had settled and was able to play pretty much trouble-free except for some minor inconsequential issues.\nSyndicate makes me love the series again, though, like I did back when the best ones came out. Even though Syndicate has dumbed down a lot of the combat, it's still fun and exciting to undertake, rather than dread it, and even the finishing moves are kinda cool, although a tad repetitious after awhile.\nIt's a fun game, feels like Assassin's Creed again, and I just love the history and ambiance that I can just immerse myself into. I love reading all the history, and like AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, I'm intrigued enough to start researching into the history on my own to read more about it.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 165, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-02-24", "text": "Recommended. Everything in this game is much simpler than previous assassin's creed titles, for better or worse. Well, everything except combat, that is. This is an uncharacteristically awesome port, a rather nice game on its own, and a great addition to what is frankly becoming a stale and dying franchise. If you've got money to blow, go for it.\nAssassin's Creed Unity is a refreshing title. For better or worse, it strays far from the \"tried and true\" Assassin's Creed formulae in basically every conceivable way. Everything from parkour to navigation, stealth to combat, assassinations to spreading influence across the city to just wasting time with side activities--hell, even the story is far away from what we're used to.\nYou actually have a sneak button in this game. While sneaking, you're harder to see, get detected much slower, and move slightly faster. Additionally however, you can't blend into crowds like you could if you were standing up. You also have a few new tricks in your aresenal... You can now sneak up on people to knock them out as opposed to killing them, and you can kidnap them, in order to use them as meatshields and to avoid detection, and you can now whistle at guards to lure them to your current location. The stealth system is otherwise more or less unchanged; the AI is still\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and most of your stealth missions still boil down to infiltrating location X and killing Templar Y. Not sure what else you'd expect from a game called \"ASSASSIN'S CREED\" though, in all honesty.\nThe game also features a different combat system, as well. Like in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, there are now a whole host of different weapon types--the difference is however, this time around you'll actually have a reason to use them! Your weapon choices include kukris, brass knuckles, and sword canes. Brass knuckles have a lot of stunning power, and keep enemies off of you for longer, kukris kill enemies much quicker than the other weapon types, and sword canes are more or less somewhere in the middle. Unlike previous games, you can no longer switch to just fighting with your bare hands or with your hidden blade in the middle of battle. Instead, your hidden blade only peeks out when the next killmove decides it should. You can also chain your other weapons into your combos more easily now. It feels like they tried to emulate the Arkham games' freeflow combat system... With \"meh\" results.\nBy far the most drastic change is the parkour system. Parkour boils down to three buttons now: The \"Free Run\" mode button, which you hold down to start free running, and then two buttons to either attempt to run up to HIGHER terrain or drop down to LOWER terrain. Just holding down the free run button will cause your character to try to run on an even plane. It feels much simpler than previous games... I'm not a fan of it, but it works MUCH more reliably than previous games, I have to give it that much. It's much more difficult to accidentally run off of a building, or go up a chimney you were trying to run around, or run face-first into a wall you want to climb...\nAnother big change to the parkour system is the addition of the rope launcher. Once again, it feels like they were trying to emulate the Arkham games, with \"meh\" results. The rope launcher allows you to grapple up onto ledges from the ground without having to climb up the wall, and it also allows you to create ziplines between ledges, which you can drop off of to assassinate guards and goons. It's a rather temperamental little contraption however, and it can be excessively difficult to get the damn thing to shoot at the ledge you actually want to go to. Thankfully however, it's something you can get through most of the game without even using. It'll save you time, but you can usually climb without it, not withstanding some rather tall vantage points and other cliffs.\nThe storymode is also very different. We actually have likeable protagonists! Not just one, but TWO! Yes! TWO characters! AND there are MUCH fewer missions with instant failure states. It's like getting a cupcake, AND getting a cherry on top. The game also focuses much more on the \"memory exploration\" side of things and less on the \"real world\" side of things. You now only get a couple 2 or 3 minute cutscenes between memory sequences every now and then, chronicling the activities of the Brotherhood in the outside world.\nBack on the two character thing... You actually get to play as both Jacob AND Evie Frye, twin assassins. You can freely switch between the two of them, and each has their own preferences. Jacob prefers to charge into the situation and murder everything that twitches, while Evie prefers the \"Classic\" subtle approach. Each character also has a few missions exlusive to them. Despite their specializations, they're still both able to beat the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of people and sneak around effectively, so they're both worth playing, regardless of your preferences. They're also both really likeable characters, so that's a bonus.\nIn conclusion... The game is good. The PC port is great. UPlay integration won't make you want to rip your balls off this time around. If you need a new stealth game, or you need to renew your faith in the franchise, this is worth picking up.", "hours": 52.7, "user_id": "76561198051136047", "username": "Ol' Uncle Sheo[Gurren]", "products": 171, "early_access": false}

That totally takes away from the experience. Not to mention how glitchy some scenes were.\nThe new open world and multi-prong approach is interesting and I love the new stealth options but some elements of smooth combat seemed missing. Combat feels rather disjointed (most of the time you seem to be able to handle only one dude at a time unlike the multiple assassination combat in ACII-IV).\nThe most disappointing part was actually the plot which was neither engaging nor satisfying :( you don't actually feel like you want to find out more and I find myself playing just to complete the game. Most of the time plot points don't link up very well and overall it just felt like you are completing mini-tasks instead of an overall plot.\nOverall ACS should still be better than ACU but still a stretch even from ACIII and Black Flag.

Gentle blend of brawling and the league of extraordinary gentlemen). The setting itself is fun and interesting, but it is not alive.

Meet our designer of controls.\n- Story is not immersive, it falls short and it has nothing to do with anything, the last time Ubisoft delivered something new and fresh was 2004. The story is like watching the Kardashians after DMT.\n- You can actually purchase in-game boosters for single player game.\n- Did I mention the controls?\n- The in-game crafting system and upgrading yourself as you go is like playing Farmville on Facebook.

Not only is this game an insult to the senses in every way imaginable, the gameplay, the story, the recycled characters most notably Jacob Fry who is just a mix of Edward Kenway and that guy from Watchdogs no one remembers. The creators with Ubisoft at the helm have seemingly grown tired of anything that resembles quality or joy in their products and rather is scarily close to turning into Stalin of the game world, a position currently inhabited by their self-proclaimed enemy and biggest competitor - EA. They\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665all over their users with the most notable example with Unity in which they released an unfinished product at full price, and only offering compensation several months later after a massive backlash extremely rarely seen among consumers, but forcing customers wishing to accept the peace offering that they could not anytime in the future sue Ubisoft over Unity.\nAnd with this stinking pile of garbage they have not only put together a cliche-filled, gameplay-broken, lazy approach to gaming by taking the standard template they seem to just be recycling for every annual game, but they have more importantly completely \"forgot\" to optimise it after release since it after all was a much better release than Unity in that it was actually playable upon release. UBISOFT - this has been said way too many times already that it borders on customer service clich\u00e9, but I have a sincere hope that there is still some good people left at your companies who believe the magic and beauty in beautifully crafted games. That games are not only a way to pass the time and shoot some bad guys, but that can enlighten and broaden ones minds and transport oneself to a different world, a different time. I must believe that is what the creators of AC 2 were embodying when they created what is, in my opinion not only the finest AC game to be released, but one of the best sci-fi games of this generation. You got everything right: the location, the story, the gameplay, the sidemissions, the graphics, the music - and most importantly, you respected your audience in delivering something to be proud of, and something you felt your audience deserved. For those responsible for that piece of art - I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nAnd to those who have become mindless robots churning out what has - UNFORTUNATELY - become a yearly tradition of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 all over audiences, I will never forget, but I still have hope you will redeem yourself before this franchise finally runs out of steam. Finally, I just want direct my attention to the head of Ubisoft - Yvet Guillemot (or how its spelled). You sir are responsible for what have befallen this beloved and excellent franchise, and you will ultimately have to answer to all those fans you have dissapointed time and again, and who miracelously come back for more every single year, myself being one of them, because they still have hope that the franchise might one day be great again.

It feels like it has auto pilot on half the time, they never go where I actually want them to go, and they always jump in the wrong direction. And The Wall Eject is crap now, you actually need something they can grab on to behind them for it to work, so if you want to jump off a wall onto the ground it won't do it.\nSecondly, Combat..... Oh the horrible combat... They are supposed to be trained Assassin's, so why doesn't a counter kill or at least do more damage. If you have to attack an enemy 12+ times just to kill them with your Kukuri/Crane Sword, then why do you call yourself an Assassin, that's a disgrace to AC, AC2, Brotherhood and Revelations. Hell, even AC3 and AC4 had good combat. What happened Ubisoft?\nThird, movement. No more fast walk, why? It could have improved the stealth aspect a lot, instead of needing to run at a target to get to them faster. I don't remember when they took away the option to gently push citizens aside to walk past them, now it's just a bump into them sending them stumbling, how very Assassin like, why not draw more attention to yourself?\nFourth and Finally, the zipline. Incredibly handy, best tool they introduced. However, at least Ezio had a hook to protect his hand. And the fact that you can slide UP the zipline at that speed is ridiculous, at least make them put one hand infront of the other and slowly go up.\nThey have made massive improvements to the Assassin's Creed series, and I really enjoy the story and how detailed the game is. it's beautiful on max settings, and the voice acting is great. But they really \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed the \"Assassin\" aspect of the game up. Sure Evie acts like the assassin's should, but I'm plain disappointed in how the Combat, Movement, and feel of the controls have changed. If they were more responsive and climbed in the direction I aimed instead of their own path that would be tremendous. I realize that I did complain about the combat, and that assassin's are meant to be quite and stealth kill, but the gang fights kill that, and when you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up and get caught by the enemies you have no choice to fight, so, why wouldn't they be trained to kill faster? Why do they take so long to put the blade in the enemies throat, heart, face, or tear open a massive wound with a blade in their stomach? I just don't understand what Ubisoft was thinking.\nAll in all, I enjoy the game to a fine point, after that, it's a world of disappointment.\nDo I recommend this game?\nYes and No. I will put Yes, but it's boarderline No.", "hours": 21.7, "user_id": "76561198009171124", "username": "Brynjar", "products": 65, "early_access": false}

One simply has a few more combat skills and the other has a few more stealth skills. both of which are a moot point as both combat and stealth are more simple and straightforward than ever before.\nThat being said gameplay can get pretty stale after a while, though the game leaves lots of room for you're engagement method of choice. You can be a quiet as a snake or as loud as a bull in a china shop and get the job done just the same aside from only a hand ful of random missions that strong arm you (in the most clumsy of fashions) into doing it their way.\nThe tools shine here in this game better than they have in a long time. the last time i had as much fun with the various gadgets avalible was back in brotherhood.

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 172, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-02-03", "text": "Assassins Creed Syndicate is the very first modern Assassins Creed ever created. When you think London in the middle of 1868, London is in the middle industrial revolution and it is only 75 years away from French revolution. However it feels like a thousand years has passed, because it completely changes people how they live.\nIntroducing two main protagonists, Jacob and Evie, they will fight back free up London using their street gangs. Jacob and Evie have to gather people to take down the Templars.\nI won\u2019t spoil the story but I can tell you that you\u2019ll learn many of historical stories which are a lot more interesting than your school.  Starring Charles Darwin, Karl Max, Alexander Graham bell, Queen Victoria and many more Syndicate manages to deliver a cohesive and satisfying tale.\nThe gameplay has been polished a lot, seems like the developer has learned a lot from the previous series.\nIn Syndicate, developers also revamp the combat system. Back then, London, in 1868, is the time of concealed weapon. Back in the time, 70 years before was Medieval time period. Weapon was to have a sword, axe, and etc. But now in London 1868, London is not possible to do that. Therefore the combat is more to street combat style where everything has been brought into close quarters. Syndicate focuses on melee combat, with Jacob and his street gang pulling enemies into fist fights on the city streets. Combat is no less brutal than in previous games, but bringing fights between you and your enemies closer allows for some seriously cool-looking cinematic kills. They are faster and more brutal than ever. Thanks to weapons like the brass knuckles.\nCountering, Chain kills, Double kills, Enemy shields, Disarming, Hiring, Cinematic kills, Weapon toss, Variety of projectiles, and etc have been brought back. But, combat using the hidden blade like in Assassin Creed 2 or brotherhood has not been brought back. It\u2019s only being used for the finishing move.\n\nLondon buildings are taller and wider than any features in the series before.  Syndicate introduces the rope launcher (a tool that probably the game changer of the game), which lets Jacob and Evie rapidly ascend to high ledges and create ziplines across wide gaps to help them quickly get around these larger spaces. Player can use it almost in any building that they want.\nThe way how you switch your character is just like GTA V, you can freely switch whenever you want from the Menu. You are in open world; it is your choice to play whether you want to play as Jacob or Evie. However, within the main sequences/chapters, whichever you want to refer to, this world will alternate between the two depending on the story what you want to tell. In addition, what make it more fun is the perks/upgrades is different within each other.\n\nWhistling is also back, is just as useful as ever, as we found when we used it to lure a gang member to our hiding spot for a quick, clean kill from cover.\nThe Hood toggle works beautifully. While you are in the stealth mode you will always have your hood on. When you are walk freely or not in the stealth mode, you can have your hood away.\n\nThis is the big part of Syndicate. Thinking of London in 1868, London has \u201cThe Carriage\u201d. The player can steal the vehicle and even hijack it. Player also can ride on it; hide in it and even fight on the top. The carriage is a powerful tool for the player to navigate freely. But be aware that enemy can also use it to against you.\n\nJust almost like in Brotherhood series where you can hire your Assassins brotherhood. Instead of that, in Syndicate you can hire your gang to fight with you.\nAs you explore the magnificence of London city in the 19 Century, it makes you want to pack up your stuffs immediately and fly to London. Sky-high towers, stone walkways line the financial center, galloping horse carriage, red-box telephone, homeless burn fires in trash cans in alleys, stations bustle with passengers and passing trains, London feels alive. It\u2019s breath-taking.\nThe character design is really sharp. Looking at the white silky smooth beard of Charles Darwin in the highly detailed graphic makes you want to try to pull his beard or burn it.\nThe lighting in this game is absolutely amazing. Everything looks believable, they are using HDR effect to slowly blend in the darker place to the brighter place; you can see from indoor to outdoor, the outdoor is very bright. As you are going out, the brightness will slowly blend in to normal brightness. In other hand, from brighter place to darker place, you can from outdoor to indoor; the room started with very dark lighting and slowly blends in to normal brightness. Honestly, this is one of best looking open-world; everything looks amazing, the buildings, the shadow, the texture, the detail, are astounding.\nTalking about music, because in Assassins Creed 3 the music was almost dead all the time. In Syndicate, as player move throughout the city, you will hear different ambient music. For instance, in the street you could hear people playing violin, or, if you are in the pop music place, you could hear pop music. It is really nice to have this idea in the game because it reflexes different feeling where you are in. Thanks to Austin Wintory, a great grammy-nominated Journey composer for creating awesome music background for Syndicate. You are not far from Jesper Kyd.\nBoth the story missions and the open-world activities work better than previous series. It isn\u2019t perfect, but with such a beautiful city, a genuinely likeable cast of characters, and many improvements to both stealth and combat this feels like a step in the right direction for Assassin\u2019s Creed. You can stick with this game for hundreds of hours to finish it on 100% sync memories.\n1.\tSome random crash and freeze screen sometimes happens.\n2.\tTo running on 60 fps with everything on maximum setting, you really need strong pc specs.

I do need to note that I did skip Unity (I played Rogue instead) and there might be issues/positives which I dislike/like that are present in Unity.\nPROS:\n+This is the most Assassin's Creed game to date. It's a sandbox and there's stuff to do in it. It reminds me a lot of Brotherhood, but with more in it.\n+Combat has clutter cut out and looks brilliant as ever.\n+Graphics are good. It looks like London.\n+The new \"zip-line\" gadget which channels Batman is a welcome addition. I'm guessing somebody at Ubisoft really wanted the Hooksword to come back and meant halfway with this.\n+The banter between Jacob and Evie is good. They share lines of dialog which resemble actual brother and sister conversations.\n+For the majority of the game you can play as either Jacob or Evie without having to change, but, as you'll see below, this is a con when examined below the surface.\nMIXED:\n+/- All the historical figures in Syndicate were shoved in at the last minute. I am most certainly not the first to point this out, but it's so obvious and must be pointed out more. They all have thier moments, very bizarrely timed moments (except for the one from WWI and Karl Marx, who can best be described with a neon sign above their heads), but none have a central role to the story, such as Leonardo Da Vinci did in previous games. In an uncanny cycle, each historical figure shows up and knows Jacob and Evie, which is weird the first time and dreadfully unnerving for the rest since they are supposed to be a part of a secret order of assassins. It sucks because many of them can be outright cut out of the game and be replaced with just ONE of them. Like Leonardo, that single figure could be a mentor/friend to the assassins twins.\n+/- Also, every single other character in the game other than Jacob and Evie feel tacted on. Yes, I mean EVERY other character. They are simply there to fill a reputation grind role. Oh, and if it wasn't for one good line of dialog between Ned (the transgender character) and Jacob, Ned would have been the most token character of the bunch; yet, if there was going to be a token character, it'd actually be Karl Marx, who's contribution to the game and plot are far less. It's funny because all of these characters have unique voice actors and some artist put their work into making them all look different, but, again, like the historical figures, each character has a moment here and there and each can be replaced by just one.\n+/- There aren't enough side missions when conquering London. Sure, there are enough to make it fun, but I feel like there should have been more considering there's a scene set in... Well look below, it might be a spoiler, but it won't be if you actually think about it.\nCONS:\n-No co-op. You'll understand why this is a major issue because....\n-....the difference between playing Jacob and Evie is almost nill. Both have 3 perks which are exclusive to that character and, as I discovered when unlocking them, the only good ones are with Jacob because they relate directly to combat. Evie's relate to stealth, yet stealth has never been difficult or important in Assassin's Creed, which is a tad ironic if you think about it.\n-There are collision bugs here and there. Within the first 10 minutes of playing, I managed to accidental get Jacob stuck in the ground.\n-The chases in this game are utter garbage and poorly designed. Tell me if this sounds logical: A child below the age of 10, a woman w/ heels who was hypnotized, and a man who did not have a head start can OUTRUN Jacob for several minutes. It doesn't.\n-Ubisoft, please... STOP IT WITH THE FRIGGIN' FUTURE STORY! I do not care for those two idiots who helped Desmond and Lucy. They aren't well written. They aren't important. They aren't fun. THEY ARE BLOODY USELESS! I thought the future plot in Rogue was bad, but Syndicate takes the cake because it really, REALLY feels stitched on to an otherwise okay plot set in London.\n-Okay, this might be a little spoiler. You have been warned. Anyway, at one point you see a tear in the simulation (damn you real world!) that leads to a future setting: World War I. Sounds good, right? It isn't, because it's SOLE purpose is to, you guessed it, tie in MORE future stuff. Remember that woman from AC3? Juno was her name, and she's now some machine spirit in the internet. She shows up, explains what she's done (aka stuff you already know and don't care about) and you kill the Sage from AC 4: Black Flag again. That's it. There's no purpose for going to World War I other than getting more terrible exposition you already know from a character nobody cares about.\nIn conclusion, the majority of issues that I personally had with this game can be summed up as: Ubisoft, stop it with the future\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665because nobody likes it.", "hours": 30.4, "username": "Zeke", "products": 430, "early_access": false}

I always used to wonder if I just spoiled previous games in the series for myself as once you were adept at the combat you could just ignore most of the sneaking around and just butcher everyone you come across.\nBut I've found myself playing more and more as Evie, sneaking around, enjoying it.\nThe skills are effective and the perks are an added bonus.\nThe combat mechanics are a little simplistic, counter strikes are ridiculously easy to do.

Loads of side quests, things to explore, likeable characters, ok story. Still haven't played the game through since I have been doing so much other stuff than main story. Of course the game can get repetitive and boring from time to time but honestly that happens in every single game did you admit it or not.\nThen I should talk about the combat. Combat is different, again, but this time it is a bit harder and requires practice. Since there is the leveling system ,which I am going to talk about next, the lvl 9 mobs are so hard when you are lvl 2 or 3 that you want to stay away from their vision and from the streets in the areas they move.\nOkay, leveling system, yeeey. Seriously this system is actually pretty good, it keeps you playing the game and trying to do all the side missions in order to get more xp to lvl up and use skillpoints and such. But if you do it like me that you are still in the early sequences and just spam side quests, the mission combat is going to get too easy if you get the hang of it. Since you do more dmg so you one-shot low lvl npcs. But other than that, the system is ok and there is no reason to dislike it imo.\nI rate this game 8.5/10 since there is still couple of bugs.

This is the 9th game in the Assassin\u2019s Creed series so far. The game is run using the AnvilNext 2.0 engine, which was used in AC Unity and Rainbow Six Siege.\nFor the game play, most will probably be already well aware of what to expect from an Assassin\u2019s Creed game. You play as one of two playable characters, Evie and Jacob Frye.  A new, welcome mechanic to the game is a rope launcher, allowing the characters to quickly scale larger buildings and to create their own zip-lines for easier travel between buildings too. The combat system is at its best again with a very easy to use control set.  The game is set in London, and you are able to freely roam the city completing all kinds of quests, finding collectables and locating treasure scattered around the world. Whilst the game play is considered the same as the rest of the games, I still really enjoyed it.\nGraphically, Syndicate looks gorgeous, I sadly was not able to run the game at 4k, but was able to push all of the graphics up to max on 1440. The City of London just looks amazing. The textures are of all high quality, animation is almost seemly showing on all of the characters. It is a huge improvement over the previous entries to the series. Voice acting is spot on with the classic London accent on all characters found throughout the game.\nYou should not expect a challenging game when playing Syndicate, as long as you stick to the areas of London that is within your level range, you probably won\u2019t die at all. You can challenge yourself by going to the higher level zones before you should, but I found myself to getting completely overrun by more powerful enemies quicker than normal. The game\u2019s skills trees are very well designed to let you build your two characters to specialise in different trees. I went for Evie being the more stealth oriented character and Jacob the more hand-fisted of the two. I really liked having the option of the two characters as it lets you choose the right head for the job you have been tasked to do.\nLike I said above, the city is jam-packed full of things to do, gang wars, freeing laboured children, finding rare wine or searching for treasure. There are hours of content to be found after you complete the game, with plenty of side quests to take on as well. This was one of the few Assassins\u2019 Creed games that I actually really enjoyed doing the optional tasks in.\nI have been playing Syndicate for about 50 hours so far. The main story only takes about half of that. I wouldn\u2019t say there is a huge level of replay ability in this game, as the story is linear and the lack of any difficulty options means you can\u2019t replay the game in a sort of New Game + mode. Although I am very happy with the amount of hours I have put into the game so far and not many people about the amount of content on offer in this game.\nThankfully I didn\u2019t have any technical problems. I wasn\u2019t able to run at 4k, because it is simply too taxing at this moment in time. But the game ran as smooth as butter at 1440p in 60 fps. The game is very well optimized and loading times are almost none-existent. I played with a controller and I would suggest you do to as the combat system just matches up well with it.\nTo sum up, Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate is one of the better games in the series, coming close to Black Flag as the best.  The characters are probably the most loveable of all of the series so far, with Evie being the first female protagonist. The game has plenty of content, and shows off extremely high production values in the graphics and sound departments. The lack of any technical problems also counts as a major positive for the AC series too given past releases not being so smooth. As with all recently released games in this series, you should expect a premium price tag, and this is no different at \u00a339, 99. If you can wait it out another few months you can probably get it for \u00a330, but I would say the game is even worth it at full price right now.\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Some will say that this was a highlight in the storied gaming series, and it certainly felt entertaining and refreshing for its time. Since playing and completing Brotherhood, I've longed to play another Assassin's Creed game despite varied successes.\nI contemplated purchasing Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, but decided against it purely in opposition to its selling point: its naval exploration and combat focal points. I wanted a return to the exciting combat and incredible settings that Brotherhood (and many subsequent games) have aspired for.\nThat was my first mistake.\nI had also wanted to give Assassin's Creed: Unity a chance... but decided against it due to overwhelmingly negative peer review. Still, the idea of a co-operative Assassin's Creed game is promising.\nI decided that I had waited long enough. I had heard that Assassin's Creed: Syndicate attempts to capture what made Brotherhood so great. (You might even argue that Jacob Frye is emulating Ezio Auditore a little too much.)\nThat was my second mistake.\nI went ahead and purchased the gold edition for the game with having put a little time and research into the product. I came in with relatively low expectations due to repeated failures in Ubisoft's past, but was pleasantly surprised by the prologue. Jacob and Evie Frye are fascinating characters and genuinely enjoyable to play for the most part.\nHowever, this is not only an Ubisoft game, it's an Assassin's Creed game. What bugs and glitches I experienced at first were minor, at best, until the big one came. My hardware should have little trouble running this game on decent settings, yet despite that, I reached the infamous \"Stage 3\" train scene and fight.\nThis stage is known to cause immediate crashing, to which it has done to me aplenty. I cannot pass it, and in some cases, cannot even load to the main menu as a consequence of where my progress stopped.\nNow, I dislike the idea of \"thumbs down\"ing a game due to a performance issue I cannot resolve on my part...

Sadly I think this is one of the weakest titles in the series to date, to be fair however I haven't played Unity, Liberation, or Rogue so there is that.\nSo where to begin. On the plus side the games fighting mechanics and new assasination animations are top notch. However that and the graphical representations are about the only thing that are up to snuff in this one. There is so much of what could have been here (and as we know once Ubisoft releases a title for PC it is pretty much done baring a few cheesey dlc's). The skill tree was a nice touch BUT we have two different assassins to control with, supposedly, two different skill sets. The skill tree is identical all the way down untill you get to the very end of it. So the whole two assassin thing is basically a moot point until midway through the title.  Upgrading your gang was a nice touch but I hardly ever used them. I am in sequence 6 now and have hardly had a need for them, essentially I find it to be a money sink. There is also a fair amount to do with side missions and a ton of collectables if youre a completionist like me.\nNow the bad and there is a lot. This is one of the worst optimized titles in the series in my library, and it isn't even close. Granted I am running an OC'd 7890, but that card can handle anything I throw at it. This title runs barely runs a sustained 30fps.  If I can run R6 Seige, Elite Dangerous, and a handfull of others at a sustained 45fps with no issues on high graphics, why is it this title I must have everything set on low just to run it at 1920x1080? Just terrible.\nThen there is the story, or lack there of. In virtually every other title there is something to get you hooked on the characters and draw you in right from the start. That basic story telling aspect is totally absent from this title. The AC series is built on a great story and solid mechanics, The dev team only went half way here. Between vaugue references to the Main characters father and the whole \"Hey sis lets go free London\" there is NOTHING there.  I asked for a refund but because I forgot to shutdown my system and left the game running, steam hasn't given me one.

Just the game dynamics!\nYou take on the role of two assassins, Jacob and Evie Frye. Yes, you read it right. Two assassins!\nDon't like Jacob or simply tired of male characters? Play Evie! She is quite the blast.

I said, \"WOAH!\". Well, perhaps I shouted it...I don't know. I did have a literal nerdgasm though. The recreation of London is phenomenal! Wait until you guys see the Buckingham Palace or climb the Big Ben. It's simply fabulous.\nThe combat is still nice and easy with a mix of firearms and throwing knives. Both Evie and Jacob have a set of skills they can train and they have 2-3 unique abilities exclusive only to them. Whatever you decide to level make sure you grab lockpicking for opening chests! The locked ones are a guarantee to acquire schematics for cool weapons and garments.\nFighting is fluid, climbing has never been easier, voice acting is great, the story line feels flushed out, and the world is marvelous. However, it's not about being the assassin anymore as it is about saving London.

After ACIII, I became completely desinterested in this series, yet I somehow continued playing it. After slugging through Unity (on PS4 no less), I was done... then ACS was on sale very short after release and the reviews said, the game is not that bad...\nWell, for the first few hours, it isn't. It's quite competent. It looks really nice, runs well, if you have the PC that can run it, plays a bit better than the games before it in the series. But then you get into the completely pointless story, that doesn't engage you in any way. Cardboard cutouts of characters interacting with each other to no point. A shoehorned love plot, that has not earned its right to be in the game (suddenly one main character has feelings for another guy... but we're not shown why or how it happened. It just happens).\nThe main story arc can be explained in maybe two minutes. The rest is filler. There's no twists, no turns. Just \"kill that guy\" and find the MacGuffin. Nothing else... but it's stretched to a good 10 to 20 hours (if you focus on the story).\nThe last two or three memories are THE worst, though. Suddenly, you get contacted by some guy... that sort of wants to play a game with you and your enemies. It's 4 missions, or so, of complete filler, with mission designs directly lifted from the open world\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665you're tasked to do to free London anyways. And in the end, he \"betrays you\" and you kill him. Completely out of the blue. No real connection to the rest of the game. Seems like it was supposed to be DLC, but it wasn't good enough to sell on its own, so it was boxed with the game.\nAnd climax makes you play f*cking GTA taxi missions, for gods sake. And for what? Some irrelevanat dialogue of a guy you only met once before and you'll never meet again, about stuff that doesn't matter in the game at all. Only for him to give you some plans.\nSome missions forbid you to do the stuff you do all the time... like kill people. Why? Doesn't tell you... in some missions, it doesn't even tell you that, beforehand. You just fail, if you kill... only then you know. Some \"additional mission incentives\" make you not kill Templars. That goes against what the Assassins do. WHY would a 100% sync make me NOT kill them? No reason given. This doesn't happen often, but it stands out.\nI was actually getting angry at the game in the end. It was such lazy mission design. None of it stood out. The story, the missions, everything was lazily thrown together to meet the deadline of christmas. Given, it works a lot better than Unity did on release... but I think Unity was, at least to some degree, a better game with a more engaging story (and that says a lot, since I didn't like Unity that much, either)\nThe endboss is... boring... I'll leave it there.\nSo... in the end, save you some money. Rather get Black Flag, Brotherhood or AC2. All of those games are miles better than Syndicate, run better on older hardware, and have much better mission design.

I strongly doubt they are reading steam reviews, nor would they care. But hey who knows.\nFirst off, gorgeous game you have made here. The graphics are really REALLY nice on my pc. It's also pretty well optimized. Good work.\nLike with all AC titles I've played (most on console) This game had a great story, interesting and funny characters, some new mechanics and gear. It is a good game, and IMO is better than Unity.\nWith all that being said, this game is clunky. Movements are not subtle or responsive. There are many areas where you should be able to climb/drop/zip, however, evie and jakob will always seem to find one of these spots and become motionless and unresponsive for long enough to be shot or seen.  This is a problem. You really need to test these games more before you put them out. It's not fair to your customers to pay 60 dollars to fight through these bugs. Yeah you usually get them in the updates, but that's not what I pay for. I want a finished, professional, glitch free game when I shell out 60 dollars.\nIn the same subject, while ALL of the animation is beautiful, some of it is not needed. Some of it is actually detrimental to the gameplay. Jakob can jump 300 feet off of a tower into a pile of leaves, yet it takes almost a second to climb a 4 foot chimmney; Something he should be able to hop onto in one brisk movement.  Hell I can almost do that in real life and from my time played you can see im not what you would call \"physically active\".\nLastly, I think you guys need to do something really special for your next AC game. Since Black Flag, I think you have sort of... half\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 your last few titles. I don't mean it as an insult because the last few games have been good games overall. You just set the bar way too high when you made ACBF. The last few games have been good, but I think we may be ready for something new. the victorian/revolutionary periods ARE interesting, but a tad bland at times. Give us a full game set in China maybe. Or how about WW2??? What can you guys imagine up for a WW2 title? Templars infiltrate the NAZIS and you get to hunt them all down, flying and driving aspects, maybe para-assassins? The assassin base could be a captured Uboat that you can cruise to all kinds of environments like in black flag! How many copies of that do you think would sell?? A crap ton that's how many. No game will touch you. Make a full co op campaign and you will sell even more.\n7/10 buy it, you will enjoy it, just be prepared to scream at your computer a few dozen times.", "hours": 293.8, "user_id": "76561198062769774", "username": "delemus", "products": 45, "early_access": false}
{"product_id": "368500", "page": 181, "page_order": 5, "recommended": false, "date": "2016-01-12", "text": "Way back in 2007 I became an Assassin. I was thrilled to finally find a calling for my free running skills and an outlet for the hobby nearest to my heart: stabbing someone in the neck. I took to my calling with zeal, following the instructions of my mentor, and I prevented the Templars from getting the Apple. All of this left me with a sense of completeness, and I knew my place in the great struggle between Assassin's and Templars over the centuries. After the middle east, I spent many years in Italy as an Assassin, which were certainly the high years of my career.\nBut I no longer have the zeal I used to for our cause. In the end, it all seemed to take on new dimensions. We no longer became Assassin's devoted to the great struggle against the Templars. Instead, we grew tired and complacent, perhaps due to all the great inventions and sheer manpower we built up during the Renaissance. Eventually, we started letting all types of folks join, and this was clearly not an improvement. We even allowed, and glorified the role of, the Marquis De Sade to start using us to his own ends. A pederast and a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Who would have thought we'd find the Assassin order teaming up on that side. We had already allowed pirates in, clearly another mistake, which only further diluted our moral position. I feel like there was a real subtle message there as well...had we become bored? Bored of being Assassin's that we now wanted to be pirates?\nWhich brings us to the industrial era of London: two Assassin twins who are literally bored with sitting around in the country side. Can I blame them? We now post assassins off to do nothing on farmland. We clearly had greatly lost a great deal of assassins by this time, especially since I remember in the Renaissance calling members of the order in for helping me. Instead, these two twins start a street gang. Let me repeat that: bored with hanging out on the farm they instead start a street gang. Where is our great moral position against the Templars? With all this disillusionment, I gradually found myself no longer trying to strive to conquor the city. I eventually became feared enough by the Templars that they stopped attacking me, and I could just go about living my life. I often found myself, when off trying to complete some perceived valuable mission, stopping at the park instead. I watched as couples danced to a band. I watched men play cricket, a game I still could not understand from watching. I watched children run soccer passing exercises. Out of no where, I noticed a small group of men kicking a man on the ground. I pulled my pistol out and fired a round into the air, scaring the men and driving folks out of the park. Repercussions for this action? None. You see that's kinda what it's like now to be an Assassin. I just walk through the front door, waving my gun in the air, blasting off rounds. My street gang does the same. You see, you don't have to even get your hands dirty, just send your thugs in and they will murder everyone in the place. When they die, call in another carriage of them. I just stand around, indifferent to the murder because it simply isn't what it used to be.  It's no longer necessary to be an assassin, to be stealthy, to use your hidden arm blade. It wouldn't make a difference if it was hidden or not. Stabbing people in the street with a kukri or shooting them has literally no consequences as you cross London, leaving a wake of dead in your path. You don't need to free run anymore either: very early in you get a grappling hook that jerks you to the top of buildings. I left the park where I had invertently disrupted everyone's day, and felt embarrassed. On my way north of the park, headed towards Parliment, a young middle class lady yelled 'Stop Thief' and I gave chase. I caught up with the thief, and tackled her, only to realize that she was a very old homeless lady. I felt terrible. She needed whatever penny farthing she had stolen, and as I walked past Parliment I realized this is what the order had become: simply local vigilantes that used violence to achieve their goals and had no great passion anymore.\nWhere do we go from here? Presumably we'll end up soon in the modern day. What will be the point of it all then? Will we just be mowing down whatever human beings get stuck in the crossfire of our silly struggle? The Templars have brought a number of things that work pretty well, communication networks, banking systems, healthcare... It might be time to step back and let them work out their plan. I _LIKE_ supermarkets. They make my life simpler and easier, even if they're owned by some shadowy large corporation. And it's clear most people like them too.\nIt might be time to hang up the Assassin order's spurs I think. We no longer have the passion we started with, the dedicated training, or the moral high ground.

They both like to state incredibly contrived logic like \"Don't let personal feelings jeopordize the mission\" despite the fact that the only reason they are in London is because they disobeyed their superior and botched their other mission.\nAlso the Henry x Evie romance is the absolute worst forced romance I have ever seen in a game. And Henry himself is just about the most \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing useless and unneeded character in any game. He exists to create tension for Evie, that is literally it. And he ends up being the one who \"Saves\" both Jacob and Evie in the most convoluted manner imaginable.\nA character who is supposedly immortal gets stabbed by Henry, now he's all of a sudden mortal? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 off Ubishit.\nCombat is so incredibly easy on everything but enemies who are at least twice your level, and then they only kill you in one hit, they don't get new gear or better at fighting, they just take longer to kill and instantly gib you if you fail to press the counter button after the game flashes a big yellow \"I AM GOING TO ATTACK\" signal above their head. And that brings me to my first actual complaint; Why the level system? It's fine to do that with the main character, gives us some progression, but giving enemies metric asstons of health doesn't make your combat harder or better, just slower. And blocking off areas of the game with simply \"harder enemies\" doesnt ACTUALLY stop people from doing these missions that you are trying to keep us from doing. Which ends up being for no reason at all because we can't equip certain items that we got as rewards for these \"difficult\" missions until we reach an arbitrary \"level\" which only increases once you have spent enough \"experience\" to buy skills.\nThat being said, Victorian London looks \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing, and the clothing is pretty awesome to look at, though why Jacob is incapable of wearing a hood AND standing up is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing beyond me.\nThe weapons are all pretty cool, but the clean and smooth combat animations of AC 2 are long and dead, and replaced with overexagerated choppy animations where you end up teleporting either yourself or the enemy within a certain distance in order to see the same execution animation for the 1200th time.\nThe story is the same copypasta bull**** that you've seen for like 5 times now. Templars bad, Assassins good, kill templars to prevent them from getting another made up piece of Jesus memorabilia, kill enough Templars so you can get to the big bad Templar who usually isnt actually a bad guy and is trying to use Jesus memorabilia to make the world a better place, kill him anyway, then dont use Jesus memorabilia because it's \"Too dangerous\".

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 185, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-01-06", "text": "My review is split into two parts: Gameplay and Story. It's in categories to make it as friendly as possible for the tl;dr crowd. I played through the main story, did a handful of side quests, conquered all districts in London, and played the World War I side quest; so that's what my review is based on. I'll be making some comparisons to \"Assassin's Creed: Unity\" and other games in the AC series, so if you haven't played one of them or another, bear with me, I'll try to be as descriptive as possible.\nGAMEPLAY:\nGraphics: A moderate improvement over Unity, and a pretty big improvement over Rogue and Black Flag (which are very similar to each other). My favorite part by far about the graphic performance is that  it maintains an equal-to-better graphic quality, unlike Unity, my computer doens't complain about graphics settings constantly. Bottom line about graphics: Vivid detail, spectacular vistas, and far smoother than Unity did it.\nControls and character movement: True to the Assassin's Creed norm, the movement isn't perfect. There are still a few glitches; HOWEVER for this game, my experience encoutered only one or two movement glitches in 41 hours of gameplay. That's impressive, especially compared to older games like AC III. As for controls, there are still some problems with the character doing what you want them to do (for example, in the second-to-last mission, I tried to hide behind a wall, but I ended up hanging off the wrong side and being spotted). The position the character is standing matters, so make sure you're paying attention to that when making sensitive moves. One big problem is with blending. It's quite difficult to blend into a crowd. Sometimes, the blend doesn't even happen and you get spotted. Luckily, you're usually given enough other  infiltration options in a mission to where it's not impossible to go without constant blending. One of my favorite methods of infiltration is the Syndicate-original move, the \"kidnapping\" function, where you can twist someone's arm and walk them into restricted areas without alerting attention (so long as you don't get too close or move too quickly). Overall, the controls and character movement are simple, straightforward, imperfect, but among the best yet.\nNew features of note (part 1/2): In addition to the aforementioned \"kidnapping\" move, there are several other positive additions unique to Syndicate. Another feature is  Syndicate added drivable horses and carriages as a vehicle. These allow you to traverse lots of ground in very little time. Their movement and control is smoother than pedestrian movement, but it still reuqires precision, lest you careen into a lampost, wall, police constable, or thug who will then try to kill you (which reminds me, I should also mention that they're not good for running people over). But all said, they are a lot of fun, and definitely a welcome addition to the game.\nNew features of note (part 2/2): The most highly anticipated new feature is the rope gun. It is excellent for escapes, infiltrations, and more. The only drawback with it is how its controls work. While I would have much prefered it get its own weapon slot where it could be freely aimed and fired, it has an automatic targeting system that is both less exciting and less reliable. Say you are on one roof facing another. on your screen, an \"R\" appears with a reticule. Press \"R\" and the rope gun gets fired at that spot, allowing you to shimmy by rope to the location you fired the rope at. If you are on the ground and approach a building, you will see an R with a quarter-arc under it, indicating you should look up. Looking up will reveal the same reticule, and pressing \"R\" will make your character use the rope gun to propel his or her self up to the ledge the gun was aiming at. It's almost as boring to use as it is to describe. I speculate that the point of this automatic reticule system is to save time and ease its use, but the drawback is it gets almost too easy at times, and at others, the reticule never shows up where you could swear it should (rare, but it's still happened a few times), forcing you to climb up manually. One other drawback of the rope gun is that you have to be standing or squatting, and stationary to use it. It cannot be fired while moving, and cannot be fired while standing on anything moving, such as a carriage, slow-moving train, or even-slower-moving steam ship traveling down the Thames. I really hope that wasn't an attempt to put a commonsense limitation on the rope gun to keep it from being too powerful a tool, because all it did was make traveling around the map more inconvenient.\nCombat: One big plus is definitely the combat style. There are upgradable features that give you more combo options. One involves being able to break an enemy's defense, then knock them over and shoot them in the face all in one move. Another involves being able to cut someone down who spots you after they're alert (red status), even if they've alerted other guards. Older games had that problem. You couldn't do an assassination as soon as the red diamond showed, even if they hadn't moved, or were themselves not aware of your presence. These additions don't make combat too easy, but instead add an aspect of combat that makes it more interesting and fair, and also acts as a motivator to level up and earn these new moves. The only disadvantages of the new combat format is the weapon variety. For those who love to fight with their hidden blade, I've got bad news: it's only used for assassinations in Syndicate. Also, the people who love huge varieties of weapon styles and choices might be disappointed as well. There are only three types of melee weapons: Kukri (Napalese short sword), metal knuckles, and sword cane. There are different styles and stats, but they're all basically the same thing. I was hoping that for a game with two playable main characters, each with their own specialty (Evie is the stealthy one, Jacob is the brawler), there would be specialized weapons for each character that reflect their specialty, as well as reflecting some of the vast choices we had in other AC games (e.g., heavy weapons like the Claymore for Jacob). But despite that drawback, the variety of ranged weapons are on-par. More importantly, the overall combat experience is still my favorite of any AC game.\nLockpicking: This gets its own category because of how happy I am that Syndicate deviated from the frustrating lockpick minigame in Unity. If you've got the level (of which there are two), you get in. It's just a matter of holding the \"E\" key down for long enough.\nCafting: The crafting is straightforward and simple. get the materials from chests and child thieves, build the thing. Like some of the older games, you'll need to craft things in order to upgrade ranged weapon power, ammo capacity, and character stats.\nSTORY\nBefore I start reviewing the story, a word of warning: DO NOT read Lydia Frye's database entry in the World War 1 sequence if you don't like spoilers.  But I digress. No matter how rocky the Assassin's Creed gameplay has gotten, the stories have always been well-written, and Syndicate is no different.\nThe overall plot is familiar, but plenty unique and well-written. Basically, you try to take Victorian London out from under the thumb of Templars and their pet gang. Along the way, you meet and work with a variety of interesting characters, including a collection of recognizable historical figures. Evie and Jacob are three-dimensional, form a good dynamic with each other and their allies, and altogether earn their spots as the main characters. The voice acting was great. The English and Scottish accents were well-articulated, just as good as Unity's, but are even better because Syndicate's characters actually are English and Scottish.\nBottom line: For the hours I played, I had a lot of fun and got to be part of a good story.

There\u2019s no beating around the bush here. No softening the blow. Combat in Assassin\u2019s Creed is a miserable, tedious affair. As much as I love running across rooftops and scaling towers and just feeling like a badass assassin, I just can\u2019t get over how lame the combat remains after all these years.\nI realize it probably hasn\u2019t changed much because Ubisoft sees Assassin\u2019s Creed as its big, annual cash-cow. Why fix it if it ain\u2019t broke? But that\u2019s a dangerous mentality. People will start losing enthusiasm over a series that comes out every year when all that changes, in any meaningful way, is the setting.\nWith games like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor out now, which borrows some from the Assassin\u2019s Creed formula but improves exponentially on its combat system, there\u2019s really only so long that Ubisoft can continue putting off a combat overhaul.\nAnd if the publisher/developer is worried that more casual fans would be put-off by a more demanding and engaging combat system, they could easily have difficulty modes like many other games (though this risks making the hard mode just frustrating rather than hard.)\nI just imagine an Assassin\u2019s Creed, with its big, beautiful open world, pared with the combat of Shadow of Mordor or Dark Souls, and my heart weeps. Because as I play Syndicate I just can\u2019t get over how easy and boring the combat is, how lacking the enemy variety is, and what a shame and waste that is for gamers and the game\u2019s designers alike.\nTime to shake things up. Time to really make a change with this franchise. The only game in the series I\u2019ve seriously enjoyed in years was Black Flag\u2014a truly wonderful pirate game. But even that entry could have benefited greatly from combat that was as compelling as its ships and setting.\nMaybe next year? While lots of high scores might assuage any doubts Ubisoft has about the franchise, I can\u2019t help but see interest waning from down here at ground level. Certainly I can\u2019t see how such high scores are even being given out to a game that has been widely critiqued for the same failures year-over-year.\nEven just fixing combat would probably make critics go crazy with hype.

But here is what I think is good and horrid cause there is no bad with this bloody thing.\nPROS\nIt looks decent\nIt plays well\ngrappling hook is ok (with leave that for later)\n...Shaun and Rebecca look decent?\nSetting is ok\nYou can play frogger in \"The Thames\" which is better than the game...is that a con?\nSmall problems\nStill glitchy but not Unity bad, Couple npc's glitch out.\nCONS\nYour main characters are a brother who is ok but boring, and a sister that trys to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 every man you meet in the story.\nCombat....OH COMBAT...All combat is either bs or boring af. There are these gang wars where you can have a 1v1 with the leader, but you see it's broken because you can spam attack and parry every once in a while. IT BREAKS THE COMBAT SYSTEM ENTIRLY!!!\nThe grappling hook is a cool feature but you remember when you would climb the coleseum and it was so satisfying to do that? Well with the press of a button you say \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 YOU and you ruin the parkour majorly when you could just zipline everywhere. OH AND BTW most of the time when you fire it at a building you will end of firing backwards into a spot you didnt want to be in!\nThe parkour is very good. it's still ruined by the hook but there is a very questionable design choice. Why is there a parkour UP button? I dont see a reason for it besides....well I dont see a reason for it!\nThe game has very little finishers which I have a problem with, it makes combat even more boring!\nThe shops have absolutely nothing to do besides double tab A (I use a 360 controler btw) and then hit B. YOU CARRY A \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665IN STORE, WORKBENCH, AND CLOSET WITH YOU SOMEHOW!!!\nYou can be \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in god at level 6 (lvl 10 is max).

Yes, you will need a Uplay account to play this, but it really is not that bad (you should link up your accounts so you don't have to login twice to play your games). I do not approve of everything Ubisoft does with its franchises, but this addition is a welcome one that fixes many of the problems previous entries in the series had.\nYou know how you used to get pulled out of an awesome pseudo-historical adventure to do boring real-world nonsense? Not so much here. The story is focused on Jacob and Evie Frye, a pair of twins out to liberate working class English people from the Templars. Though you can switch between the twins, both have exclusive missions that are worth checking out. Each has his or her own skill set to upgrade, unique gear to unlock, and of course, snazzy personalities. I love how colorful these two are and how utterly clueless they are when it comes to the work assassins do, but that's part of their rough charm.\nIn this game, we also meet a cast of awesomely diverse and wonderful characters from Alexander Graham Bell to Charles DIckens to Charles Darwin (he's fun, that one). There are some characters people probably will wonder at, like women running around in pants in Victorian England, and a trans man known as Ned with the best missions (IMHO), but though they are not historically accurate... they make the game more enjoyable due to their sheer vivacity. Besides, since when have AC games been historically accurate? I just love the cast in this game and the graphics are stunning to boot!\nThe graphics remind me a lot of Dishonored with the rich cityscapes and the vibrant colors. I absolutely adore this game to bits and I've only had it for a day. The world is gigantic and with so much to do, see, and the like, it's difficult to get bored. Syndicate is also more forgiving in terms of stealth. If you're like me and occasionally muck up on stealth due to impatience, you won't usually wreck your missions due to that. There are a couple that require not killing people, but by and large murders are not punished too harshly here and neither is revealing your presence. Believe me, that is a godsend when you are antsy to finish a mission.\nRescue missions are mercifully simple as well, with you just needing to punch a key to free children. Now, kidnapping is a pain in the behind and I do not have the hang of it yet (impatience is a big problem of mine). There are some finnicky requirements about being anonymous to do things and you do have to drive in some segments (carriages, more fun than cars, right?). However, you can upgrade carriages so that they are stronger and enemy carriages are weaker (again, godsend). You get to craft outfits, weapons, and weapon upgrades with things you find in chests throughout the world and via rewards for completing missions. Now, sadly, you do still have to buy ammunitions from merchants (some of which are located in the worst possible locations), but your hideout has a fast-travel ability when you get it and a guy is always there to sell you junk you may need. Again, minor issue that doesn't really matter because Ubisoft thought of everything with this one.\nThe PC controls are responsive and the feedback you get with the twins is good. Each twin has a unique personality. Jacob is a hard-hitter whose style is less stealthy and more in your face, while Evie is the stealth gal. Both can get the same upgrades, perks, and so forth, but they get skills separately. Combat is satisfying, albeit cops are somewhat annoying, but they are not omnipresent and a lot of combat can be avoided with perks later on (I can outrun most of my pursuers and vanish before they even get a bead on me). Climbing can be achieved with awesome grapples and zip lines or old-fashioned jumping up ledges. Almost everything is climbable, so you are never without a way out. Buy this game now and spaz out with me over its awesomeness! :D\nI love this game to bits! Good job, Ubisoft!\nI've had a lot of doubts about Ubisoft of late, but this brought me back into their fold and may convince me to try other AC titles in the future.

The dialogue clips from NPCs aren't so varied and the red=bad, green=good enemy gang motif is a little obvious but  it's fun nonetheless.\nThe adventures are, apart from an introduction mission, located entirely inside the main suburbs of London.  It's at first glance a large city but get in a speeding carriage and you quickly cross it. I guess we are seeing engine limitations here but even on max details it performed well at 1440p, not a very demanding game compared to GTA V or other recent titles.\nChallenges are fun and the missions often too but the lack of environmental interaction becomes obvious once you complete those missions- without the gang challenges or the other missions the city is an empty expanse.\nThe player is able to pursue their own agenda and choose to enjoy the incidental missions instead of adhere to the main plot- in fact I was able to clear the entire city well before completing the main plot sequence although this made later missions laughably easy, which is probably just as well as the finale with the piece of eden is pretty dumb.\nOf note is the games marked efforts to not only introduce a female character but to make her arguably better and more capable than her male assistant.  Evie is capable, makes sound decisions and has a strong stealth skill tree whereas her brother is feckless, dumb and has a skill tree related to flashy pistol moves that aren't terribly useful. Women also occupy more central plot roles, with not just Queen Victoria but a female entrepreneur and others. Still not 50\\50 but a big improvement over the flimsy roles of previous titles, on the other hand bear in mind this is still a flimsy plot so don't expect too much ;-)\nIt's good but not perfect, the lack of any countryside outside of London and the limited interactions with the city and it's denizens make it feel less open-world and more a \"box of bits\" but this is nothing new for the series and I would argue that only 2 and perhaps Unity broke this mould.", "hours": 69.4, "user_id": "76561198009061800", "username": "kickass", "products": 315, "early_access": false}

Note that I can't say everything that I need to write in the review since the word count is very limited so don't solely rely on my review.\nIt's the first Assassin's Creed series that is set on the Industrial Revolution Era. It's always lovely to explore new important historical times in Assassin's Creed with their great attention to details. I am not a history nerd myself so I can't judge how detail are they on the depiction of 19th century London but it is already quite impressive and satisfying like most Assassin's Creed series before.\n1. Bugs?\nThis is a very common thing to think before purchasing a newly released game. AC: Syndicate was no longer a new game and the hype was already dying when I finished the game, but bugs can still be found. All of the bugs won't jeopardize your missions but it will prevent you from finishing certain missions if it happens on the wrong place and the wrong time (e.g your character hold on to nothing in the middle of the street and unable to move)\n2. The Story\nBeautifully written but has little explanation as usual. Almost all Assassin's Creed series post Assassin's Creed Revelation has a lot of plot holes that are left unexplained because of massive difference in era between characters. You need to find out certain things by yourself if you haven't played the series before. The story is not new-user friendly and it is confusing (e.g you won't know who's Otso Berg without playing AC: Rogue). The point is, you're controlling twin Assassins called Jacob Frye and Evie Frye, coming to London to cleanse the city from Templar's imperious control and like usual, to find a piece of Eden.\n3. New features\nThe very first noticable change is the weapons. You will no longer use swords/axes/spears/flintlock rifles anymore but you will be given kukris/cane swords/brass knuckles as a melee weapon of choice instead. The firearm is obviously replaced with many different types of revolvers since it was booming in this era. So now you'll be able to shoot 2/6/8 in a row rather than having to reload for a long time after every shot, with your enemies capable of the same thing. You'll have to dodge bullets much more often compared to the flintlock era. Melee combat system is improved with its easy combo patterns and multi kills animations which looks really cool. The second most noticable difference is the way you travel around the map.  Previous Assassin's Creed series are dominated by parkours to travel around the map quickly, but now it's changed by a rope that can be shot from your gauntlet and carriages. You can climb buildings in no time and can zipline to any climbable objects, while roads are dominated by carriages. The game also have new gang war feature, two playable main characters, friends loyalty level, perks, unlimited eagle vision, massive skill tree, character level, and many other things.\n4. Is it worth it?\nTerribly overpriced, but yes. It's better to wait for a discount, though. The gameplay is worth more hours than Unity with its territorial gang war system and you can still play some short missions\neven after you finished the main story. The performance does not need to be questioned. It runs well on 50-75 fps on my laptop on max settings. I did not experience any fps lock.\nVery short main story but a lot of side missions. Unlike the main story where the side missions are limited to Child Liberation, Templar Hunt, Gang Stronghold, and Bounty hunts, the DLC has a lot more interesting choices. But still, there are much more negative sides for this DLC. FIrst of all, the weapon is only limited to low level brass knuckles. I started the DLC after I finished my main story with level 10 equipments, and I got a level 7 equipment on the DLC, with level 11 enemies. You will do very little damage to enemies since they are focusing on the new 'Fear' feature where you can spook your enemies so that they will flee battle. The massive downside is the bug. There are bugs everywhere both in main and side missions that WILL prevent you from finishing it. For example, your character will keep crouch-walking without you being able to control it, important AIs freezes in the middle of the mission, or the most annoying one, you will tend to accidentaly kill the NPC that you're supposed to kidnap, not kill, where it will trigger the freezing AI bug and you can't interact with it anymore.\nThis review is far from detail but I did explain the main points it as best as I could.

The story is alright, nothing to write home about.\nNow, the negative: What the hell is wrong with the ports for PC of this franchise? All the AC creed games I have played have had severe technical issues on PC. This title is no different and with no patches in sight, I am dismayed and hope I will never purchase another game from this franchise again even though I'm a sucker for it.

The last mission alternates between tasks for the pair of them. i liked this.\n- the side missions actually have more dept.\n- you can customize more of your characters then in the previous ACs\n- there is no more naval combat (dont get me wrong i think the naval combat is really cool but it never developed beyond \"avoid being blasted by them and then blast them yourself\" which is relatively shallow when compairing it to shore combat)\n- you can collect a number of gadgets during the game that did not appear in previous ACs. my favorite is the zip line which allows you to climb buildings fast.\n- this game has no \"present time\" interruptions beyond a movie based story.\n- the in game world looks verry nice.\n- there is a lot of humor in the stories.\nDislikes:\n- The loading screen. i dont know why but for some reason your character gets about 30 seconds to run arround in an empty space... this gets boring really fast. why not just load the next map and be done with it?\n- At the end of each act (for some reason) the game always crashes during saving. i have attempted updating drives/windows and all that nonsense but the issue persists. Checking the forum reveals that i am not the only one haveing crashing issues. This is unaccaptable when a game is newly released but considering the fact that the game was released a while ago makes it even more rediculous. That being said... i just restarted the game and picked up where i left off so the impact of the crashes on my personal gameplay was minimal.\n- for some reason i noticed occaisional grapic glitches in the highlighting mechanism which caused by entire screen the filled with bars of light eminating from the thing i was highlighting. This was annoying because i could not see what i was doing.\n- mircotransactions... yes they are also present here... allthough i did not use them myself. and my gaming experience did not suffer because of this thankfully\n- there are two chracters but they basicly have the same skills. Sure the guy (jacob) can carry more bullets then the girl (evie) and evie can carry more knives then jacob but still the differences are rather shallow. This was a disappointment.\n- there is only one mission in which the characters actually coperate to accomplish a goal. if you have two people they should work together more to accomplish objectives.\n- for some reason my character sometimes refuses to climb stuff... i find myself mashing spacebar for a couple of seconds and nothing happens. this was really annoying in timed missions.\n- racing with chariots sounded verry nice but it is not as developed as i hoped it would be. it got annoying really fast. but i just ignored most of the race missions and moved on.\nOverall steam asks me: would you recommend this game... and i would say: YES. Allthough i would not pay more then 30 euros for it myself due to the issues i mentioned above (so get in a sale). currently i would rate the game 6/10. 7/10 if they fix the grapics issues and crashes.

Forcing me to restart from a check point or even canning the quest and restarting the game. The idea behind having basically two skill trees to play with in Evie and Jacob is nice.. But all in all it is a mute point. Because leveling is extremely easy to do in the game and each tree doesn't have unique enough options in my opinion to even really be of \"much\" value by the time you hit level 10.\nPros:\nGraphics +\nStory +\nAtmosphere +\nCons:\nQuest Bugs -\nMovement Bugs -\nSteam/Ubisoft Integration -\nOverall:\n8/10", "hours": 30.7, "username": "Hotbabe16", "products": 365, "early_access": false}

Graphics are great, and the way NPCs moves aound while sometimes interacting with each other, works great.\nThe siblings, Jacob and Evie, are very likeable characters, voice acting is excellent and story is good. Ubi also did a great job with most of the other toons you'll encounter, no complaints at all here.\nThe game runs flawlessly on my system, no notable frame drops, or other issues. Again, this is NOT another Unity, Ubisoft actually did a great job this time.\nI really like most of the main story missions, but getting full synch (doing various extra objectives during the missions, for those who don't know), is very, very easy this time around. Too easy, I'd say. Well, at least up to the point where I'm at now.\nThere are lots of side missions and activities around the city, which adds to the fun. The problem, though, is that ALL of them are very, very repetitive, and gets old way too quick.\nThe main new feature of the game, is probably your gang. When you do various objectives in a district of the city, you'll eventually have to defeat whoever's being in charge of the gang, then you take control. The idea is that you're building a gang of members who can be recruited to help you in missions and activities. And here lies the problem, my only BIG issue with this game:\nGangs suck! Period!\nI've stopped using gang members, because they add a lot of problems, and no real benefit. This is mainly because of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 AI, but there other issues too. For example, after getting the gang ability that gives them ranged weapons, they headshot me almost every time I try to have them join me! Killed by friendly fire gets old almost immediately... Also, in some side missions, they tend to rush in and kill the main NPC, and I don't get credit, meaning I have to leave the area to have it resetting itself.\nOverall, it's a great game, which I recommend strongly.

As a result, I didn't expect Syndicate to be fun when I purchased this game, I simply bought it because I had the money at the end of the year and it was on sale (sort of). However, in my opinion, Syndicate is the best AC game so far. The game really emphasizes the personalities of Jacob and Evie, how their goals differ, how they argued and competed in a sibling rivalry way, and this really touched my heart. Ubisoft really stepped up their game (literally) and put in effort in the development, which is something that I have never felt in Unity. I liked their idea of liberating the city in another way, the blackbox kills, the city of London with her bustling engines and carriages, and their most interesting side missions involving historical figures yet (even though this has been done before in previous games, Syndicate did the best job). It seems like Ubisoft has finally realized their failure in the present-day storyline and has chosen to deviate from it quite a bit in Syndicate; to many this is even worse but to me it showed me that Ubisoft has realized their mistake and is now trying to fix it by using only short cutscenes instead of meaningless playthroughs, and this is a good start (cutscenes still show instereting story).\nI was so drawn into this game that I completed the game in merely two days (two days, but I have 24 hours on record in two days), and I am by no means saying that the game itself is short even though it can be made longer. For me, the ending is not amazing, but it is by no means bad at all unlike IGN's review. As a fan, I dare say that I have moved on from Ezio, and that Jacob and Evie are my new favorite assassins. And yes, the Season Pass is worth the money for many reasons.\nPros:\nCharacter development\nStory\nEvie's outfits\nNew & fast paced combat system\nUnique and cool-looking weapons\nGood graphics\nCarriage riding and chasing\nTwo playable and (mostly) switchable Assassins\nCity liberation missions\nAssociates of the Brotherhood\nTwo types of NPC's: Aggressors and Protectors\nYour gang that fights for you\nSibling rivalry\nRope launcher\nNew leveling system and skill tree\nBadass, mobile Assassin Hideout\nSmoothed parkour/free running\nAmazing background music and soundtracks\nKidnapping people\nBig yet useful world (unlike ACIII's frontiers)\nBritish accents\nCons:\nJacob's outfits\nNo co-op\nCan only wear hood when crouched/stealthed\nMicrotransactions still here even though not necessary\nPoorly managed weapon rewarding system (missions unlock weapons w lower stats)\nNo significant difference in the skill trees\nEvie's cape's animation (didn't notice until I saw other reviews, but yes it is like 20fps)\nMinor glitch in the inventory where they mark some equipments as new items even though I have had them for a while\nOverall, 9/10. Best AC game so far, good story, strong characters, new level systems, weapons, and skilss. Definitely would recommend. Season pass is worth it (for the first time).

Another is that the supposedly \"secret\" societies of the Templars and Assassins walk around with public badges. Yet another is that the Templar plots are sometimes shockingly incompetent.

Ubisoft is finally approaching towards the right path after the Unity mishaps. This game itself is quite enjoyable to play but it isnt perfect. There are many aspects that makes this game quite good, but there had been shortcomings which were not pleasant (maybe they'd be avoided in the next game?). I've listed a few things below which I'd like to see in the next game, if there is one.\nSPOILER ALERT.\nPros:\n-Performance is quite stable in my rig.\n-Great detailing of the architectural structures and the overall open world map.\n-Like the idea of skill development and upgrading the gang, finance and other aspects.\n-Good story line and characters.\n-Fighting with the Blighters felt quite challenging at the beginning, which is good.\n-Like the idea of new gadgets, i.e. rope launcher, voltaic bomb.\n-Introducing fight clubs and other activities were good, but it could be better esp. the carriage racing.\n-Like the idea of having backup from the Rooks, but there is always room for improvement in their intelligence.\nCons:\n-The story is too short! 9 sequences?! Why? It feels too abrupt.\n-The stories of the main characters could have been developed in a much better way, again the pace is too fast! I guess no one can beat the character build up of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\n-More open world interactions, like getting into buildings, shops etc like in Unity. Getting into the great British structures, landmarks etc would have been good.\n-Maybe I'd like to craft the items that I actually want to use, and not craft every single thing on the menu?! Why should that matter for full synchronization of the game?!\n-Expected the associates to be more helpful and have significant roles in the storyline than to provide schematics, rewards from petty theft etc.\n-No present world interaction. Some previous games like Brotherhood, Black Flag had some but still it wasnt enough. It would be good to incorporate Shawn, Rebecca, Galina etc as playable characters. Plus, I'd like to know more about the identity of the initiate. Why is he even helping the Assassins?\n-Side missions felt too easy and predictable.\nI'm not saying that the game isnt good, I'm only suggesting the things that could have made my experience of playing this game even better.", "hours": 144.3, "username": "Mercy", "products": 50, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Not the most promising way to begin a review, but oh well.\nFirst, I'm not a big fan of the combat system. The Features List boasts a new dynamic fighting system, but to me it felt sluggish and weak. I much prefer the feeling that I got from the combat system in Black Flag. That system felt more intuitive and it looked much better (in my opinion).\nSecond, progression felt slow. By itself, that might not be a big issue. However, with the frequency in which \"get micro-transactions\" is pushed on you, I felt like the progression of gear, items, etc... was purposefully slowed down to encourage the purchasing of these microtransactions for XP boosts, resources, and money. I simply don't like paying for a game, only to be constantly pushed towards spending more money. Especially when the amounts it's asking to spend add up quickly to much more than what the original game cost me.\nThird, the Thames feels like a frogger game. Again, by itself that's not too big of an issue. It's fun jumping from boat to boat. It creates an interesting moving landscape to fight and explore on. HOWEVER, when you remember how amazing ships and water were in Black Flag, this system is pretty pale in comparison. Yeah, they're both two different games. But if you played Black Flag and came to this game, it'll feel like you (And Ubi) are taking two steps backwards.\nFourth, The carriage system is kind of interesting, but gets boring fast. Once you've tried out the various types of carriage and have done a few of the carriage-based activities, you end up feeling like you've done it all. Which isn't too big a deal, because you've got the completely impossible hook gun thing. You end up feeling more like a gadget-base superhero than an Assassin. But it is fun being able to shoot a zipline between long distances to get around the various smokestacks and other tall structures of London.\nAnd that brings me to the Fifth, I didn't feel like an Assassin except for very infrequent instances. The game is still fun, but it doesn't feel like much of an assassin game. More like a \"Gangs of New York\" game. If you play as Jacob's sister, it feelts a tad more like an AC game, but it's still kind of weak.\nSixth, the gang features, despite being a big part of the game, end up becoming repetitive. Once a take control of a territory, that's it. Maybe things change later in the game? But so far, you claim an area and cannot invest, improve, or anything of that sort. After I claimed a couple of territories, I ended up thinking, \"What's the point?\" and I sort of lost interest in it (and by proxy, the rest of the game).\nSo, six 'big' issues with the game. However, I still enjoyed my time. The setting is fantastic, the game looks amazing, and it's still pretty fun. Honestly, if I could go back and tell myself the issues I had with the game, I wouldn't buy it for $60. I'd wait until it's on sale or something. Here's to hoping that the next AC game will be more like Black Flag in terms of features and combat, while also implementing the improvements seen in Syndicate.", "hours": 12.9, "username": "Apoca", "products": 292, "early_access": false}

I'm talking about Assassin's Creed, the now-yearly installment of a game franchise that by rights ought not to exist.\nIn the years since 2007's original game, we've visited strange locales, met historical figures, and promptly murdered the lot of them in ways that are historically implausible. But whatever, it's been a fun romp.\nSure, there were moments of desperate anger, like the squandering of a Musketeer-based assassin in AC: Unity (seriously, you go to FRANCE and don't give me Athos, Prothos, and Aramis? You are bad people, Ubisoft).\nBut for all Unity's faults, obviously the 100% completely separate team working on AC: Syndicate was on the ball. Once again, we have engaging main charactesr (Jacob and Evie), who have separate and distinct playstyles, personalities, and philosophies. I found myself wanting to complete certain missions as each character, even if they weren't to their particular strenghts (gang stronghold with Evie? Sure, why not?).\nThe historical figures, ranging in this case from Charles Darwin to Karl Marx, are all wonderfully realized, and the sheer number of side missions/time-wasting activities cut down from AC: Unity. Gone also are the external smartphone apps just to open a damn chest. Thank the Father of Understanding for that one.\nOn the negative front, the game is somewhat scaled back in terms of the graphical mettle from AC: Unity, by which I mean crowds are noticeably thinner. This dramatically helps performance, but I was never truly \"wowed\" by the graphics in this game. It looks great, of course, but nothing exceptional.\nThe controls are still janky as all hell. At this point, a jank-free Assassin's Creed game would feel so vastly unfamiliar that I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I'd probably end up in a corner, rocking back and forth, crying, \"but when I wanted to dive off the wall and tackle the bad man, the game let me! I didn't zoom into outer space for no discernible reason!\"\nThere will be frustrating moments fighitng the controls. Some of the mission types are bad bad bad bad. Not quite as terrible as the tailing/eavesdropping missions, but kidnapping a single reprobate out of the middle of a park that is simply lousy with guards is dumb. I think I gave poor Freddy a heart attack because I always brought those dipsticks back dead. Sorry Fred, it was just too difficult, and in the ensuing chaos, I killed literally everyone.\nIf the pattern holds, 2016 will have us performing some truly abysmal atrocities during World War I, probably starting with a botched assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. And then in 2017, we will get a World War II-era AC, with missions in both the Pacific Theater and the European Front, culminating when we get to kill Hitler. If this prediction turns out to be right, I want you all to mark this post as the time when I apotheosized into a prophet, and found my church upon this rock.", "hours": 38.8, "username": "Dunyain", "products": 297, "early_access": false}

Now hear me ramble...\nThe first game, was amazing, with never before seen freedom of movement, it looked fantastic and the concept was very original. Yet the game felt like a... proof of concept, fantastic for a demo, but I wasn't ever on the edge of my seat... It turned out to be quite repetitive and only had a mediocre story. Still... I completed it, searched for all the damned flags... I don't know why, but I did.\nThe second game, was groundbreaking in it's own way, but the story was again quite superficial and the Desmond storyline already started to annoy me. I got tired of the first civilization, the pieces of Eden, all that stuff. Finished it and finished Brotherhood and Revelations as well, just to be sure I got everything out of Ezio.\nAC3 was a bit less enjoyable. It was getting prettier and the controls became a bit more refined and a few new additions made it worth playing. The main problem was again the story... especially the Desmond stuff...\nBlack flag certainly made waves... har. Sailing the Caribbean and plundering ships, was really fun at first, but after a few hours this also became quite repetitive, this sadly is no Sea Dogs. The story was mediocre again, Kenway was superficial and clich\u00e9, but a welcome improvement to AC3, I must say... No Desmond storyline anymore... sort of... exiting the Animus however was annoying yet again. Still, the pirating made the AC series feel more interesting again. I must say that battling the legendary ships was pretty fun!\nAfter the black flag... the black sheep... Unity... and yet... for some reason this really capture my attention. I didn't have any bugs, no technical problems and a DLC for free, so I didn't have reasons to complain. I think it still looks amazing, much better than Syndicate for some reason... And as a plus, outside of the Animus, there was little to nothing to be done, great! The piece of Eden crap was also less intrusive and apart from making the rest of the game very easy, it didn't really have that much of a negative effect on my experience. The facial animation was sublime, the mocap worked like a charm and the actors could really have supplied this game with a boost... if only the story and the dialogues were any good. Sigh... Another wasted opportunity... I'll come back to this game when the DLC gets cheaper. I really don't want to spend more money on a few more generic missions, but I'd like to spend more time in that gorgeous city... Oh and I wished one of my Steam friends had played it cause the co-op missions are a blast with good players!\nFrakking Syndicate... I've completed 7 AC games with mixed feelings... still I would prefer to rant about this game than to play it... bad sign. The story is... absent... isn't it? Characters are paper thin; they don't have any motivation, their dialogue is stupid, etc... Oh... I did like that top hat...\nThere was no need for technical innovation in this game, Unity is gorgeous, the engine proved to work... well... after a few updates... There's no change in game mechanics; Unity's were sublime... Did they spend that production money on the same brilliant art direction? Syndicate looks artistically less refined than Unity... so I guess not. Yes they built a new city... great... but Paris looked more impressive, much more detailed and more diverse... so where did the money go? Story? Nope... Level design? (From what I can tell so far) Hell no... Oh yeah... the carriages... that must have set them back a few pennies...sigh\nIt's likely Ubisoft's way to get some of the money from Unity back... no innovation, no big investments this time\u2026 maybe they really only worked on it for a year... Unity probably cost a hell of a lot of money ($150 million) and had a disappointing release (still in my opinion it was (at least technically) as much a milestone as 1, 2 and 4. Syndicate... isn't at all). But if Ubisoft released this to cover some losses, all fine by me. But I just wished they spent a bit more attention on story and character development... Just imagine what could be done in this period... Of course... then I remember friends of mine saying they don't really watch the cinematics... don't really care about the story... etc... the main audience will be happy with the action, so no matter what city AC is set in, it will sell... so why invest more... ?\nI'm not happy about that though... it has SO much potential... the framework is close to perfect! The writers and director from say \"The last of us\" would make this game a juggernaut!\nSigh...  I hope they rearrange their priorities a little bit... Make it a more story centric game... they could still push in as much free running as they want... I especially hope the next AC game doesn't have anything to do with the pieces of Eden... Why not simply use the Animus technology to get first hand accounts of important historical events and sell it as historical adventures? I just hope they get the story problems solved before they ever make Assassin's Creed Japan. Because not making it, would be less damaging to me than making a bad one. Maybe I\u2019ll try to get a job there\u2026 actively work at the problem for a change\u2026 I'm sure the movie will have a fantastic screenplay... frak.", "hours": 56.3, "user_id": "76561197993897238", "username": "accident", "products": 152, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 207, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-16", "text": "I am writing this review from the perspective of a long-time fan of the series.\nIf you find the modern day story of the Battle between the Assassins and Templars to be the main reason why you play the games then you won\u2019t get much out of this game. This is specifically where the Ezio trilogy was at its best. It does advance the game forward slightly, but there is little interaction between the modern day story and the London of 1868. You could easily skip this game because the furthering of the modern plot can probably be summarised in a sentence. To be fair, that one sentence worth of modern story is probably the most interesting thing that has happened since the end of 3. However, it\u2019s not worth playing the entire game to see what could be an interesting setup for the next game\u2019s modern story.\nAfter the Ezio trilogy came the American games (3, Liberation, 4, Rogue), and these had a new focus. So while the Ezio trilogy had a thrilling modern day story, it was very poor in giving any detail as to the motivations or structure of either the Assassins or Templars. It is in the American games that the theory and philosophy and structure of the organisations is the focus. It is also in the American games that the modern story basically grinds to a halt. Syndicate continues the focus the American ones started. Syndicate does a decent job of examining the founding principles of order and freedom. However, while it does a decent job at this, it doesn\u2019t do it better than the previous games in the American stories, in my opinion. In other words, I don\u2019t feel that it added any special insight that previous games hadn\u2019t already touched on.\nI personally feel Assassin\u2019s Creed is at its best when you start off with a protagonist who is skilled, intelligent, and wanting to make a difference. In that regard Syndicate is once again decent. The Frye twins can be described that way, but they don\u2019t have a specific overall drive that Altair, Connor, Aveline or Shay has. Though while Syndicate\u2019s story is not particularly ground breaking, nor the character arcs particularly surprising, it does an excellent job of telling its story. The characters are likable, there are many light hearted moments, and many side characters have their moments too.\nSyndicate feel like a complete gameplay improvement. (I mention here that I haven't played Unity,)\nThe actual London environment is very engaging. One thing you might notice straight away is that the enemy forts are actually parts of the real environment. So while previous games usually had you infiltrating an actual fort which was specifically a military environment filled with only the military, Syndicate has you infiltrating factories and buildings with normal people going about their business. Though I should mention that while there are often people in the buildings, they don't change anything at all in terms of gameplay, except on rare occasions for use as social stealth.\nBuilding interiors are incredibly important now, rather than being basically non-existent in earlier entries. While this is a personal feeling, London and its environs feel the most like an actual city that you are walking, and less like a parkour playground. While previous games were, arguably, realistic, your traversal of them was not. Syndicate presents a world which is more similar to the one an average person would frequent. You obviously still climb over the top of everything, but you also spend a lot of time inside buildings.\nThe stealth system is also revamped, and it allows you to navigate these new environments. Not only can you now switch between stealth and normal walking at the press of a button, you are also once again capable of using social stealth.\nOther new things you can do include a new activity called kidnapping. While there are plenty of side missions where you can use this new gameplay mechanic, the great thing is that it\u2019s useful outside of the side missions requiring it. You also now possess a grappling hook, which allows rapid vertical traversal of buildings. It also gives you more freedom for moving across rooftops, and provides new opportunities for aerial assassination.\nThis game is a bit like \u2018Everything you have seen in a game\u2019 The Game\nThe introduction of the RPG system is decidedly odd, in my opinion. Each area of London is tied to a level. This means the enemies in the area are usually that level, and all the side missions in that areas are also that level. This means that you are somewhat restricted in what order you progress across the open world. In previous games, and in all open world games, I personally would always do the side missions in whatever order I felt like, and would do the main missions when I felt like it. While you are not actually restricted from over levelling, it would probably serve to make the game too easy.\nThere is no story reason to restrict the order in which you do the missions. The majority of side missions contain no story, and the ones that do don\u2019t seem to contain anything that could contradict any other if done in a different order. If you do follow the intended order you reach a point towards the end of the game where you have to do a whole lot of story missions in a row because they are all set at a level that no area in the game has its missions set at.\nThere are now horse drawn carriages that operate a lot like cars. You can get on top of them and fight, and you can even jump between rooftops of two moving carriages. You don\u2019t particularly use the carriage in any interesting way outside of the missions, but where they are used they are used well.\nThe combat and feels a bit more like the Batman Arkham games. I personally hate the combat in Batman, but this moves a lot faster and I kind of like it. It feels a bit more open than previous games, but you don\u2019t have sword fighting any more as it\u2019s more brawling.\nYou have the ability to knock people out now if you take them out from behind and before they notice you. This is actually a non-violent method of taking people out. Functionally it is the same as killing someone, but it feels good to have it. It is harder than killing, and necessary to achieve some extra objectives.\nThe assassination missions are well designed because they provide flexibility in approach. And they also include a couple of side objectives that need to be accomplished before having the opportunity for assassination. They do a good job of providing a couple of specific challenges that you have gameplay freedom to achieve.\nThe extra objectives are also well designed. They are nearly always something that provides an actual extra challenge that can be overcome by skill. There were a couple that are based on things outside of your control, but there are far fewer of these times than there usually is in this series.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate has many little references and nods to previous games, though most of them are quite inconsequential.\nI recommend this game. The gameplay is full of well-designed mechanics. The London environment feels like it\u2019s full of life and Is full of little details. The story is decent. And while the story doesn\u2019t particularly surpass in any area what any other game in the series has done, it feels well balanced and you\u2019ll probably find something to like about it.\nP.S while I do think this game is very good, I\u2019m not sure if I will buy the next one because it doesn\u2019t seem to be moving in either of the story directions I mentioned. It doesn\u2019t really advance the modern story, and it doesn\u2019t really describe in any more detail the philosophy and motivation of the Assassins and Templars. I bought this because Rogue impressed me. This game doesn\u2019t particularly interest me in the next one.", "hours": 50.1, "username": "Electronic Toaster", "products": 369, "early_access": false}

But it's playable compared to Unity as long as you have a good PC. The story peaks before the end of the third act and the beginning is a tad long and boring. The game series still suffers from map mess and you spend more time \"playing the map\" rather than the game. I recommend to more or less focus on the main story since you're gonna be forced to do some side activies to progress the main story anyways. You'll rank up good enough without breaking a leg.\nThe two main characters are likeable and works best togheter, however the rest of the cast is pretty weak, except for the main villain. The game truly shines during the last mission of every sequence when you get to assassinate your target in different ways. Trust me on this one, always gor for the unique kill, it's by far the best one.\nThe re-creation of London is great and using the hookshot, or whatever you should call it, along with horse and carriage really speeds up the game a lot, in a good way. However I'm now a little concerned that the next game will feel slow if they don't shrink the playable area, or give you likewise tools to get around. I do however hope that the move backwards in time in the next game.\nAll in all it's a good Assassin's Creed game, something that I thought I was never gonna say after the disaster, also known as Unity. I'd say it's up in the top three games in the series along with AC2 and AC: Black Flag, even though AC: Black Flag is a very untraditional AC game, but nevertheless a solid one.\nI bought the game for 35 euro and played for about 20-25 hours.

I haven't had any gamebreaking bugs or glitches, and it has frozen only once. They learned their lesson from last year.\nNow that's out of the way I'll talk about the story. In 1868 London you play as Evie and Jacob Frye trying to free the city from the Templars. This story feels rushed in the beginning and the end, but the middle is steady. Evie and Jacob are much better characters than Arno or Shay and the Templar Grandmaster and his advisor are great antagonists. The modern day storyline is cutscenes between the sequences and it is better than Black Flag, Rogue, and Unity. Though I think it needs to have a new playable character to replace Desmond.\nThe gameplay is similar to the other games (surpise, surprise). The fighting is like Unity but much faster and fluid. The parkour system is improved only a little. The zipline you get is fantastic, so you can spiderman around the city. Freeing the boroughs of London is usually fun. Instead of a tower of control like in Brotherhood, you have bounty hunts, templar hunts, child liberations, and gang strongholds. Then when you've done them all, you have a gang war. It's a neat concept but gets repetitive. The unique assassinations are really cool if you want to do them. The side missions are decent. I am really tired of collectibles. To get the unique armor you need to collect 32 music boxes. Instead of going through an Assassin tomb, or the Lairs of Romulus, or the mayan stelae, you collect find them around London....yay fun.

And I was allured by the idea of using a gang to dominate london's streets.\nAfter AC3, which left me with a disappointment so big that I skipped on buying Black Flag, which in turn ended being one of my favourite assassin's creeds after I decided to play it in my brother's account. I deeply regret this, because the theme of pirates and plunder turned out to give Kenway a much better story than his grandson.\nThis one caught me by surprise, from the start they throw you into one of the missions of jacob and evie, working for the creed. A clever way to present how the Frye twins charge at their problems and to give you a glimpse of their personality. Jacob is a \"clever bloke\" cocky, and headstrong who wants to bring london back to the hands of the assassin's even if they have to become a gang itself, not that worried about the creed, but more focused on destroying the opposition, Jacob ends up giving a lot of trouble to the templars.\nMeanwhile Evie is a more collected but far from calm dutiful assassin, who wants to follow up on the lead that her father had on the Shroud of Eden, an artifact recovered by Edward Kenway and hidden in London making the story feel like a follow up to Black Flag's, which just makes it even more enjoyable.\nThe enemies this time aren't as strong as their leader, which appears with every few assassinations to remind you how much of a evil gentleman he is, giving you a small glimpse of the templar side from time to time. Some of the templars aren't as memorable as in other games, but one of the best things about this game is that every templar that you must kill comes with a set of tools that you can follow to kill him in a cool way, or do it yourself, making it feel like how the hitman games gave you alternatives to enter and assassinate your target.\nWhat this game lacks a bit is more important support characters for the Twins, there's no \"la volpe\" or the courtesans, or even the thieves from venice in AC2, and there's no manager of the gang, the rooks, which made the rooks seem more like a helping hand for you rather than something to get sad or invested in when they die during a mission.\nBut let's talk about mechanics a bit. This game adds carriages and the \"hookshot\" as I like to call it, that give you a different way to maneuver around. The carriages allow you to stay on top of them while a rook from your team drives for you, letting you fight your enemies or even jump to their carriage, kick them out and steal theirs, all of this seamlessly! it's an amazing work for sure. Back to the to hook, you can use it to easily reach other buildings in a faster way, giving you an alternative to just going through the building, and making it much easier to travel not only vertically, but between buildings, giving the tools to go from the river thames all the way to the top of the big ben in a much easier and quicker fashion. it's so enjoyable to just waltz around with these that you'll probably catch yourself strolling around london looking for more secrets rather than making the templar assassinations.\ntl;dr\n+Good Protagonists that actually make strong impacts in London\n+Lovely craftmanship of London and its Victorian Era of innovations and advancements.\n+Fight on top of carriages seamlessly and hijack the opponents carriage while you move away from the police!\n+Great maneuverability vertically and horizontally between the gothic architecture of the Victorian Era using the Grappling Hook.\n+A Moving Train Base with all your accomplishments decorating the walls!\n+An enjoyable story with references to the best past AC Games.\n+AMAZING Soundtrack full of violins packed with that london feel!\n-Lack of support characters related to your gang, making you not worry what happens to your gang when you use them in combat\n-Villains don't come around that often to give you that needed edge against the templars.\n-They still talk about the animus and the not so interesting story of shaun and rebecca, but just with videos, making it much better than having to play with desmond like in previous installments.\nOverall I had a blast with this game, The soundtrack is packed with accordeons and violins, that add a certain sherlock-esque, that just nails the london feel so well. Fighting is really enjoyable and rather than just being a prince of persia esque fight like in the early ac games, its focused on combos and killstreaks from punching people in the face, I strongly recommend you to play it if you were a fan of the series and wants a throwback to those good times of ezio, they made the right choice on not doing a multiplayer, letting them focus on adding more content to the main game.", "hours": 44.9, "username": "Sol Goodguy", "products": 448, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

So now I will give it the review it deserves.\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate is another great entry in the series after the faulty release of Unity.\nThis game is much more progressive, well made, and exciting than Unity was. While we have seen amazing entries in the series before like the Ezio games and AC4 and Rogue, this game still holds the high quality standard of an Assassin's Creed Game.\nIn this game you play as Jacob and Evie Frye, two Assassin Twins that fight to free London from the hands of the Templars and their rival gang: The Blighters. The game ties in new features and gang wars to create a newer, fresher experience in Assassin's Creed.\nJacob Frye is a loud tough dude, doesn't stick much to subtlety or stealth.\nWhile Evie Frye is the sneakier and more methodical character. And she isn't oversexualized or exposed like other videogame characters. No sexual moans in battle, and proper Assassin Robes that actually look like they should.\nCombat is new, faster and in my opinion more fun than before. In older games we saw different kinds of enemies that you would have to use different attacks on in order to defeat. In Assassin's Creed 4 it was more Counter everyone and use tools on people that you can't counter. In this game everyone can be countered, but the new system is much better in a way that I honestly can not describe. It's just good.\nThis game features a leveling system which lets the player unlock perks or skills. Some of these skills are new and exclusive to this entry (like extra damage on vehicles) and some are reasonable like extra damage on throwing knives. There is one complaint that everyone seems to have, that being you have to unlock double Assassinations. There isn't really any problem with this, in fact, it is the first skill you unlock in the game, and up until that point of the game it isn't even necessary or really even able to be used, so it's just a fine way of explaining the system.\nThe world is big, and you can go into World War 1 [the future (at that point in time)] to live part of the life of one of the Frye twins' descendants.\nThe game is full of great content.\nDLC:\nThere is quite a bit of DLC in the game, but none of it really takes away from the experience. There is a DLC of newer mission packs, and a lot of DLC for extra in game goodies, and cosmetics, none if it necessary or that big a deal.\nGreat Game.", "hours": 23.3, "username": "Vionic", "products": 282, "early_access": false}

The Victorian London setting brings a certain degree of comedy and sarcasm to each of the characters featured in the story. In turn this makes for an entertaining experience and leaves you begging for more.\nThe two new Assassins fit the game perfectly and are certainly inline with the likes of Ezio and the Kenways. The brother and sister relationship between the two make for great banter and bring variaty to the gameplay. Although at times it can feel like Jacob is the prefered Assassin in the story. Both are badass and deserve another game.\nThe game runs smoothly at a constant 60fps (that is with most 'Nvidea Gameworks' features disabled) and certainly outshines the performance of Unity. There are minor bugs here are there, but nothing to distract from the game world. To put it best, it's The Animus.

Since I finally finished the game to 100% completion, I thought now would be a good time to write a quick review.  After the Unity debacle, it was a pleasant surprise to see Ubisoft get this one right.  There were still a few in game glitches (people floating off the ground, ladder rungs not directly attached to a wall, etc.) but nothing that was game breaking to me.  Overall the graphics are gorgeous, and the game is able to maintain good framerate on relatively high settings (running on single NVidia GTX980 card), with no hitching, lagging or stuttering.  Only once did my character get stuck (under a dock jumping into the River Themes) and couldn't get out.  But fast travel got me unstuck.  The only other glaring bug (at least for me) was that unlocking certain items late in the game like cloaks and outfits) caused the game to have a brain fart and crash.  But reloading the game put me right back where I was supposed to be with the new items in inventory.  As I have stated, some minor annoyances, but nothing I couldn't live with.  I don't believe that any AAA title you play nowadays (as complex as they must be to make) are going to be completely bug free.\nThe only thing I wish for was that Ubisoft put more into the story.  The number of story missions didn't seem to be any more in number than the side missions, and they tended to be very short at that.  In my opinion at least they moved in the right direction as far as the technical aspects and playability of the game are concerned.   I am now waiting for the season pass stuff to be released so I can jump back in.\nI know some people were wishing for a multiplayer feature, which as I understand Ubi decided against so they could concentrate on getting the single player aspect right.  Perhaps with the next Assassin's Creed game, they can maintain the same level of quality but expand on more story and multiplayer.\nOverall, I'm glad in light of all the positive reviews I saw on Steam from day 1, that I did not have to wait for a bunch of bug fixing patches and was able to buy the game right away.   I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of the Assassin's Creed series.\nIf anyone from Ubisoft reads this review, all I can say is keep up the good work.  But don't forget that there is always room for improvement.

Sometimes I felt bad rushing through things and found myself taking walks just to enjoy the view.\nGameplay:\nThe game play is pretty smooth, I didn't have to much trouble Jumping and climbing. The Combat is intuitive and fun,there is also a decent variety of weapons. You may switch between the 2 assassins at anytime and they share Exp, money and weapons (but not armor) so you don't have to feel guilty giving too much attention to either one.\nStory:\nI personally find the Frye twins enjoyable these 2 rough assassins have very different idea on how to free London. The premise of the main story is to free london from the templars and find a peice of Eden. I can't spoil too much but you will meet famous historical figures such as writters and inventors, and it is very cool to see how they were imagined in this world. But since I started playing I could not put it down.\nI give this one:\n4.5/5 - Very redeeming after Unity, Enjoyble and Guns are too much fun.\nAlso:\nThis only reason this game is underrrated is because it was released at the wrong time, with the release of Fallout 4, Star Wars Battlefront, Just Cause 3 and Rainbow 6 seige.", "hours": 7.4, "username": "Dohnovahn", "products": 208, "early_access": false}

Ubisoft learned from Unity's failings, and has crafted an AC game that is as much fun as any AC has been since Brotherhood or Black Flag. I have played every main AC game, and completed them all, except for AC3 (which was a debacle) and Liberation, which I just lost interest in.\n1868 London (and a quick jaunt to 1916!) is a wonderful place to explore. Sure, it's really a Dickensian nightmare, but it feels so real! I really did feel like I was walking through a living city, something I haven't felt since Revelations' Constantinople. The city is the sort of place you want to just wander around and look at! Trafalgar Square, the Tower, Piccadilly Circus, Parliament; all of these are places to go and marvel at!\nThe gameplay is likewise fantastic. The fighting is as fluid as it's ever been, and despite having all the same AC fighting issues as the rest of the series, it's still a blast to fight your way through a group of Templars. My only complaint is that choosing your fist as a weapon has been removed from the engine. That means those poor Bobbies are getting gutted just for doing their job. It's not as bad as the bar \"fight\" from Unity, but a lack of a fist option seems silly, when really, sometimes you just want to knock the guy down.\nThe only real gameplay issue I have is the carriage driving. Apparently, horses in Victorian London were pretty damned tough! I can race down the sidewalk in a carriage, knocking over iron-lamp posts with impunity, and the horses are cool with that. There are only a few missions requiring the use of a carriage, and I despised them all. Thankfully, they're quickly done, and mostly easy.\nI am 50 hours into this game. I've completed the main storyline, the Queen Victoria missions you get after that, and am now in the midst of the 1916 missions. The 1916 mission, set in and around Tower bridge, are probably several hours worth of play, on their own, and a fascinating look into the death of the Victorian/Edwardian world.\nAnd you know what? There's more to come. The Last Maharajah missions are coming, and the Jack the Ripper DLC.\nI spent $120cdn on this game. I can honestly say, I have not spent money this well on a game in many, many years!

But aside from that, the actual gameplay is improved, specifically with stealth and traversal. Botching a stealth kill doesn't automatically alert everyone and their mother within a 20 mile radius, and the zipline lets you avoid having to ponderously pick your way up every single building facade if you don't want to. Furthermore, each sidequest can be completed through a number of different methods, and there's not an overwhelming amount of stupid collectibles. And while the story itself is merely okay, the characters you meet and play as are all pretty charming and even legit funny.

It's important, yes, yes it is.\nI loved Assassin's Creed, ever since the first game, the one where you play as the weird monkey, I mean monk, Altair. You climb from building to building, start beating up people, stabbing them, jumping around, the bread and butter formula of Assassin's Creed.\nAssassin's Creed 2 took this system to a whole new level, with the introduction of Ezio, whom in my opinion, is still the best character in the entire series. Then came Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Liberation, etc etc, it's all the same formula with slightly different changes per game. For instance, the Twin Blades in AC2, the Hookblade in Revelations, and the usage of recruits in Brotherhood.\nThe series, was awesome.\nHOWEVER, the Assassin's Creed did get plagued by several things, but mainly, Uplay, or as I'd like to call it, U\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665play. It's horrible, AC2 was \"DRM-ed\" with having a constant connection to the servers, only problem being was that the servers happily cut off connection every 10 seconds, causing you to get booted from AC2.\nANYWAY. After that massive screw over by Ubisoft with Unity, I decided to boycott the entire series. Microtransactions? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 performances even on my GTX970? Yeah, I was done with the AC series. Till Syndicate had a 40% sale, and I figured, hey let's give this game another chance!\nAnd I'm glad I did, for the first few hours anyway.\nLet's talk about Graphics.\nIt's amazing, it's beautiful, and London is one huge city to explore. Most importantly, it runs on Ultra settings with my 970, something Unity failed to do even with 4x Titan Xs. Yeah, the optimization for this game is nicely done (after two weeks anyway).\nNow moving on to Gameplay..\nIt's typical Assassin's Creed, you jump, you fly, you go left and right, you stab people. Except now, they make you choose between a stealth character or a brawling character. Some like the AC combat system, I personal prefer the stealth elements. Both characters share the same EXP pool, so you can switch between them as and when you like.\nBy the way, controls are dumb-ed down, you just hold one button to fly across the map. There's no elements such as  near fall, or any other more complicated buttons to press for that matter. It's literally a babi-ed Assassin's Creed, there's no more complexity that the older games delivered.\nHow about the story?\nIt's, once again, a typical Assassin's Creed story. Assassin's trying to over throw Templars. It's been the same thing since the first game. Although I do hate the inturruptions between the real world and the London world, YES THAT ANNOYING MID SEQUENCE THING IS STILL THERE. Why didn't they bring back the Black Flag system beats me, it worked.\nAudio?\nThe music is medicore at most, upon launching most AC games, you'll instantly get drawn to the menu music. Personally, I felt that Syndicate's music is a lot weaker compared to the other AC games. AC1's Credits Song, AC2's Venice Rooftops, AC:B Master Assassin and even AC3's Main Theme, all of these had a lasting impact on the player because of the nature of the piece. Sadly, Syndicate's music doesn't deliver that tier, the music is good, but it won't stick with you.\nMultiplayer?\nFirst Unity removed the AMAZING multiplayer experience started by Brotherhood. Gone were the days where you tried to assassinate another Assassin while at the same time, running away from your own Assassin / Templar.\nThey threw in Co-Op instead\nThen Syndicate removed Co-Op.\nYep.\nWhat Multiplayer?\nWhat about the microtransactions in this game?\nFk off Ubisoft.\nThis is a slight Yes to recommending this game since it IS Assassin's Creed, and it IS fun for a while (at least).\nPros\n- Not Unity\n- It's a DECENT Assassin's Creed\n- The story is alright\n- Game is really, really well optimized\n- It's Not Unity\n- Did I mention it's not Unity?\nCons\n- Micro\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665transactions\n- Dumb-ed down controls\n- Medicore Soundtrack\n- No Multiplayer\n- Did I mention Micro\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665transactions?", "hours": 15.0, "username": "InAmberClad - Idle", "products": 2273, "found_funny": 146, "early_access": false}

Syndicate is a brilliant Assassin's Creed experience, though it leaves something to be desired. First of all, they really did a fantastic job dropping everything that was tedious and broken in Unity. The activities are fun and not time consuming or draining. Collectables are actually useful and most things you find just while playing so there'd no need to go running off too often specifically looking to get collectables that do absolutely nothing to improve your character.\nSpeaking of characters, they are very well written, at least the dynamic assassin duo that are the Frye twins. If you're worried about another Arno, you know the guy who followed the creed the the T and refused to be practical and sensible when feeling and emotions got involved, worry not because the Frye's are the exact opposite. They have some great, interesting dialogue written for them and they do not grow stale or predictable. I especially loved the way Evie became more and more of abadass as you used her more. I was actually torn between who to take out in the open world at times because they're both equally powerful characters in their own ways.\nThe world is stunning! London is captured in the usual Ubisoft splendour, that is to say no detail is left out and everything is meticulously rendered as it would have looked in this 1800s industrial powerhouse. Carriage combat is fun and an extremely quick, and often more reliable method of transport. Coupled with the addition of the grapling hook, you'll find yourself preferring to zoom across the city in minutes rather than fast traveling in favour of taking in the sights.\nNow, the only negative thing I have to add to this already lengthy, rambly review is that the villians really pulled the short stick this time around. It's been some time since Ubisoft has produced a game with did all four of the big ones well, that is combat, 'protagonists', 'antagonists', and worldspace. This game is no exception because as you might of noticed, the only thing I haven't praised yet are the antagonists, the good old Templar Order we know and love. In this game you're introduced to the great Templar Order's English Rite, said to be the most powerful, influential, and oldest sect of their ancient empire. Naturally, you expect their leader Crawford Starrick, to appropriately radiate the amout of power, cunning, and intellect required of someone in charge of such a gem. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Starrick is an interesting villian in his own right, however he is very much a cliche comic book, bond villian. I won't get into too much detail but let's just say chasing after this man isn't as thrilling and exciting as I'd have liked from an AC game, and after finishing the main story ark, I find myself wanting more from this villian who had so much more potential.\nAll in all, I put in a nice chunk of time into this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. With a pretty interesting cliff-hanger I'm more than excited about next year's entry where the modern day is sure to be back in full force!", "hours": 72.6, "username": "Chairman_", "products": 195, "early_access": false}

Unfortunately, the game will not tolerate this, and will outright CHEAT to keep you from victory. In fact, I was doing a child liberation in Westminster at level 8, and the game, among other things, automatically had me leap out of my cover, disabled Chameleon, and, by far the worst part, took away all my smoke bombs and medicine during the middle, without me even using them.\n-Helix credits need to be bought. That is all.\n-Manual aiming is disabled during combat, and non-manual aiming (Via the keyboard) is unresponsive a lot of the time.\n-Enemies are QUICKER than you. You, a trained master assassin, WILL be beaten by lowly Blighters because when you press your counter, the game instead carries through with attacks, especially with high-level enemies.\n-Charles Dickens' storyline has no proper resolution.

Combat has been made easier since Unity which opens up the possibility of going in guns blazing or picking one of the other methods.

That was something from Unity that I was glad Ubisoft kept, it's a great mechanic.\nThe ending was a let-down, but I don't think it could have outdone the ending in Unity.\nAll in all, I wish I could unplay this game just to play it again for the first time.

The story is more developed than the last few AC games, and the different parts and actors around the city map are nicely tied together into the 1870's theme. Victorian London fits the AC fmechanics like a glove.\n--The movement/fighting mechanics are the same as what you're used to. Nothing new to learn.\n--New side activities that can be done and repeated over and over at any time which help to earn money and level-up skills quickly. This includes boxing, carriage racing, hijacking supplies, destroying cargo, robbing trains, and a few others.\n--Good character development and voice acting. It's easy to like the characters you'll be playing.\n--Familiar historical figures to interact with.\n--Trains and trains stations.\n--A much needed grappling hook gun to make getting around easier and faster.\n--This takes place in Victorian London and it actually looks like Victorian London.\n--A good number of outfits and upgradeable gear to choose from\nEven without turning on the game breaking highest of the high super graphics settings, the game still looks pretty good. You play as either the sibling male or female characters Jacob and Evie Frye, mostly choosing which one you want at any given time - though there are a number of missions where you don't have a choice. Jacob is more of a witty brawler and Evie is methodical stealth, though if your a casual gamer it won't make much difference to your play style. You'll end up playing the one you like to look at and listen to the most and still come away satisfied that you haven't missed anything.\nUnlike AC3 which lacked a bit in the city department, London feels fully stocked and without filler buildings that are obviously fillers, and it has plenty of decent options of moving around the map how you choose other than fast travel. The addition of a Spiderman-like grappeling hook gun found in the main story is very easy to use and a welcome time saver to teadiously climbing up tall buildings to try and overcome the distance of running everywhere.\nThere's plenty of prompts as you move about and fight to indicate what's going on, what you can do, and where to go. You won't waste those few precious hours of free time after work each night just trying to figure out what the game wants from you.\nSome historical figures are thrown in and offer some side missions. They feel more like extended cameos than necessary content, but it's a nice diversion if you need one. Ubisoft's political and ideological slants are there as always, but it could have been much worse. The little jabs they take are mostly in the written text content of the collectables menus and not in the spoken character dialouge.\nYou main base is on wheels - a train - and it's constantly moving aorund the city. You can fast travel to it whenever you want.  The trains and carriages around town are a really nice change to the series. If you're feeling adventurous you can easily hijack a carriage, pull up next to an enemy carriage, shift to the roof of it, and jump around between the two vehicles as you duke it out with the bad guy. There's a number of little fast paced Hollywood bits like this to keep it interesting, but you can take it or leave depending on how you feel.\nThe map is divided into boroughs which you conquer like previous AC games. Do all the side pieces (takeover a stronghold, rescue people, etc) and you'll finish up with a gang war to take to borough. You'll fight the goons in the boss fight and then take on the boss, but you have the choice of taking the boss out before the final gang war which makes it easier on you.They progress in difficulty, and if you do even just a few or the varied side missions and activites a number of times (particularly the boxing ring) you'll earn decent money and level up at a rate that fits the story as you play it, allowing you to stay just a little bit stronger than your next objective.\nI was worried about stability, but I didn't find any major bugs or game breaking problems. I know this has been a problem for some people.\nPeople have rightly pointed out that Ubisoft seems to have dumbed the difficulty down, but for the casual gamer who enjoys the AC franchise, there's a lot here to keep you happy.", "hours": 45.3, "user_id": "76561197966661134", "username": "robertkulbeth", "products": 207, "early_access": false}

I was really glad when Ubisoft decided to retain the \"Unique Kill\" mini-requirements, allowing some more cool looking assassination cut-scenes if you know what you're doing, as well as allowing the player to just forego them and go with another strategy. (Just in case you might want to just directly head to the traget or just outright distch stealth and go kill everyone in the target area.) Although, the return of the \"optional objectives\" is still a majestic pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nSecond, the battle system. The ever so powerful counter attacks combined with the new, powerful spammable stun attack makes things pretty easy, with only the fast pace of the fights being the only challenge, as you will still have to time your counters, stuns, and combos.\nThird, the story. Ubisoft finally improved from their previous hijinks with Unity, and made gold material with Syndicate's story. That said, you might want to buy the game yourself if you ever want to find out, as I do not want to throw around spoilers like misplaced christmas gifts.\nFourth, the level grinding. Just go find a fight club around levels 5-8, keep winning it, and you'll reach level 10 in no time.

The zipline fix for the weak parkour is only useful to go up a building, rather than crossing over building to building which is just bad. It is slow and clunky.\nNow onto the story and characters. They're bad. The present is pretty much missing so far from my playthrough (I'm on Sequence 6 [last mission] of 9 and have only seen I think 4 cut scenes that are only a few minutes long) Ubisoft seems to be trying to fire back at the SJWs and saying \"see. we're equal\" by having a male and female character, but if you think about what is said about the characters and look at what they're doing the characters are confused with each other, don't grow, and overall defocus, but if you take into account both the story that we see and the mechanics what you'll see is that the developers over-compensated and gave Evie more brutal finishers, more of a variety of finishers, a love interest, a possible one, while her activities in the past are what are important to those in the present. Further the Mary Sue qualities mixed with them ripping on Jacob which are idiotic because they're not thought out (which is doubly bad since that is the criticism evie has of Jacob) which ends up saying things that tries to make the player sympathetic to horrible things/people or just does make sense when you're looking at what is actually happening.\nUbisoft, overall, did a diservice to the franchise in whatever their goal was. It runs and looks better than Unity which isn't hard, but that probably as a lot more to do with its stripped down nature than anything they did special while the option to switch between Evie and Jacob might seem appealing it makes little sense in the game world and all elements of the game would have been better, by how much I don't know, if they cut Jacob out as a playable character, transfered his missions to Evie, and cut all of the \"Clean up Jacob's mess\" missions.\nI reccomend to get this game if you really want to see what's happening in the universe or want another map for AC stuff, but considering it isn't numbered and isn't a main series title, and can be said to be fairly lacking I say give it a pass if you're looking for inovation, cleaner mechanics, a good story, because they're not here... If you're new to the series I recommend getting an earlier game rather than this one, but if you want to start here it is neither a great nor terrible experience... just not worth $60 imo for what they did and a sub-par entry overall in the series.", "hours": 61.1, "user_id": "76561198015359393", "username": "Durakken", "products": 124, "early_access": false}

Why not, is really fun and engaging. The twins, though their history/origins a bit... rushed over, are genuinely likeable if you alow yourself to try.

Many of the sequences in the game felt anti climatic towards there position in the game and I believe that some of the characters that were introduced into the game like Miss Nightingale only came into the game about 3 or 4 times depending on your mission agenda. The voice acting on the other hand was much like assassin creed revelations. It was outstanding and I felt the need to really care about Evie and Jacob Frye. I grew attached to the twins and I do hope that the next Assassin Creed game will bring in a new Dynamic of displaying two assassins.

Last year I gave a very heated and long review to the terrible game Assassins Creed Unity, and this year I will be giving a review of Syndicate. I had so much hype for Unity and almost none for Syndicate, I almost didn't buy it. So you can imagine my astonishment when I found out it was an extrodinary game. It gave me everything I wanted from an Assassins Creed game and more. It's so insanely fun, with a suprisingly long story and a giagantic map that I promise you'll get lost in. I just completed the campaign (no spoilers) and it was awesome. It wasn't anything extrodinary but the plot was, I would put it \"very good\" not amazing. You get so used to the rope launchers and the horse drawn carriages that you forget what the other AC's were like with out them. In fact, I just closed out of Black Flag and Unity to see how it felt in comparison. Terrible. The answer is terrible, it feels terrible to not have the equipment that you do in Syndicate. The combat was awesome, it was fluid, hard but not ridiculously hard, this time you can actually dodge bullets instead of just  being a meat sheild (looking at you Unity) and the weapons are so creative. Your fists, which are actually really fun to play with and they have awesome new takedown animations for, the cane sword which is pretty badass just from the name alone, and then, my personal favorite was the Kukri knife, which ended up being something I played with almost the entire game. Even after finishing this game, I feel like I've  barely scratched the surface, you can conquor burrows of London, which is something I did within the first 3 hours, but trust me, it doesn't feel rushed or short or anything. Even when there aren't any missions you can go to my personally favorite burrow, the Thames and run from ship to ship blowing them up! Get this game, you really should. It gave me everything I wanted from ACU.

The cloak is locked to 30 FPS regardless of what you do and it does not support SLI. It may say it supports SLI but it doesn't. Only like 10% of your additional GPU(s) will be used, if any at all.\nThe game is an Assassin's Creed simulator, not anything like the previous epic stories of Ezio and Alta\u00efr. Jacob and Evie are interesting characters but with little to offer overall. Initially you're forced to put different skills into the skill tree for each of the two characters, but eventually you'll have all the skills (potentially before reaching 40% of game completion) except for the ones locked to each character.\nThe NPCs in the game are a lot better, and it makes a good impression of creating a lively and vibrant world.

It became my favorite Ubi game, and in my opinion the best of AC yet. Beautiful, immersive, vivid Victorian London that's very fun to explore with more polished mechanics and some new elements thrown into the mix. I must also mention the game's great voice acting, and its sublime soundtrack, contributing to the setting's appeal. The side activities are entertaining, and its combat feels smooth and very satisfying, with both protagonists. Despite each other's different strengths and their showcased individuality, both Evie and Jacob are fun to play as, and their skills are yours to select. Evie is without a doubt the more compelling of the two as a well-written protagonist, and her calculated stealthy style really suits her and her path towards her endgame goals. The twins' dynamic, however, mostly stemming from their differences, is very fun to watch.\nGiven Ubi's past mistakes, perhaps the most pleasant surprise about ACS is that its PC version does not disappoint - not only it looks gorgeous, but it's one of the best I've played this year; some hiccups here and there - minor things that patches will certainly take care of soon, but overall optimized and runs well within one's hardware limits, and I have a mid-range rig.\nA fun game with a refreshing choice in protagonists, moderately intriguing main storylines with a few history icons as associates, and a rich setting that can easily draw you in with its stunning sights and enjoyable activities.

At first the combat felt a bit \"spammy\" since you do have to mash attack a lot, but you also have to mix in stuns and dodges.\nThe parkour has been changed a bit too, you can now \"freerun down\" meaning that instead of leaping out towards whatever ledge may or may not be reachable, you jump or climb down the side of whatever you're on. This is something I didn't even really realize the game needed, but it is an awesome change.\nThe story uses two characters, the Frye Twins that you can freely switch between when in the open world but for missions it will force you to play as one of them, some of the main missions force you to play as both of them as they simoltaneously do different parts of the same mission. I think the whole character swapping thing is a cool idea but it feels forced, like they included that feature just for the sake of having it rather than it being core to the gameplay.\nOverall this is a solid game that runs really well (i5 4440, GTX 980, 8GB RAM) on all but maxed settings, as usual, the Nvidia game(doesn't)works stuff murders your framerate (having all the nvidia stuff turned on will eat a solid ~15 fps if not more) but with those turned off it runs great and still looks good.\nSeems like between Unity and the even bigger \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665how that was Arkham Knight Ubisoft finally realized how to make a good PC port.", "hours": 9.0, "username": "Garenator", "products": 204, "early_access": false}

Set within London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution, the story follows twins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organized crime during the Victorian era and fight against the established order, controlled by the Templars. The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing new traveling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics.\nUnlike its direct predecessors but like the first two main games in the series, Syndicate does not feature any multiplayer gameplay. Assassin's Creed Syndicate marks the first time in the series where you can freely switch between two different protagonists. It is also the first main entry in the series to feature a playable female protagonist. Male lead Jacob Frye is meant to be more of a hot-headed brawler, specialized in close combat, while his twin sister Evie is strong in stealth and relies on her intelligence and wit.\nThe Assassins' main weapons this time around include brass knuckles, a compact revolver, a cane sword and the traditional Nepalese curved kukri knife and combat is faster-paced than before. Additionally new travelling systems make their debut in the game, such as a rope launcher which allows the you to rappel up structures as well as create a zip-line between buildings, and carriages, which can all be piloted or simply occupied by you, and trains. London in the game is approximately 30% larger than Paris in Unity and consist of seven boroughs: Westminster, the Strand, the City of London, Whitechapel, the Thames, Southwark and Lambeth.\nOverall I think Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a massive improvement and perhaps the best AC game since AC II not just because of the gameplay and the story, but also the port. It runs very smoothly and the graphics are just beautiful, I suggest you play around with the settings to get the best performance possible. It hardly has any game breaking bugs or glitches that can prevent you from being able to complete certain missions.

The only reason it existed is because Ubisoft Montreal got a excellent feedback about Sea battle in AC3 and they found they have no fresh idea anymore so they just improved sea battle and re-released it as AC Black Flag, seriously it should never be considered as a formal AC game because the Assassin orgnization in that game in beyound ignorant. By the way I enjoy sea battle just as much as you do, but they should not add it into AC because assassin is not pirate and Black flag is a total failure.", "hours": 29.3, "user_id": "76561198058257532", "username": "DrUnfaithful", "products": 249, "early_access": false}

There are no more swords. Not a lot of customization to the characters compared to the rest of the games. There was even an option to buy IG money. THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME WHY DO I NEED TO BUY MONEY. :l\n~Edit~\nSince quite a few people actually took a look at my review I feel like I should explain a bit more as to what I stated above.\n-Regarding the backstory for the characters, it just felt very rushed compared to other AC games. You jump right into the action with both characters, and with previous AC games, it was not like that whatsoever. Some people might've liked this fast pace change, and I'm sure (maybe) that you learned a bit more about the characters throughout the game, but in my -short- time of playing, I only got a taste of there witty banter towards each other and others.\n-I should also throw in, whilst it does say that the two characters have preferred roles (one a brawler and the other more stealth oriented), I didn't feel that difference at all.\n-On weapons and equipment, it makes complete sense (excluding the obvious assassin equipment) for the time period. Ubisoft did a good job with that. It's just that the combat with the weapons given to us were just unimpressive, again, compared to the previous AC games. I'm an assassin with access to a vast amount of weapons, so why are my only options a khukri, a cane sword, and some gauntlets? The additions of having a pistol wasn't that bad, however.\n-There was a severe lacking of outfits that you could obtain (comparing it from the last game), but I guess something to keep in mind is that you're also playing with two characters. Managing both of the characters loadouts just became ennoying. Now, you can purchase some more outfits as a DLC... :l\n-I think the fact that Ubisoft has a feature to buy IG money (I don't know if this has changed) is a bit poor, considering that this is a singleplayer game.\nDo I recommend this game at full price? No. Do I recommend it if it ever goes on sale? Yes.\nBecause whilst I do address some issues about this game, Ubisoft really tried and suceeded to give us a better game from AC Unity. It still feels like an AC game. The combat is still fun. (it however felt better in Unity, refer to my statement about weapons). It still has -some- interesting story to get invested in. It's an alright game. I'd like to say I interested to see what Ubisoft has in store for us for the franchise in the future, but I'd rather much prefer that they take there time on the next one.

Another thing, you have the option to take the game seriously or not, and really, although the missions are fun, and the stealth is really cool, fooling around rammin into people is of course just silly entertainment, so don't be scared to sidetrack and goof around a bit.

Hell yeah, it's good.  But I mean, it's like a solid 75/100.\nWhat's good?  Well, the setting is done pretty well.  The main villain is interesting, and there's no more of that annoying modern day gameplay (at least so far in my playthrough).  I'm enjoying the story, such as it is.\nNow for the bad: the freerunning is messy as hell.  I was trying to climb down from a crate, using only the button that is -expressly for descending -, and I just kind of kept hopping off and then on to one ledge.  I mean, it's pretty bad.  Your \"stronghold\" (since every AC game needs one of those, evidently) is a train this time around, which is a cool idea in theory, but in practice it just means that you have to figure out where on the map your stronghold is at any given time (did I mention it moves?), and figure out how to intercept it.  The train is probably the absolute worst thing about this game, and it was intentional.  I mean, not intentionally bad, but you know...it's working as designed, it's just that the design is awful.  A bunch of missions can only be done from the train, too, which makes that especially annoying.  NPC's glitch out all the time.  I had one glitch where I just had an enemy that kept respawning around this one corner.  I farmed about 70 of them before I got bored and found something else to do.  I also regularly see children diving off of ledges, sometimes several stories up.  While I mentioned that the bad guy is pretty cool and interesting, he's also not nearly utilized enough.  I'd have preferred something like the amount of characterization we got with Haytham back in AC3, which was one of the few story-related things that game got right.\nThe combat is....Assassin's creed.  You don't play this series for the combat.  If a good combat system is what you want, then I have no idea why you would even play this.\nI mean, I know it sounds like a lot more bad than good, but I'm enjoying it.  I'd recommend it.

They are all connected to your progress and the main story, you don't feel like doing missions that aren't connected to the main goal of the game. The side missions actually make a lot of sense now. \"Hey let's liberate London, but before that, imma do 25 hours of weird activites that aren't connected to anything of my main task\" This statement now is wrong and I salute you Ubisoft, thanks for that.\n+Funny. Yes, Jacob and his sister are actually funny.\n+Switching characters. I like that we now can switch between two Assassin's. This seems to have future.\n+Parkour. It's fluid and fun, and the rope launcher adds even more fun, provides new opportunities for assassinations and ambushes. Well done Ubi.\n+Whistling. Yes, it's back. Either Arno was too dumb to whistle or he simply forgot that he can use his mouth to make noises.\n+Overall combat stealth comination.

I have a GTX 950, so not that beefy of a GPU, but I was able to run this game smoothly with medium settings, and the game still looked great. Often with games the lower settings always ended up being significantly uglier, but this game is still quite the looker even in medium graphic settings. I had around 60-30 FPS while playing, and it never dropped below 30, even in the denser areas. Mostly stayed around 60 to 50, which was totally fine for me and gave me a smooth enough experience.\nWhat also gave me a pleasant surprise was the gameplay itself. With AC games I usually get bored within the first hour or so, but I can tell I'm going to be investing a lot of time into this game, because it's such a fresh new take on the AC franchise. I'm obsessed with the stealth system this time around, especially since I've always found the stealth aspect in the AC games to be lackluster, ironically. And the combat is so much more fluid and fun.\nEven the characters I already like. Evie and Jacob each have their own personalities, so they're not just wooden planks like whoever was the name of that main character from Unity.\nI was strongly against buying this game at first, but now I honestly don't regret doing so.

The melee combat is much faster paced and the takedowns are incredibly over the top, I bashed a guy in the head with a cane and he did a full flip and then I hit him again to kill him, they're cool looking none the less but it's a little too over the top at times.\nJacob and Evie are probably my all time favorite protagonist's out of all AC games, I played Rogue and I felt that Shay was an amazing character to play as but running around as Jacob or Evie is much more enjoyable this time around.\nThe customization is nicely done, they still offer micro transactions like they did in Unity but it feels much less forced now, I've been able to quickly get the equipment I want by just playing the game the way I want to, I don't feel forced to buy a package of in game money so I can upgrade my weapon. So that's good!\nOne thing that bothers me is the lack of inventory and equipment, you're only able to equip your weapon in full combat as well as the hidden blade which really bothers me, the whole point of the cane sword is to have a weapon concealed in an average cane but you don't even get to see it! You fight someone and then you take the cane out of your coat pocket and then put it back in after the fight is over, I would like to be able to walk around with the cane hanging out in my hands like in the screenshots but nope.

It plays like Unity.\nI'm writing from Memory 04, which so far has given me the game's hookshot tool, but hasn't given me more than a glimpse at the piece of Eden or whatever it is they've insisted is For Great History this time around.  The hookshot is actually pretty cool.\nWe now have skill trees, which I'd feel inclined to roll my eyes at, except it really does instill this feeling of growth, that your character(s) are going from rookies to experts.  I'm not sure I care for the progression though, as it's kind of convoluted with levels.  Could've just done skills, I think, and the gear you can find/craft is available by level, which is frustratingly artificial.\nWe do not have ships.  I feel like one of the very few who liked the ships, so it bears mention and is probably a pro to most players.  And hiring your gangthugs is kind of unintuitive - they aren't very smart and will spoil their share of mission objectives by killing foes or running jack-stupid through an enemy base you're trying to infiltrate.  Without the gang, most the game's various areas feel pretty cool (and are surprisingly not ruined by the Hookshot, as was my other fear).\nCharacter switching is unexpectedly disappointing.  You have to go into the pause menu and arbitrarily tap some key, to see the portrait change.  It then dumps you from the start menu (even if I'm just trying to buy the other character some skill or gear),\nit will tell you with no explanation that you can't switch to this character right now.  GTAV did this better, and seemingly without effort.  And they're supposedly meant to be different by having separated end-game skills but to be honest I can barely see the difference when I'm\nto find it.  In the narrative sequences I find myself liking the characters, but I still feel like this was a gimmicky response to some meaningless criticism I never bothered to look into.  \"We want to play\ngenders!\" just isn't something I can imagine rational people belting out that often.\nSpeaking of GTAV, the horse-drawn carriages are okay.  They're the thinnest replacement for cars I've ever played - I mean, you can even crash and ram things with your horses and literally you can take your coach in reverse.  It's a car.\nAlso returning from Unity is Ubisoft's\n, allowing us to fork over yet more cash in order to suffer less of a grind.  None of that's necessary - you can operate just as well without forking over that cash, just with slower progression.\nAnd while I just can't believe I'm saying this, since I abhor most online game crowds and implementations,\n.  I think they should've included it but, I guess there wasn't much payoff.  All those little club activities were pretty lame, but the rest of it was ridiculously fun, and satisfied my vanity of being a ninja and running around on top of buildings like it ain't no thang.  Now I can only do that from the solitude of my keyboard.\nAll around, this game probably won't unseat other AC entries from being your favorite, but it isn't lacking of much that we've come to expect.  If you're trying to hold off on buying this, you\nbecause at this stage, our Season Cashtickets aren't worth anything and Ubi still has to smooth out some of its launch flaws.  (A few of the missions so far have very clearly\nbeen playtested, and these usually get fixed in the first couple months if I recall.)\nAnd if you're new to Assassin's Creed, go ahead and buy an earlier, cheaper entry into the franchise to see if you like it as much as those youtube videos.  Most of these games, being annual episodes of a not-quite-cohesive storyline, are pretty similar to one another by now.  Unimaginative purists will shriek about their sacred assassins not being pirates, but basically if you like pirates I recommend Black Flag.  If you like not-pirates, I recommend Unity.  And if Unity's not cheap enough, I still have a soft spot for AC2 / Brotherhood, but just note that those are pretty dated titles.", "hours": 51.6, "username": "Shria Abuffe", "products": 330, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

I am running the game on max settings (except PCSS Ultra and HBAO+ Ultra) on a desktop with an Intel i7 CPU, NVIDIA 980 GPU (4GB), and 16GB RAM, with pretty stable 60FPS.\nThe main characters in Assassin's Creed Syndicate are fantastic! I absolutely love their personalities, and they are defiantly competitors to the character we all know and love, Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Jacob and Evie Frye have a houmoristic and great relationship, which makes it fun to watch every cut-scene.\nThe gameplay is something different from the other Assassin's Creed games, but I like it. It is nice too see that Ubisoft take chances by changing the gameplay of the series, which makes it more fun for us to play the new game. Ubisoft has taken a step away from the usage of swords in combat, which makes the combat in this game feel fresh and new. They have also added the new \"hookshot\", which gives the game an even more fresh feeling, bcs it gives you a new way of traveling around.\nI could write about this game the whole day, but I think you guys get the point by now.

Thank you ubisoft for actually listening to feedback and putting an effort into a PC Title you deserve my dollar for this one and i hope the rest of your upcoming titles have the same effort put into them.\nPros:\n-The story starts off with abstergo but so far i have played it, all the abstergo\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665that nearly made me die of boredom in previous titles is all cutscenes that dont take long and puts you straight into Jacob and Evies shoes right afterwards. No 4 hour long origin story which takes 7 chapters just to start wearing the assassin gear.\n-Very good textures and Lighting (occassional render pop ins and low res textures however it is open world and the scale of the world makes up for it)\n- Performance is solid (GTX 980 - I7 4790k - 8GB RAM) i run it on ultra highs besides having PCSS off and using base high shadows, HBAO + and not ultra, and TXAA x2. it seems the main performance eaters are the gameworks options so i have to turn them down a little or have them completly off like PCSS because it isnt worth the fps drop\n-Setting is amazing i really enjoy seeing London packed full of carriages, trains and people everywhere in a packed enviroment with tall buildings all close together.\n-Even the music just fills the game with more charm and goes well with the setting (Im from England so minor bias here)\n-Characters are so much better than in some recent AC games in my opinion with obvious weaknesses and strengths and just overall charm in cutscenes\n-Combat feels more fast paced and more challenging than previous titles where enemies seem more agressive and can block at any time. No more counter spam and then just LMB to kill everything which got boring as hell eventually\n-Customisation feels solid with many tiers of items like belts, capes, outfits, colours, gear, firearms and weapons to change with and upgrade\n-Zipline is a great addition and saves time and hassle but also is awesome to use when you jump into a carriage or assassinate people from it\nCons:\n-Really jarring low fps cloth textures like on jackets or capes of your character which i hope can be fixed with a patch because it is noticable\n-Cannot change motion blur in setting, when you use the carriage or zipline there is a huge amount of motion blur\n-You only get 3 choices of main weapons: Kukri, Cane, Knuckle Dusters. There are lots of variations but i would have liked to see maybe two handed weapons or just swords and other kinds of knifes for example\n- To follow on from that ^ would have liked to have the options of rifles instead of just a pistol, enemies use them however you cannot pick them up off of dead enemies\nOverall im pleased Ubisoft have paid attention to their mistakes and feedback and have changed for the better. i would say for the effort into putting out a solid port for PC and it is quite a fun, charming game on top of that it deserves a buy. I understand skeptisism because its ubisoft and i hated what they did last year but if they carry on like this i hope they earn the trust they once had back because they have proved they can make a solid title in what was a very terminal series.", "hours": 7.0, "username": "Hutch", "products": 351, "early_access": false}

Syndicate takes Assasins creed to the next level, because the choices you make in combat does matter, and you can indeed end up dead if you choose wrong.\nThe Graphics are ok. Just like any other assasins creed game, i dont really see a big difference in graphics, but hey, that might just be me being stupid.

I am also getting a lot of loading lag spikes whilst driving a carriage, but i dont really prefer the carriage so it does not matter to me.\nI will for sure finish the campaign and try to master the combat system so i can have some fun, but i dont see myself playing a lot of hours after the main story.\nSo as an assasins creed fan, is it worth buying?\nYes it is. You can for sure get a lot of hours of fun gameplay and interesting Main quests.\nSo is it worth getting today? Should i pay the full price?\nI would say no.

The game itself feels like a step forward in terms of art design and the way it handles side quests. Opening up a map doesn't seem overwhelming anymore. You just have 5 or 6 clear objectives in every section of the map. It's not 1000+ little collectibles marked all over. The pacing is on point. The story is also quite good so far, I especially love the skill tree added in. Gameplay wise it seems to be a step back. Unity went for a more open ended mission structure (Syndicate could still go this way considering how early into the game I'm in) where you were given a target and a general location and all you had to do was figure out a way to kill the target. This one seems to lead you down a direct path to your targets leaving little creativity to how you dispose of targets (So AC1-4 style). It also feels like the combat is a step back. It's a counter fest again. So if you're down with the old gameplay style for another entry then it's fine.

The GPU load will often go between 80% and 90% but so far no area (regardless of what was happening on the screen or the weather) made the fps dip under 60. I have no idea if this scales down to lower end cards very well or not, but for my particular use case I'm not dissapointed (the game looks the part for what it's squeezing out of the graphics card). I will duck points for the top tier features nuking the performance though, and lack of more lightweight AA options such as SMAA. A choice between FXAA and 2xMSAA+FXAA is hardly a choice. Bugs and glitches have basically been nonexistent (only one graphical bug in 7 hours of playing, a minor one at that and zero gamebraking bugs or anything immersion breaking). Overall I'd rate the technical aspects somewhere along the lines of a 7.5/10 since at the time of writing the physics are locked to 30fps and it really doesn't look good when the rest of the game is running at 60fps. I hope they'll fix that soon.\nGameplay- it's pretty much the most refined AC game I played yet (I haven't played Unity mind you). Traversing London is very enjoyable, the place is huge and I barely scratched the surface of it. The option to play as either Jacob or Evie (save for some character specific missions) is a very nice touch and I like being given a choice here. The combat can actually be hard and you're not an unstopabble killing machine, at least not in the beginning. This makes the upgrades actually meaningful, and as a result the combat gains a lot here. I'd rate it at something along the lines of 9/10\nAudio- Excellent, it really gives almost a tactile feeling to what you're doing in game. The voice actors do a good job (at least from what I can tell) and the music is nice and appropriate.\nOverall I find the game very enjoyable and apart from that 30fps physics lock there have been no technical difficulties that would take away from that enjoyment. It might be that Ubisoft learned from their mistake with Unity and released a better polished product or they just got better in implementing their technology. In any case for what it is now I can without a doubt recomment this game, with just a word of warning that you need a beefy machine to run it.", "hours": 64.8, "username": "BakedCookie", "products": 316, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

I say another because not much has changed from the previous titles.  You get a third-person action-adventure RPG with the same basic fighting skills and controls as any other Assassin's Creed game.  What does Syndicate give you?  A step back on a new engine.\nSyndicate is designed on the same engine as Unity and looks very much the same as Unity did last year only without the poorly opimized gameplay Unity had upon release (fixed four months later).  You get a new gadget to play with early on in the game, the grappling attachment to the assassin's blade.  Syndicate also takes a step back to older styled combat after fans complained that Unity was overly simplified which provides a steeper challenge, especially if you wander into an area a few levels higher.\nI found navagating the city worse than Unity.  Unity for the most part was very decent except trying to jump off a fence or going into a window.  Syndicate's controls with a keyboard and mouse are worse. I can be climbing and trying to shimmy right with the \"D\" key pressed and Jacob shimmys left!  In just over 12 hours of gameplay, I have had this happen several times while trying to navigate support beams under bridges and the train stations.\nAnother area I found disappointing was the lack of stats on gear choices that Unity introduced.  I rather enjoyed having so many options to load my character up with to attempt a stealth vs full on kill everything mission.  Syndicate takes another step back to the quest rewards and crafting gear with very limited options other than those found on outfits.\nOne aspect of Unity I really enjoyed was the Co-Op club activities I played with my 12 year old son.  We had a blast and as a result I have over two hundred hours in Unity which is double what I have in any other AC game and up to 5 times what I have in the older AC titles.  I was very disappointed that the Co-Op club activities were abandoned in Syndicate this time around as I found that to be one of the most redeeming qualities of Unity.\nThe story is good, not great.  It is the familar obtain the pieces of eden at any cost from or before the templars use them to destory the world with corrupt power. The best part of the sotry is that you get to play as two people.  The interaction between the twins (Jacob & Evie) really help to push the story along and make it fun. For the most part you can choose who you want to play with the exception of the story line which will force you to play one or the other at times.\nGraphically Syndicate looks as great as Unity did, maybe just a bit better.  The engine runs smooth although the system requirements are extremely steep.  Running triple SLI with 3x gtx 980s my frame rate will take a hit with everything on max settings but that may be in part due to a lack of sli support.  On a good note, the game still looks great on lower/mid cards such as a gtx 960 on low settings. Syndicate definitely looks better than Unity did on low settings.\nBetter combat\nBetter optimized graphics\nFun interaction between twin characters\nControls are worse\nNo Co-Op club activities\nLimited stats to build your character\nI was very disappointed in the absence of the Co-Op club activities, the poor control issues, and the lack of stats on gear for character custimization.  But in the end Syndicate does provide that very familar AC game experience if not over familar.  Syndicate is ejoyable although do not expect to spend several hundred hours in this title like you may have with AC IV Black Flag, AC Rogue, or AC Unity.

Very enjoyable if you ask me.\nEdit:- I've finished the main story and added more info in story and characters, gameplay and present day  section.\nReview:\n\nAh, everyone's interested in this after Unity fiasco. I can assure you while this is not a super glorious port like Gta V, Mad max or MgsV, this game runs much better and smoother than Unity. My current setup i5 3450, Gtx 660 and 8gb ram. I'm getting 35-45fps in open world with textures set to high, all settings to low, fxaa and vsync is off at 1080p. At same settings I got 20-30fps in Unity and also lots of stuttering, freezes and framedrops which is not very common in Syndicate.\n: turn down gameworks. Pcss ultra is a performance killer which takes like 20-25fps alone compared to high/medium shadows. Hbao+ is kinda ok, but txaa tanks performance as well. Do this and you won't have any problems of having 40fps etc. on 980ti or similar killer rigs.\n\nMy favorite aspect in games in general and my most likable part in this game. The story is quite good but the thing that I love most is the light hearted tone. The interaction of Jacob and Evie are enjoyable to watch as they behave like real brothes and sister. There are a lot of jokes in the game, for example when the last assassin of London(won't spoil his name) says about a templer, \"He is known to vanish before your very eyes\",  Jacob says, \"Shall we make him vanish for real?\" I'm still at sequence 3, so I can't give you impressions about other intricate things but will update the review later. There are lot of interesting historical characters you'll meet. I think you know the names of already from the historical characters trailer of this game.\nEdit:- The story is much, much better than Unity. Although at times, it might feel like something is left to be desired. The ending was quite nice too. I'd love more games on the twins and Henry.\n\nThis is what people always complain about being the same. I can't deny that it does not change much but if that happened it won't remain assassin's creed anymore. In this game the gameplay defining changes include the rope launcher. It's not like just cause's grappling hook. It works like batman's grapple in arkham games except that this one can be used as zipline for building to building traversal as well. It does not take away from parkour but it actually complements in nicely. Great addition, if you ask me.\nCombat system is one of the things that like. It's fast and brutal and feels fun unlike clunky and slow combat of Unity. However to some people, it might feel like button mashing or being too fast. You can't change weapons mid combat. Weapons work like outfits as you have to assign one in inventory. No hidden blade combat is there.\nNow to stealth. Cover system is better than Unity. It's a soft cover system as opposed to Unity's hard cover. The crouching mode and change to hood is considered annoying by some, but I don't mind it. Hoods made sense in AC1 because it was needed to blend in with scholars who also wore hoods. Since then, for once, we are using proper clothing to blend in which actually makes sense.\nCrowd events are present just like Unity. Crowds are thinner. Even though it was done to help the performance, it makes sense historically as there was no revolution in London. So there was no need for people to flock the streets.\nCarriages are a good addition too. Mobile hiding spot, fast way to reach places, a great tool to fight enemies as well. It does not handle perfectly but you will get used to it.\nEdit:- Two switchable characters with 3 unique skills for each really freshens up gameplay. Adds some replayability as well.\nThe assassinations are much enjoyable this time. Each one providing stealth opportunity, assistance opportunity to better infiltrate the targets as well as providing an unique kill option, fulfilling all of its conditions will reward you with a cutscene of the assassination.\nThe modern day story, hated by some people but to me,  it's one of the most important aspects of the series that differentiates it from other open world games and holds the games together. I have both good and bad news for the present day fans. Bad news is, it's still cutscenes only. Good news is, it moves the story foward unlike Unity. There are cutscenes after a number of sequences and they are all action packed unlike Unity where you just listen to Bishop talking. Overall it's enjoyable.\nEdit:- The ending was badass. There is a epic fight scene. The ending left me hyped for ac 2016,  almost a cliffhanger, if you ask me.\nIn my 4 hours in the game, I encountered one glitch. In a cutscene, I got the invisible character glitch, I could hear them talking, feel them moving but except Jacob, the character model of other 2 characters wasn't showing up. And in an another cutscene, I got a framedrop to 10 fps. These are the only issues I faced so far.\n\nIf you are a dedicated fan, definitely buy it. Even with a sub par performance, I'm loving this game. If you are not, then buy it if you have a good mid range righ at least, something like 960 or so. 4gb vram is recommended but not mandatory. The game is really good and enjoyable.

So people with a GTX980 (or lower specs) have to lower some graphic settings.\nMissions and game play are more diverse then the previous AC Unity game. Also being able to play female and male is a nice bonus. Yes you play both :-)\nI did not have any bugs so far, probably there will be some like every game has, but overall nothing to worry about. Make sure latest Graphic card drivers are correctly installed. Better do a clean driver install and let the ingame settings overrule the driver settings.\nHoping this was useful for someone.

We don't need a carbon copy of Ezio, but sadly Ubisoft can't make any other set of characters as interesting as the ones in the Ezio trilogy. They aren't bad but they aren't great either\nBut gameplay-wise? This is where the game truly shines. I haven't experienced this kind of feeling with an AC game since I played AC2 after playing the first one.\nThe game takes the best bits from Unity and makes them better, like the new to the series stealth system, parkour system, customization, skills, and some resemblance to the combat (blocking at the exact time is not important tho, and the combat feels more arcade-button mashing style, way faster than any AC game)\nThe combat may feel clunky at first, but for me it was an acquired taste. The parkour however, feels as fluid as ever and the new grappling hook is a really nice addition in my opinion, and if you don't enjoy it you can avoid it without problem.\nI also think the new missions are designed way better, I have not finished the game yet, but the missions make way more sense, are more interesting and way less repetitive than the first games. No more endless tale missions, there is an immense variety of stuff to do, and every type of mission requires a different aproach, you're not going to try the same thing inside a factory than aboard a boat.\nThe thing is, the stealth is implemented way better in this games than in previous ones, the mission design is more open and interesting and the navigation through the world is fluid, also taking into account the carriages.\nThe game is chaotic and it doesn't take itself too seriously,that is a really fresh change that the franchise needed.\nFor the people like me who likes the modern story, the game is a small step but in the right direction, there are just 10 minutes worth of cinematics, which kind of sucks, but it means that Ubisoft knows that the modern day storyline is necessary to keep a lot of old fans buying the games.\nSo, in the end, it is not the perfect AC game. it has its problems, but the gameplay is really well designed and it really shows that the developers are walking towards the right direction, in a way (if you don't b*tch a lot about every little mistake you might find just for the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 of it) it could be said that this is the return of the franchise...\n(sorry for bad english, not my native language)", "hours": 49.6, "username": "Blueshift", "products": 96, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

The Victorian era is one of my favorite historical settings and AC's London does it justice. Even if the story ends up being terrible (it's fine so far, and has a decent amount of humor to boot), the city is magnificent and I'm really impressed with the number of moving parts--boats, carriages, trains, factory machinery, and so forth.\nImportant note: if you have a graphics card with only 2 GB VRAM (I have a 2 GB Nvidia 960), it might be worth your while to try going over the memory threshold shown on the graphics options screen. When I tried this with GTA V, the game stuttered, but when I try this with AC: Syndicate, the game shrugs and says \"Eh, why not.\" Of course there are limits, but with a little experimentation I was able to get the game to run very smoothly and still show textures that aren't blurry messes (which they are on Low). Maybe Ubisoft sandbagged it a little to avoid a deluge of complaints. Whatever the reason, it's worth fiddling with the settings.\nEdit: Additional technical info: playing at 1920x1080, Intel i7-4790K @ 4 GHz.\nUpdated info after 70 hours: Well, I'm getting close to finishing the story missions and everything I said above still holds. Since I've already said plenty of nice stuff about the game, here I would like to point out a few nitpicks.\nMuted outfit colors: The in-game outfit artwork shows vivid reds and dark blacks, but the actual colors you can use with your outfit are toned down. This is the Victorian era, friends, let us get fancy.\nHelix credits: I don't mind paying for good DLC, but Helix credits seem like a raw deal, particularly since they only buy things that should be covered by difficulty sliders. It's as though you bought a calculator but had to pay extra to use the trig functions. It wouldn't be so bad if you got a lot of them for a couple bucks, I guess, but these prices are eye-popping and jaw-dropping. So I haven't bought any.\nMission glitch: I found one mission (going slumming, literally, with a wealthy lady) would not complete properly for me--the game would freeze with a perpetual \"saving\" icon when the mission ended. It turns out you need to get her home before she stops talking. Easy enough to get around once you look up a workaround on the Internet, but it really should work properly.\nTypefaces: Overall, the typefaces you'll see on in-game signage are what you'd want and expect, but there are a couple signs in there that were apparently designed in Microsoft Word using whatever font was handy, and whenever I see one it's like finding a 1979 penny in my pocket and being rudely yanked back into modernity.\nStill, it's a great game all in all.\nUpdate after 82 hours: There is a really annoying bug on replays of kidnapping and Templar hunting missions: the game may fail the mission immediately after loading it. Then it will reload, and maybe it will work or maybe it will fail again. It seems to load properly eventually, but I've seen it reload 4 or 5 times before working. Annoying. Then again this is the first Assassin's Creed game where I've been motivated to go back and replay missions to complete all the side requirements, so I guess I'll just have to hope they patch it.", "hours": 119.0, "user_id": "76561198066676208", "username": "Gughunter", "products": 343, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "368500", "page": 245, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-11-19", "text": "19 minutes in and it's already what I hoped for in an Assassin's Creed game\nEDIT:\nOkay, so I've become more realistic and actually played more of the game before I posted a review. Here are some of my pros and cons of the game now that I've played it more. I believe this review could really determine your choice on buying this game or not if you'll just stand the length of it. NO MAJOR STORY SPOILERS FOR AC SYNDICATE. I'M SPOILER FREE!!!\nPROS:\n-Gameplay\nThe gameplay by far is a major improvement from any other Assassin's Creed game. Instead of the copy-and-pasted \"run up buildings and stab people\" formula the AC series is used to, Assassin's Creed Syndicate offers more complex combat, parkour, and traversal systems.\n>COMBAT\nCombat has been made easier than Assassin's Creed Unity but not as simple as AC3, as I'm sure many of you should remember. If you have not played any previous AC games, this new combat system will be extremely easy to understand, as it includes having a strategy. A strategy as in \"Should I stun this guy and bring him and his 3 friends for an epic multikill, or quick shoot all of them\" There are many varietys in ways you could bring your enemies down.\n>PARKOUR:\nParkour hasn't changed much from Unity. The Free-Run Up and Down is still an option but the only major change in parkour, and I mean MAJOR change is the Rope Launcher. Ah the rope launcher. The latest hidden blade/gauntlet modification that made you the Batman of the 1800's. Except it doesn't. Unlike the speculation of many, the rope launcher is not directly ripped from the Arkham Games (you wouldn't believe me if I told you many thought this was the case) The Rope-Launcher doesn't zoom you up a building, it's almost like a rappel in which you hop on the sides of the buildings to your destination. This tool has made synchronization easier by lessening the hassle of climbing up those big dome buildings.\n>TRAVERSAL\nWays to travel throughout the massive open world of AC has massively changed. What used to be horses are now carriages, what used to be the Jackdaw is now a huge array of multiple steamboats. I know that's not even extremely close to a good analogy but regardless. Trains and steamboats all follow a path that goes to pretty much where you want it to go. All you have to do is wait. Maybe shoot some Blighters off of their enemy boats, or manage your gear and gang upgrades from you train hideout. Yeah, that's right, a TRAIN hideout. All those other hideouts the Assassin's had, Masyaf, Monteriggioni, the Homestead, an island, and wherever it was you hid in Unity, don't even compare to a TRAIN hideout. Carriages are pretty cut and dry. You hop in them and start riding around. Almost like a horse. Except for the fact that you can fight on the roofs of the carriages and wage battle with uncoming Blighters as they endlessly try to climb the sides to end your life. And then the carriage stops and Blighters and policemen are shooting at you and your stationary cart and climbing the carriage sides, AND trying to gut you while you flick them off like flies. Think of it as a zombie movie. The movies that have the main hero stand atop some rubble and fire all his rounds into a horde of zombies. Cool right?\n-GRAPHICS AND ANIMATIONS\nI've paired these two together so I wouldn't have to make two seperate categories. I don't know the full details of my rig but my gpu as of today is a MSI GTX GeForce 760 2GB. It sucks I know please don't hate. But the thing is, I can play this game on the *VERY HIGH* graphics settings pretty well. I recieve constant 45-50 fps and rarely have massive fps drops. Though once I get at least 2 hours into playing the game I start the drasticaly lose frames. Cutsenses lag and and animations are choppy, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I'M AN STUBBORN LI'L\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665WHO WON'T TURN THE GRAPHICS DOWN BECASUE I HATE FUZZY TEXTURES MAKING ME THINK I'M BLIND!!!! All I have to do though is restart the game and it goes back to normal.  But yeah if you have a nice rig going on, graphics should work great for you. This game has some of the best video game graphics I've seen this year on PC, and I'm not just kissing\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665here. The facial features on the characters, the placement of facial hair, the detail that goes into the outfits and buildings. It's almost like looking at an actual person. This uses the same engine as AC Unity, and I can definetely see some recycled animations from Arno, but hopefully it shouldn't bother you too much. Also the new hood-up and hood-down system, also known as the new Stealth system, has arose some conflict in players saying they want to hood to be toggleable. But there isn't really a difference between Jacob with a hat and Jacob with a hood. The only animation that is different is that stealthy Jacob crouches. But otherwise, they both share animaitons. Leap of Faith, combat, sprinting, and parkour animation is all the same. So if you like the hooded Assassin look better, just hold down the sprint key and everything's fine.\n-CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND STORYTELLING\n(I won't spoil any of the story in this segment, I promise) The main characters are amazing. I can't even think of another word for the Unstopable Frye Twins. Jacob and Evie have a slight charm and humor to them that contrasts them from any other Assassin. Every single time Jacob spoke, I couldn't just not laugh at the sarcasticness and ignorance of his lines, and the tired but stern lines of his sister Evie putting up with his nonsense in a cute manner. The other characters that you meet throughout the game are also as exciting and full of wit. Everyone's character development, even the villian's, make this Assassin's Creed totally differrent by adding a great sense of humor alongside the action packed story. In fact, by Sequence 3 I had already got so attatched to the characters, that when a glitch occured that accidentely killed Evie, I was extremely sad. Like a new level of sad. You probably won't know what it's like to see the body of one of your favorite characters folded on the street curb, trampled by a horse. What was this glitch you might ask. Well I'll tell you.\nCONS:\n-ANIMATIONS AND BUGS\n(This will probably be the only category under cons, because me being a casual gamer, I haven't found anything extremely wrong with the game, just some things that may bug you if you buy it)\nAnyways...this glitch I was talking about. As I stepped off the carriage that Evie was riding in with me, I focused my camera angle on what was ahead of me but not behind me. I heard a whipping noise, than a neigh. I turned around to see the carriage I had taken zoom away, leaving behind the trampled ragdoll of Evie. The game then desynched me saying that \"My ally was dead\" or \"Target Dead\". I forgot. Leaving me heartbroken, the game then decieded to set me back to a position that I had played at least 5 min before and I had to redo everything. I'm sure there are many other bugs that I haven't found but I hope you enjoyed my story. ALSO. Another thing that may bother you is that Jacob and Evie, while in combat or assassinations, will use their right hands to stab their enemies. And it looks like they're using a hidden blade too. This only bothers me so much because as I recall, they only used their gauntlet blade for stuff like that. I've also noticed that no blade extends from the right sleeve. It looks like they are doing some sort of martial art death punch beacuse when the wrist makes contact with the enemy a spurt of blood spills out of the enemy. I don't think Ubisoft is going to fix this either because it's integrated into the cutscenes. I don't know if this will bother you so much that you won't buy the game, but just a warning.\nWOW YOU MADE IT THROUGH!!! GOOD JOB!!!!!\nFINAL RATING--------9.2/10\nSHOULD YOU BUY THIS?

They just jumped in the story not knowing why are they doing what they are doing. Cutscenes are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing everywhere and it takes down playability. It was one of the best things in AC2 and 3 and 4 and even Unity to see what drew them to become assassins and the cutscenes where farely short but held a great message. Really only thing what to do is to do the same missions over and over, collecting small\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665everywhere and progressing way to complicated. Also the modern day story is just too vague and not that imersive, one of the main things I do miss in AC, some people like it, some dont. I dont like just watching some cutscenes and expect to actually call it a game.\nGraphics are nice, Getting good performance at high settings, even though I have a min spec comp.

Combat is challenging yet satisfying. No longer the insane kill count you could get with III, Black Flag, or even Unity some times. Now you have to be cautious with who you pick your fights with.\nRope launcher is one of the funnest tools I've every used in a game. I feel like a mid century Spider-Man swinging around London, and yet, its inclusion doesn't break the gameplay, or negate the free running aspect. Speaking of which, is far more fluid than before. You still get parts where you jump to somewhere you did not want to, but no where near the clunkiness of Unity. The have ironed out the bugs, and given it a more fluid feel, and it is a huge improvement.\nCharacters are engaging. I have only played with Jacob so far, but the quips he makes as you play throughout the game always seem to make me chuckle. Evie is alright, but I need mroe time playing with her to really flesh out her character. Jacob being more reckless and aggressive, Evie being the voice of reason, and tactical.\nGang wars are enjoyable, and feel great with combat system, and recruiting rooks, and fighting blighters is easily one of my favorite parts of this.\nOf course, no doubt everyone is curious about the performance, especially with the debacle of Unity. The game performs flawlessly in that aspect. I have a\nGTX 980 and factory clock\nIntel i5-4690k at stock clock\n16GB of RAM\nAnd it runs the game so, SO smoothly. Im getting a MINIMUM of 60fps, and easily go upwards into 85-90 in the less intensive parts of roaming. No glitches yet, no horryfiying faces, and though they may be there, I have yet to see them.\nAll in all, this is a great addition to the franchise, and adds several new gameplay elements without being to over the top. 60$ may be a little much for the game, since it is essentially the same formula, but if you enjoy the franchise this is worth picking up.\n**Old Review**\nGood so far.

It runs a whole lot better than Unity. I've played 30 mins so far, ran around to check out the graphics and controls (in crowd, too).\nI'm using GTX 780Ti (3GB VRAM), 8GB DDR3 (2133 Mhz), i7-2600k 3.4 Ghz (OC to 4.2 Ghz) and all settings are maxed out, except for PCSS-Ultra shadows (I'd need 400 MB more VRAM for that)\nGraphics settings give you a slider, it explains what settings do what exactly. However the game autodetects settings on start, NVIDIA experience suggested max settings, and works.\nIt does burn the GPU but there must be a lot less draw calls passed on to the CPU per frame, it stays relatively cold (as opposed to Unity when the PC wants to take off) Visually, it looks nice, the combat seems improved, but can't say much about that yet, as I'm about to actually start discovering London.\nIf you had doubts like I did - compare your specs with mine and decide. Seems like weaker systems can handle it on lower settings easily.

Now the gameplay is great, the new fighting system is fun and fast to learn. The new Free Run Up and Free Run Down is nice but some people think Ubisoft is pandering to the noobs. I believe it makes it easier and somewhat funner. But if you go back to playing another Assassin's Creed game you'll find yourself trying to play Syndicate style cause the systems are so different. Eagle Eye can now be used while walking for as long as you want versus being stationary and moving. Also the dynamic of Jacob and Evie are really cool. They're easily the best characters so far in a Creed game. They make me hope and wish that Ubi uses these characters again.

Yes, London is big, but that's it really. 6 hours in, and I've conquered 1/4th of London, and am just starting on the last row of skills.\nThe grappling is great.\nCombat is fine.\nEvie and Jacob have almost the exact same skill trees, except for 3 skills each the other doesn't. I've basically built the two the exact same.\nThe interplay between the two is great, even if it's very much a caricature (Jacob is the simple man, Evie is the more thoughtful woman, etc). As the two are essentially the same in terms of play, I just play Evie except for the occaisional mission in which you have to use Jacob.\nThis is the first Assassin's Creed that injects some humor throughout. It's a nice touch, and a nice break from the traditional seriousness of the franchise.\nI hate the train. :D It's so damn slow. Get those fast travel points as soon as you can.\nDifficulty wise, this is probably the easiest AC yet, though that seems to partly be due to overleveling, and even a level's difference in a fight has a large effect.\nMy gang is overleveled too, I guess. I don't really use them unless the story throws them into the fray on its own, and in those moments, my gang basically kills everything in a matter of seconds. :/\nOverall, I'm enjoying it. Largely in part to the two main characters; I just enjoy the two of them. Haven't really enjoyed the main character in an AC game since the (younger) Ezio days. We've had some gawd awful AC protagonists since then (bottoming out with Connor). Jacob and Evie are a refreshing change.\nOnly had one crash. Was transitioning from the map back to the game, and it just froze in an all white screen. The only weird issue I encountered was when I was in a kidnap mission, everytime I restrained my victim, an invisible wall would spring up, preventing me from walking forward (and, in fact, would push me backwards). I got around that by facing in the opposite direction I wanted to walk, waited for the victim to try to break free, restrained victim, and then turned around and walked. It's only occurred the one time in a kidnapping mission. All the others I've done had no issues.\nOverall technical side of the port seems great.\nParkor controls are just as good (and bad) as always.\nAt this point in the game, I'd give it a 9/10. They haven't really done much to change the AC formula, but after a long string of ACs that I didn't particularly enjoy (from a characters/story perspective), this has been a fun ride so far. It might be coloring my opinion a bit, and it's quite possible that once this initial euphoria of actually enjoying an AC story/characters again fades, I'd really be around an 8/10.", "hours": 31.3, "user_id": "76561197989957746", "username": "revial", "products": 62, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Ubisoft knows they messed up last time and while I am actually in the minority that really enjoyed Unity, I was not blind to it's problems, mainly its optimization problems. In terms of story or gameplay that's all up to the individual if they enjoy that or not, (which I personally enjoyed quite a bit). However the most important thing a game, especially on PC, needs is stability and that is what Syndicate has that Unity lacked. I have a Nvidia Geforce 750Ti and have graphics set to medium quality and so far have stayed at 55 to 60 Fps through fighting, climbing, and just roaming around the large map filled with impressive visuals and large amounts of AI. I have not come across any gamebreaking bugs as of yet (doesn't mean they might not be out there). The gameplay actually reminds me a little of GTA: San Andreas with the gang gameplay, taking over neighborhoods and being able to recruit a posse of gang members to help you fight.

This is, of course, just my experience and it does seem like some others are having some issues, but I just wanted to throw in my two cents worth.

Launched the game, it goes directly 4k intro+playing in low settings without asking anything, but when I say 4k I must say into a 1920 image so we saw only one quarter of the screen... obliged to do alt+enter, change settings and reboot the game to go full hd+ultra high.\n40 fps no drop... with a 980Gtx 12GB of RAM ok...  but... on each pictures there is alot of texture bug if you keep the MFAA option ON on nvidia's panel. So to be able to play you have to remove the MFAA option. If not, some building (the first one we have to go up to) will not be displayed at all, and some terrain texture or wall texture will be transparent or sipmply buggy scanlines...\nHave they only tested their game before puttig it online? I doubt it it...\nAlso there is a huge FPS drop rate every time the camera is moving from side to side.\nI ma also playing in french. The voice acting is not bad, but the mobs voice acting is in english while the reste of the voices are in french there for that limit a lot the possibilites of immersion fror french people and certainly foor others too.\nThe keyboard is totally useless as it breaks the smoothness of the movements of our caracter (imagined for a console with analogic stick)\nThe gameplay is way to easy to dodge now, every time a punch or a firearm is used against you will have a notice with a big letter to hit being then able to dodge everything.\nRight now I am not sure the game is worth it's 60 euros but as I have not finished the scenario  yet.\n[EDIT 2 with gamepad] So, this second part is the final review for the introduction, after having issues with nvidia MFAA, keyboard/camera/fps issues. I have now tested with a gamepad and the game finally give all what it had to give in the first hour of gameplay.\nNow with a gamepad the camera is correctly sync, no more fps drop, all fine. the action is quite repetitive but it is the start of the game so...  I have not seen much of the game yet but still it is pleasant to play. My favorite aspect of the game is behing able to play as a woman.
